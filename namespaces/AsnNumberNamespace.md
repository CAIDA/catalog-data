===schema:description
 An autonomous system is a collection of connected Internet Protocol routing
 prefixes under the control of one or more network operators on behalf of a
 single administrative entity or domain, that presents a common and clearly
 defined routing policy to the Internet. Until 2007, AS numbers were 16-bit
 unsigned integers with a range from 0 to 65,536. In 2007, AS numbers were
 expaned to 32-bit unsigned integers creating a theoretical range from 0 
 to 4,294,967,295. This range is contrasted by a set of reserved blocks, 
 limiting the set of available AS numbers.
