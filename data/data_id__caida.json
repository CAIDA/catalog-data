You would\n  typically write a perl script to analyze the output of sc_analysis_dump.\n  \n  Another tool you may want to consider is the warts-dump tool, which\n  is also included in the scamper distribution.  The output of warts-dump\n  is somewhat less easy to parse, but warts-dump prints out practically\n  all information contained in a warts file.\n\n  Finally, you can write your analysis scripts in the Ruby language\n  using rb-wartslib, an easy-to-use Ruby binding to the warts I/O\n  library.  You can learn more about it at\n\n     http://rb-wartslib.rubyforge.org/\n\n  Ruby is a great scripting language and well worth learning for its\n  own sake.  See http://www.ruby-lang.org\n\n\n\n===========================================================================\nFiles Overview\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* Traceroute data for the random routed addresses list.\n\n  There are 262k destinations.  Each destination was probed with either 3\n  probing methods (\"3meth\") or 6 (\"6meth\") during the period Aug 7-16,\n  2008.  The 3 methods are UDP-Paris, ICMP-Paris, and TCP port 80, and the\n  6 methods are UDP, UDP-Paris, UDP-Paris DNS, ICMP, ICMP-Paris, and TCP\n  port 80.\n\n  The Archipelago monitor used is indicated with \"bcn-es\", \"cjj-kr\", etc.\n  For information on monitors, see\n\n     https://www.caida.org/projects/ark/locations\n\n\n  101936654 Aug 10 02:32 trmethod-200808.3meth.bcn-es.warts.gz\n  120736106 Aug 10 03:46 trmethod-200808.3meth.cjj-kr.warts.gz\n  114995829 Aug 10 07:57 trmethod-200808.3meth.hel-fi.warts.gz\n  112490522 Aug 10 02:32 trmethod-200808.3meth.iad-us.warts.gz\n  119760657 Aug  8 18:02 trmethod-200808.3meth.san-us.warts.gz\n  103552544 Aug 13 23:11 trmethod-200808.3meth.syd-au.warts.gz\n  246036773 Aug 12 17:25 trmethod-200808.6meth.cbg-uk.warts.gz\n  220681074 Aug 16 01:21 trmethod-200808.6meth.nrt-jp.warts.gz\n\n\n* Traceroute data for the Alexa top 500 websites list.\n\n  The actual number of IP addresses included in the destination list is\n  422, as some webservers in the top 500 have IP addresses in common with\n  other webservers.  We probed each destination with 6 methods on Jan 23,\n  2008.  All measurements were conducted from brak.caida.org (which is on\n  the same network as the CAIDA Archipelago monitor san-us).\n\n     320980 Jan 24  2008 alexa-20080124.warts.gz\n\n\n* Traceroute data for the random router list.\n\n  This file contains traceroute paths from the host brak.caida.org to 2000\n  routers that appeared in a prior traceroute run conducted Jan 23-24,\n  2008.  We probed each destination with 6 methods on Jan 24, 2008.\n\n    1366635 Jan 24  2008 router2000.warts.gz\n\n\n* The source code of the version of scamper used for the random routed\n  addresses list.\n\n  Note: This is not the version of scamper used for the Alexa and router\n  lists--we unfortunately don't have a scamper snapshot for what we used.\n\n     277035 Aug 22 18:26 scamper-cvs-20080808b.tar.gz\n\n\n===========================================================================\nRelated Datasets\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere are some other CAIDA datasets that may be of interest for topology\nanalysis:\n\n * The IPv4 Routed /24 Topology Dataset\n   https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/ipv4_routed_24_topology_dataset\n\n   This dataset contains traceroute paths from the globally distributed\n   monitors of CAIDA's Archipelago measurement infrastructure to every\n   routed /24 (7+ million).  Data collection has been ongoing since Sep\n   2007.  As of Aug 2008, we have collected 1.3 billion traceroutes in\n   519GB of warts files.\n\n\n * IPv4 Routed /24 AS Links Dataset\n   https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/ipv4_routed_topology_aslinks_dataset/\n\n   This dataset provides AS links derived from the IPv4 Routed /24 Topology\n   dataset.\n\n\n * skitter Topology Dataset\n   https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/skitter/\n\n   This dataset contains traceroute paths from the globally distributed\n   monitors of CAIDA's skitter measurement infrastructure to a variety of\n   destination lists.  The skitter infrastructure was decommissioned on Feb\n   8, 2008 after nearly a decade of activity, but this historical dataset\n   may be of use for certain analyses.  We have XXX billion traceroutes in\n   4TB of arts files.\n\n"}],

[Authors](#authors)\n\n## Introduction <a name=\"introduction\"></a>\nCAIDA's Randomly and Uniformly Spoofed Denial-of-Service (RSDoS) Metadata is a dataset of DoS activity seen in the UCSD Network Telescope.\n\n## Metadata description <a name=\"metadata_description\"></a>\n\n### Inferring DoS activity <a name=\"dos_inference\"></a>\nThe inference methodology at the basis of this dataset is described in the bibliographic references listed at the end of this file. In summary, we extract, from traffic observed at the UCSD network telescope, \"backscatter\" packets (response packets) sent by victims of randomly and uniformly spoofed Denial-of-Service attacks and we infer properties of these attacks. We process raw telescope data in five-minute intervals. Within each five-minute interval statistics are kept for all potential DoS activity. Activity that relates to the same victim is summarized in an 'attack vector', meaning that each attack vector consists of a target IP address along with statistical information about the attack. Attack vectors are updated as long as related activity is observed within five minutes. Once an attack vector 'completes', its statistical information is enriched with geolocation and BGP routing metadata for the targeted IP address. All attack vectors can be uniquely identified by their target IP address and start timestamp.\n\n### Dataset contents <a name=\"dataset_contents\"></a>\nEach day of DoS inference produces a single compressed CSV file of attack vectors. The filename convention is as follows: *ucsd-nt.rsdos-daily-attacks.<yyyy>-<mm>-<dd>.ts=<start_of_yyyy-mm-dd_timestamp>.csv.gz*. Files are kept in a directory hierarchy that is partitioned per day, i.e., *year=yyyy/month=mm/day=dd/<csv_gz_file>*. This dataset contains files starting 2015-03-01 through 2017-02-28.\n\n### File format <a name=\"file_format\"></a>\n\nThe meaning of each column in the CSV file is as follows:\n\n1. target_ip\n    The IP address of the attack victim (i.e., the source IP address of the\nbackscatter packet seen by our telescope).\n\n2. nr_attacker_ips\n  The number of distinct attacker IPs in the attack  (i.e., the number of unique spoofed addresses, that is the destination IP addresses of the backscatter packets seen by our telescope).\n\n3. nr_attacker_ports\n  The number of distinct attacker ports (i.e., destination port of the backscatter packet seen by our telescope, inferred as source ports of target-destined packets) seen in the attack.\n\n4. nr_target_ports\n  The number of distinct target ports (i.e., source port of the backscatter  packet seen by our telescope, inferred as destination port of target-destined packets) seen in the attack.\n\n5. nr_packets\n  The cumulative total number of packets observed in the attack.\n\n6. nr_bytes\n  The cumulative total number of bytes seen for the attack.\n\n7. max_ppm\n  The maximum packet rate (of backscatter packets) seen in the attack, as a moving average per minute.\n\n8. start_posix_time\n  The timestamp of the first observed packet of the attack.\n\n9. end_posix_time\n  The timestamp of the last observed packet of the attack.\n\n10. asn\n  The autonomous system number of target_ip at the time of the attack, determined on the basis of RouteViews Prefix to AS mappings Dataset (pfx2as) for IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n11. country-code\n  Country geolocation of target_ip, at the time of the attack, based on Netacuity edge premium edition data.\n\n12. continent-code\n  Continent geolocation of target_ip, at the time of the attack, based on Netacuity edge premium edition data.\n\n\n## Prior Work <a name=\"prior_work\"></a>\n\nThis dataset builds on work by Jonker et al., used in their paper:\n*Jonker, M., King, A., Krupp, J., Rossow, C., Sperotto, A. and Dainotti, A., 2017. Millions of targets under attack: a macroscopic characterization of the DoS ecosystem. In Proceedings of the ACM 2017 Internet Measurement Conference (pp. 100-113).*\n\nTheir work in turn builds on the methodology described in:\n*Moore, D., Shannon, C., Brown, D.J., Voelker, G.M. and Savage, S., 2006.

ASes are an important abstraction\nbecause they are the \"unit of routing policy\" in the routing system of the\nglobal Internet. ASes peer with each other to exchange traffic, and these\npeering relationships define the high-level global Internet topology. For\nthe purposes of analysis, these peering relationships are represented with\nan AS graph, where nodes represent ASes and links represent peering\nrelationships.\n\nThe IPv4 Routed /24 AS Links Dataset provides regular snapshots of AS links\nderived from the ongoing traceroute-like IP-level topology measurements\nthat make up our IPv4 Routed /24 Topology Dataset [1]. We have collected this\nIP-level topology data since September 2007 using our next generation\nArchipelago (Ark) measurement infrastructure. For AS links data prior to\nSeptember 2007, please see the related Skitter AS Links Dataset [2] (skitter AS\nlinks are no longer being collected).\n\nData from the IPv4 Routed /24 Topology Dataset are processed by using\nRouteViews BGP data to identify the Autonomous System (AS) associated with\neach responding IP address and collapsing the original probed IP paths into\na set of links between ASes. The process of converting IP addresses into\nAutonomous Systems involves potential distortion due to: \n\n    *  No AS mapping for the IP address: some IP addresses appear in\n       topology probes but are not advertised by any AS;\n    *  AS Sets: an aggregated set of ASes advertises the prefix;\n    *  Multi-origin ASes (aka MOASes): several separate ASes advertise the\n       same prefix).\n\nAS Sets and Multi-origin ASes are identified specifically in the AS Links\nfiles; for more information, see the file format description in the data\nfile header.\n\nOnce IP addresses have been mapped to ASes, two types of AS links can be\nobserved: direct links, in which two adjacent IP addresses map to two\ndifferent ASes, and indirect links, in which two IP addresses in different\nASes are separated by one or more hops for which we could not identify an\nAS (because some hops were non-responding or because we were not able to\nidentify an AS for the IP address at a given hop). Indirect links are\nannotated with the size of the gap between ASes as measured in IP hops. \n\nThe current AS Links dataset fixes a few bugs in the skitter-based\nAS-links generation software:\n\n- The previous generation technique reported the first known\n  link between two ASes, so if both an indirect and a direct\n  link between the ASes was observed, and the indirect link\n  was seen first, only an indirect link between the ASes\n  would be reported.

Now, if an indirect link with\n  a smaller gap size is observed, the smaller gap size is reported.\n\n\n===========================================================================\nDATA FORMAT\n===========================================================================\n\nThe format of each AS links file is described within the header of\nthe file itself.  The IPv4 Routed /24 Topology Dataset from which\nthis AS Links data is derived uses separate teams that independently\nprobe every routed /24 in the IPv4 address space.  Because different\nteams have different members, locations, and capabilities, each\nteam completes a cycle of probing every routed /24 at a different\nrate.  \n\nThe directory structure is organized as team-<TEAM-ID>/YEAR/FILE.\nFor example,\n\n   team-1/2008/cycle-aslinks.l7.t1.c000065.20080102.txt.gz\n\nThe components of the path are\n\n  TEAM-ID: the unique identifier of the team that did measurements,\n\n  YEAR: the year (UTC) in which the underlying topology data used\n        to generate the AS links files was collected, and\n\n  FILE: the AS links filename in the following format:\n\n    cycle-aslinks.l<LIST-ID>.t<TEAM-ID>.c<CYCLE-NUMBER>.DATE.txt.gz\n\n    where\n\n      LIST-ID is the list in use for the probing (multiple teams\n              can probe the same list; list 7 is the IPv4 Routed /24\n              Topology Dataset),\n\n      TEAM-ID is the same team identifier as in the path,\n\n      CYCLE-NUMBER is a counter of probing cycles through a list done by\n              *all teams* probing that list, and\n\n      DATE is the date in UTC of the start of that probe cycle.\n\n\nWe have tried to make it easy for you to set up an automated process to\ndownload new AS links files as they are produced.  The best way to do\nthis is to download the file aslinks-creation.log once a day.  Whenever\nwe provide a new file for download, we add a new line to this log file.\nSimply download and examine this log file to discover which new files\nhave been added since your last batch of downloads.  See the comments\nin the log file for further details.\n\n\n===========================================================================\nDATA USE TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n===========================================================================\n\nThe AUA for these publicly-available data is included in pdf format as a\nseparate file, caida_aua.pdf, in the same directory as this README file.\n\nWhen referencing this data (as required by the AUA), please use:\n\n    The IPv4 Routed /24 AS Links Dataset - <dates used>,\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/ipv4_routed_topology_aslinks_dataset.\n\nAlso, please, report your publication to CAIDA\n  (https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/publications/report-publication).\n\n\n===========================================================================\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n===========================================================================\n\n    Special thanks to Matthew Luckie for development of and assistance with\n    scamper.\n\n\nThe IPv4 Routed /24 AS Links Dataset was sponsored by:\n\n    * National Science Foundation\n    * Department of Homeland Security\n    * Cisco Systems\n\n\n===========================================================================\nREFERENCES\n===========================================================================\n\n[1] IPv4 Routed /24 Topology Dataset:\n\thttps://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/ipv4_routed_24_topology_dataset\n[2] Skitter AS Links Dataset:\n\thttps://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/skitter_aslinks_dataset\n[3] University of Oregon RouteViews Project:\n\thttp://www.routeviews.org/\n[4] Archipelago Project\n\thttps://www.caida.org/projects/ark/\n\n"}],

For example, DNS\nnames of routers often encode the link type (backbone vs. access),\nlink capacity, Point of Presence (PoP), and geographic location.  We\nhave DNS Names data starting March 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nThese datasets result from CAIDA's large-scale traceroute-based\nmeasurements running on the <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/projects/ark\">Archipelago (Ark)</a> measurement\ninfrastructure (also see CAIDA's <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/projects/macroscopic/\">Macroscopic Topology</a> Project).\n</p>\n<p>\nWe perform these DNS lookups centrally at CAIDA using a custom-built\nbulk DNS lookup service.  This service performs millions of DNS\nlookups per day. In general, we perform DNS lookups soon after we\ncollect the topology traces so that the results better match the state\nof the Internet at trace collection time.  However, to avoid undue load\non remote DNS nameservers and to keep the daily lookup volume at a\nmanageable level, we never perform a lookup for an address if we have\nsuccessfully obtained a result in the preceding 7 days. Apart from this\n7-day rule, we always perform a lookup whenever we encounter an IP\naddress in traces. This means that we do repeat lookups at 7-day\ngranularity for addresses that repeatedly occur in the traces.\nIf the first attempt to look up a given IP address fails, then we\nretry up to two more times, waiting about one day between retries.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn addition to the DNS names we have in the past provided the daily trace files\ncontaining DNS query and response traffic resulting from these DNS\nlookups. This was discontinued in April 2014, because of a change\nin the data collection procedure.\nThese traces capture the DNS traffic between our\nlocal recursive name server and global DNS servers (rather than the\nless useful final DNS results seen by DNS clients). These data\nare available in two forms: the most recent 30 days of DNS traffic\nfiles (i.e. from 30 days upto the current day); and a\nhistoric collection of DNS traces about three weeks long at\nquarterly intervals going back to July 2008. Traces are\navailable in two formats: a standard pcap file, and a textual dump\nof each pcap file containing the most useful values from the DNS\nresponses.\n</p>\n<h3>Data availability</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\t\tData <b>older than one year</b> is available as a public dataset.

For example, DNS\nnames of routers often encode the link type (backbone vs. access),\nlink capacity, Point of Presence (PoP), and geographic location.  We\nhave DNS Names data starting March 2008.\n\nThese datasets result from CAIDA's large-scale traceroute-based\nmeasurements running on the Archipelago (Ark) [2] measurement\ninfrastructure (also see CAIDA's Macroscopic Topology Project [3]).\n\n\n===========================================================================\nABOUT DNS LOOKUPS\n===========================================================================\n\nWe perform these DNS lookups centrally at CAIDA using a custom-built\nbulk DNS lookup service.  This service performs millions of DNS\nlookups per day.\n\nIn general, we perform DNS lookups soon after we collect the topology\ntraces so that the results better match the state of the Internet\nat trace collection time.  However, to avoid undue load on remote\nDNS nameservers and to keep the daily lookup volume at a manageable\nlevel, we never perform a lookup for an address if we have successfully\nobtained a result in the preceding 7 days.  Apart from this 7-day\nrule, we always perform a lookup whenever we encounter an IP address\nin traces.  This means that we do repeat lookups at 7-day granularity\nfor addresses that repeatedly occur in the traces.\n\nIf the first attempt to look up a given IP address fails, then we\nretry up to two more times, waiting about one day between retries.\n\n\n===========================================================================\nFINDING DATA OF INTEREST\n===========================================================================\n\nSeveral teams of monitors produce the IPv4 Routed /24 Topology Dataset\nfrom which we derive this DNS Names data.  These teams independently\nprobe every routed /24 in the IPv4 address space (one pass through\nevery routed /24 is called a cycle).  Because different teams have\ndifferent members, locations, and capabilities, each team completes a\ncycle at a different rate.\n\nAlthough we provide topology data on a per-team and per-cycle basis\n(matching the data collection process), we provide DNS Names data on a\nper-day basis because of the special requirements of performing DNS\nlookups.  Therefore, only a loose connection exists between cycles as\ndescribed above and the DNS Names files made available for download.\nSpecifically, DNS Names files are organized into daily files without\nany regard for the underlying cycles, and a single DNS Names file\nincludes lookup results for traces collected by *all* teams.\n\nFurthermore, the contents of a daily DNS Names file is determined\nsolely by when we obtain a DNS lookup result and not by when an IP\naddress was scheduled for lookup.  For example, if we see an IP\naddress in a trace on December 14th, and submit the address for lookup\non December 15th, but only receive a DNS response from a remote DNS\nserver on December 16th (after retries), then the result will be\nstored in the daily file for the response date, the 16th, and not the\nsubmission date, the 15th, nor the date of observation in traces, the\n14th.\n\nTherefore, there is no simple 1-to-1 mapping between cycles and DNS\nNames files, but users can match up the DNS Names files to the raw\ntopology files of a cycle in the following way (all dates are in UTC):\n\n  1. Figure out the time period for the cycle, say days A to B\n      (e.g., 2008-09-08 to 2008-09-10),\n\n  2. Download all DNS Names files from A minus seven (A-7) days\n     to B plus seven (B+7) days (it's not a lot of data), and\n\n  3. Find the closest DNS Names result for each IP address by\n     examining the timestamp of the result and the timestamp of\n     the trace where the IP address of interest occurs.\n\nNote: In some cases, the user may need to examine DNS Names files\nbeyond B plus seven (B+7) days, if our bulk DNS lookup service\nexperiences unscheduled downtime, though we do not expect that to\nhappen often.\n\n\n===========================================================================\nDIRECTORY ORGANIZATION\n===========================================================================\n\nWe use the following directory naming convention on our\nhttp://topo-data.caida.org/ web server.\n\n  /team-probing/list-7.allpref24/dns-names/YEAR/MONTH/FILE\n\nFor example,\n\n   .../dns-names/2008/09/dns-names.l7.20080901.txt.gz \n\nThe YEAR and MONTH give the UTC date of the DNS results.  The\nFILE component follows the following naming convention \n\n  dns-names.l<LIST-ID>.DATE.txt.gz\n\nwhere\n\n  LIST-ID is the destination list used for the underlying\n          topology measurements (list 7 is the IPv4 Routed /24\n          Topology Dataset), and\n\n  DATE is the UTC date at which we received the DNS results.\n\nWe have tried to make it easy for you to set up an automated process to\ndownload new DNS Names files as they are produced.  The best way to do\nthis is to download the file \n\n  /team-probing/list-7.allpref24/dns-names/dnsnames-creation.log\n\nonce a day.  Whenever we provide a new file for download, we add a new\nline to this log file.  Simply download and examine this log file to\ndiscover which new files have been added since your last batch of\ndownloads.  See the comments in the log file for further details.\n\n\n===========================================================================\nFILE FORMAT\n===========================================================================\n\nDNS Names files contain one DNS mapping per line, with the following\nfields separated by tabs:\n\n   timestamp   IP_address      hostname\n\nFor example,\n\n   1220248003  130.241.54.1    gu54a-gw.gu.se\n\nThe timestamp indicates when we obtained the DNS result.  More\nprecisely, the timestamp records the time at which we sent the DNS\nquery to a remote DNS server.  The DNS response arrives shortly\nthereafter (typically, in less than a few seconds), so the timestamp\nis approximately equal to the arrival of the DNS result.  (This\ntimestamp is much closer to the arrival of the DNS result than to the\ntime at which a given IP address was scheduled to be looked up in the\nsystem, which could have been hours or days before.)\n\nWe lowercase the hostnames of successful results, and use uppercase\ncharacters to indicate lookup errors.  Here are some examples of errors:\n\n  FAIL.NON-AUTHORITATIVE.in-addr.arpa\n  FAIL.SERVER-FAILURE.in-addr.arpa\n  FAIL.TIMEOUT.in-addr.arpa\n\nSome hostnames have \"invalid\" characters.  However, we use the strict\ndefinition of validity described in the DNS RFCs; namely, only\nalphanumeric and hyphen are \"valid\" characters.  The most common\n\"invalid\" character is underscore, but there are others like\nspace, tab, newline, /, !, (, ), and non-7bit characters; for example,\n\n  spam.complaints.(555)123-2345.senior.support.ticket#1-23456789\n\nWe escape all \"invalid\" characters by replacing them with \"\\x\"\nfollowed by 2 hex digits; for example, \"\\x09\" for a tab.\n\nTo unescape printable characters (which doesn't include tabs), you can\nrun the following perl script (unescape-dnsnames):\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n#!/usr/bin/env perl\n\nuse strict;\n\nsub unescape\n{\n my ($hn) = @_;\n\n my $c = chr(hex($hn));\n return ($c =~ /[[:print:]]/ ? $c : \"\\\\x$hn\");\n}\n\nwhile (<>) {\n s/\\\\x([0-9a-f]{2})/unescape($1)/ge;\n print;\n}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can run the script on the command-line like this:\n\n  $ gzip -dc dns-names.l7.20080901.txt.gz | unescape-dnsnames\n\n\n===========================================================================\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n===========================================================================\n\nThe IPv4 Routed /24 DNS Names Dataset was sponsored by:\n\n    * National Science Foundation\n    * Department of Homeland Security\n    * WIDE Project\n    * Cisco Systems\n\n\n===========================================================================\nREFERENCES\n===========================================================================\n\n[1] IPv4 Routed /24 Topology Dataset:\n\thttps://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/ipv4_routed_24_topology_dataset\n\n[2] Archipelago Project\n\thttps://www.caida.org/projects/ark/\n\n[3] Macroscopic Topology Project\n        https://www.caida.org/projects/macroscopic/\n\n\n$Header: /cvs/Production/datasets/allpref24-dns-names/README,v 1.7 2008/11/18 01:14:39 youngh Exp $\n\n"}],

This recursive process stops either if no new addresses are revealed or if the new trace does not go through a potential endpoint of an invisible tunnel revealed by the original trace. \nFor more information see:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2017/papers/imc17-final75.pdf\">Y.

Destinations are selected randomly\nfrom each routed IPv4 /24 prefix on the Internet such that a random address in each\nprefix is probed approximately every 24 hours (one probing cycle).

ASes are an important abstraction\nbecause they are the \"unit of routing policy\" in the routing system of the\nglobal Internet. ASes peer with each other to exchange traffic, and these\npeering relationships define the high-level global Internet topology. For\nthe purposes of analysis, these peering relationships are represented with\nan AS graph, where nodes represent ASes and links represent peering\nrelationships.\n\nThe IPv6 AS Links Dataset provides regular snapshots of AS links\nderived from the ongoing traceroute-like IP-level topology measurements\nthat make up our IPv6 Topology Dataset [1]. We have collected this\nIP-level topology data since December 2008 using our next generation\nArchipelago (Ark) [3] measurement infrastructure.\n\nData from the IPv6 Topology Dataset are processed by using\nRouteViews [2] BGP data to identify the Autonomous System (AS) associated with\neach responding IP address and collapsing the original probed IP paths into\na set of links between ASes. The process of converting IP addresses into\nAutonomous Systems involves potential distortion due to: \n\n    *  No AS mapping for the IP address: some IP addresses appear in\n       topology probes but are not advertised by any AS;\n    *  AS Sets: an aggregated set of ASes advertises the prefix;\n    *  Multi-origin ASes (aka MOASes): several separate ASes advertise the\n       same prefix).\n\nAS Sets and Multi-origin ASes are identified specifically in the AS Links\nfiles; for more information, see the file format description in the data\nfile header.\n\nOnce IP addresses have been mapped to ASes, two types of AS links can be\nobserved: direct links, in which two adjacent IP addresses map to two\ndifferent ASes, and indirect links, in which two IP addresses in different\nASes are separated by one or more hops for which we could not identify an\nAS (because some hops were non-responding or because we were not able to\nidentify an AS for the IP address at a given hop). Indirect links are\nannotated with the size of the gap between ASes as measured in IP hops. \n\n\n===========================================================================\nDATA FORMAT\n===========================================================================\n\nThe format of each AS links file is described within the header of\nthe file itself.\n\nThe directory structure is organized as YEAR/MONTH/FILE.\nFor example,\n\n   2008/12/cycle-aslinks.l8.20081231.1230702738.san-us.txt.gz\n\nThe components of the path are\n\n  YEAR and MONTH: the year and month (UTC) in which the underlying \n        topology data used to generate the AS links files was\n        collected, and\n\n  FILE: the AS links filename in the following format:\n\n    cycle-aslinks.l<LIST-ID>.DATE.POSIX.MONITOR.txt.gz\n\n    where\n\n      LIST-ID is the list in use for the probing (list 8 is the\n              IPv6 Topology Dataset),\n\n      DATE    is the date in UTC of the start of that probe cycle.\n\n      POSIX   is the posix time for the start of the probe cycle.\n\n      MONITOR is the name of the Ark monitor used\n\n\nWe have tried to make it easy for you to set up an automated process to\ndownload new AS links files as they are produced.  The best way to do\nthis is to download the file aslinks-creation.log once a day.  Whenever\nwe provide a new file for download, we add a new line to this log file.\nSimply download and examine this log file to discover which new files\nhave been added since your last batch of downloads.  See the comments\nin the log file for further details.\n\n\n===========================================================================\nDATA USE TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n===========================================================================\n\nThe AUA for these data is included in pdf format as a separate file in\nthe same directory as this README file.\n\nWhen referencing this data (as required by the AUA), please use:\n\n    The IPv6 AS Links Dataset - <dates used>,\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/ipv6_aslinks_dataset.\n\nAlso, please, report your publication to CAIDA\n  (https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/publications/report-publication).\n\n\n===========================================================================\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n===========================================================================\n\n    Special thanks to Matthew Luckie for development of and assistance with\n    scamper.\n\n\nThe IPv6 AS Links Dataset was sponsored by:\n\n    * National Science Foundation\n    * Department of Homeland Security\n    * Cisco Systems\n\n\n===========================================================================\nREFERENCES\n===========================================================================\n\n[1] IPv6 Topology Dataset:\n\thttps://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/ipv6_allpref_topology_dataset/\n[2] University of Oregon RouteViews Project:\n\thttp://www.routeviews.org/\n[3] Archipelago Project\n\thttps://www.caida.org/projects/ark/\n\n"}],

For example, DNS\nnames of routers often encode the link type (backbone vs. access),\nlink capacity, Point of Presence (PoP), and geographic location.  We\nhave IPv6 DNS Names data starting June 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\nThese datasets result from CAIDA's large-scale traceroute-based\nmeasurements running on the <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/projects/ark\">Archipelago (Ark)</a> measurement\ninfrastructure (also see CAIDA's <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/projects/macroscopic/\">Macroscopic Topology</a> Project).\n</p>\n<p>\nWe perform these DNS lookups centrally at CAIDA using a custom-built\nbulk DNS lookup service.  This service performs millions of DNS\nlookups per day. In general, we perform DNS lookups soon after we\ncollect the topology traces so that the results better match the state\nof the Internet at trace collection time.  However, to avoid undue load\non remote DNS nameservers and to keep the daily lookup volume at a\nmanageable level, we never perform a lookup for an address if we have\nsuccessfully obtained a result in the preceding 36 hours. Apart from this\n36-hour rule, we always perform a lookup whenever we encounter an IP\naddress in traces. This means that we do repeat lookups at 36-hour\ngranularity for addresses that repeatedly occur in the traces.\n</p>\n<h3>Data availability</h3>\n<p>\n<b>\nThese data are available as a public dataset.\n</b>\n</p>\n<h3>Acceptable Use Agreement</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Access to these data is subject to the terms of the following CAIDA Acceptable Use Agreement</b>\n(<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/about/legal/aua/caida_pub_aua.pdf\">printable version</a> in PDF format)<br>\n<textarea xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\" rows=\"20\" cols=\"100%\" readonly style=\"background-color:#eee;border:thin solid black;\">\nCAIDA ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT for PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE DATASETS\n\nThe following terms comprise the Acceptable Use Policy and Data License Agreement for all publicly accessible datasets (the \"Public Agreement\") made available by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), a research unit at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and governed by The Regents of the University of California.\n\nLICENSE\n\nCAIDA's authorization to access the data grants You a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, and terminable license to copy, modify, and use the data in accordance with this Public Agreement.

The focus of this measurement\nis on discovering topology and not on finding responding destinations.\nA globally distributed set of <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/projects/ark/\">Archipelago</a>\n(Ark) monitors has continuously collected this data since December 12, 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe use <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/scamper/\">scamper</a> to perform\nICMP-based traceroutes using the\n<a href=\"http://www.paris-traceroute.net\">Paris traceroute</a>\ntechnique.  For each probed path, we collect the IP address,\nRTT, reply TTL, and ICMP responses for all hops, including intermediate hops.\n</p>\n<p>\nEach Ark monitor probes all announced IPv6 prefixes (/48 or\nshorter) once every 24 hours.  One probing pass through all announced\nprefixes is called a <i>cycle</i>.  In each cycle, a monitor probes a single random destination in each prefix as well as the ::1 of the prefix.  Different monitors\nprobe prefixes in independently-chosen random orders and probe to an\nindependently-chosen random destination in each prefix.  Prefixes are\nrandomly ordered in such a way that a given monitor never probes the\nsame prefix within 16 hours across cycle boundaries (a monitor can never\nre-probe a prefix within the same cycle, by definition).\n \n</p>\n<p>\n<dated>\n\nFor more information on deployed Ark monitors visit <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/projects/ark/locations/\">Ark monitors interactive map</a>.\n\n</dated>\n</p>\n<h3>Data availability</h3>\n<p>\n<b>\nThe IPv6 Ark topology data are available as a public dataset since February 2014.\n</b>\n</p>\n<h3>Acceptable Use Agreement</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Access to these data is subject to the terms of the following CAIDA Acceptable Use Agreement</b>\n(<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/about/legal/aua/caida_pub_aua.pdf\">printable version</a> in PDF format)<br>\n<textarea xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\" rows=\"20\" cols=\"100%\" readonly style=\"background-color:#eee;border:thin solid black;\">\nCAIDA ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT for PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE DATASETS\n\nThe following terms comprise the Acceptable Use Policy and Data License Agreement for all publicly accessible datasets (the \"Public Agreement\") made available by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), a research unit at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and governed by The Regents of the University of California.\n\nLICENSE\n\nCAIDA's authorization to access the data grants You a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, and terminable license to copy, modify, and use the data in accordance with this Public Agreement.

The\nfirst topology is derived from aliases resolved with\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/midar/\">MIDAR</a>\nand\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/iffinder/\">iffinder</a>,\nwhich yield the highest confidence aliases with very low false positives.\nThe second topology also uses MIDAR and iffinder but further includes\naliases resolved with\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/kapar/\">kapar</a>,\nwhich significantly increases the coverage\nof aliases but at the cost of false positives (which inflate the\nsize of routers and decrease the router count).  Researchers should\nchoose the topology to use depending on the relative importance they\nplace on accuracy vs. comprehensiveness of alias resolution.\nChoose the most accurate alias resolution if uncertain about which to use.\n</p>\n<p>\nEach router-level topology is provided in two files, one giving the nodes\nand another giving the links.  There are additional files that assign\nASes to each node, provide the geographic location of each node, and\nprovide the DNS name of each observed interface.\n</p>\n<div class=\"itdkbox\">\n<h4 style=\"margin-top:0px\">Nodes File</h4>\n<p>\n  The <b>nodes file</b> \n  lists the set of\n  interfaces that were inferred to be on each router. \n  </p>\n<p>\n  File format:\n  <span style=\"background-color:lightgrey; padding:4px\"><code>\n\t  node &lt;node_id&gt;: &nbsp; &lt;i<sub>1</sub>&gt; &nbsp; &lt;i<sub>2</sub>&gt; &nbsp; ... &nbsp; &lt;i<sub>n</sub>&gt;\n  </code></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  Each line indicates that a node <i>node_id</i> has \n  interfaces <i>i<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>i<sub>n</sub></i>.\n  Interface addresses in 224.0.0.0/3 (IANA reserved space for multicast)\n  are not real addresses.\n  They were\n  artificially generated\n  to identify potentially unique non-responding interfaces in\n  traceroute paths.\n  <blockquote>\n<b>NOTE: In ITDK release 2013-04 and earlier, we used addresses in\n             0.0.0.0/8 instead of 224.0.0.0/3 for these non-real addresses.</b>\n</blockquote>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"itdkbox\">\n<h4 style=\"margin-top:0px\">Links File</h4>\n<p>\n  The <b>links file</b> lists the set of routers and router interfaces that\n  were inferred to be sharing each link.\n  Note that these are IP layer links, not physical cables or\n  graph edges.

A single origin AS typically announces\n     (\"originates\") each routable prefix via BGP.  We perform  \n     IP-to-AS mapping by assigning an IP address to the origin AS of\n     the longest matching prefix for that IP address in the BGP tables.\n</p>\n<h2>AS relationships\n<div style=\"background-color:#D5DE33;width:100%;height:10px\">\n       &nbsp;</div>\n</h2>\n<p>\n     We used the BGP data to annotate each interdomain link with one of\n     three simplified business relationships -- customer-provider (the customer\n     pays the provider), settlement-free peer (typically no money is\n     exchanged), and sibling (both ASes belong to the same\n     organization) -- using the classification algorithm by\n    <a href=\"https://catalog.caida.org/details/paper/2013_asrank/\">Luckie <i> et al.</i></a>, resulting in what we call the\n\t<i><a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/as-relationships/index\">\n\tAS relationship dataset</a></i>.\n   </p>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"AS-assignment\"> AS assignment</a>\n<div style=\"background-color:#DDB757;width:100%;height:10px\">\n       &nbsp;</div>\n</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;\" src=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/internet-topology-data-kit/images/road_map-crop.svg\"><p>\nBordermapIT, <i>bdrmapIT</i>, combines the AS inference heuristics found \nin both bdrmap and MAP-IT.  By synthesis of these two techniques,\n<i>bdrmapIT</i> is designed to accurately\nidentify interdomain links in a traceroute dataset using a graph refinement\nstrategy. Our algorithm proceeds as follows:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li> The first step (Graph Construction) processes the traceroutes,\n     extracting paths and generating a prioritized graph of the interfaces.\n    This interface graph is used by our heuristics in Step 3\n    to infer router ownership and interdomain links.</li>\n<li> In the second step (Graph Initialization), we use the paths and\n    alias resolution to annotate routers that always appear at the end of a\n    traceroute. We process these first since we are unable to refine these\n    inferences later.</li>\n<li>Finally, in the third step (Graph Refinement), we use the graph\n    refinement loop to annotate the remaining routers and interfaces using the\n    prioritized interface graph and the path data. After each iteration of\n    the loop we refine the inferences, enabling additional accuracy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nFor further details, please see the papers \n<a href=\"https://catalog.caida.org/details/paper/2016_bdrmap/\">bdrmap: Inference of Borders\nBetween IP Networks</a> and \n<a href=\"https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~amarder/resources/mapit.pdf\">MAP-IT:\nMultipass Accurate Passive Inferences from Traceroute</a>.\n</p>\n<h2 style=\"clear:both\">Geolocation\n<div style=\"background-color:#4EC42D;width:100%;height:10px\">\n       &nbsp;</div>\n</h2>\n<p>\nWe use a combination of publicly known Internet eXchange (IX) point\ninformation, <a href=\"http://ddec.caida.org\">DDec</a> hostname mapping, and \nMaxMind's free <a href=\"http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity\">GeoLite City\ndatabase</a> to provide the geographic location (at city granularity)\nof routers in the router-level graph.</p>\n<p> We generated an internal IX database containing information combined\nfrom:<a href=\"http://www.bgplookingglass.com/ixp-database\"> BGP Looking\nglass database</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_exchange_points\">\nWikipedia's list of Internet Exchange Points</a>, <a href=\"https://www.peeringdb.com/\">PeeringDB</a>, and <a href=\"https://prefix.pch.net/applications/ixpdir/menu_download.php\"> PCH's\nIX database</a>. The geographic city names are then mapped to \n<a href=\"http://www.geonames.org/\">Geoname</a>'s locations. \nThis data provides a set of geographic locations and\nprefixes for each IX.  A router is mapped to an IX's location if the router \ncontains at least one interface from the IX's address space and the IX is\nlocated in a single city.\n</p>\n<p> We then collect the hostnames for interfaces on routers that\nare not geolocated to an IX.  These hostnames are then mapped to\ngeographic locations using DDec's heuristics.</p>\n<p> All remaining routers are geolocated using MaxMind Lite. \nBecause this database maps\nindividual IP addresses to locations, we take the following steps to\nfind the location of each router (which by definition has multiple\ninterfaces).  We first map each interface on a router to a location.\nIf all interfaces map to the same location, then we assign that\nlocation to the router; otherwise, we do not assign any location to\nthe router (that is, the router does not appear in the geolocation\nfile).\n</p>\n<p> In order to evaluate the accuracy of these methods, we compared the\ndistance between the inferred geographic location and the geographic\nlocation of collection of routers which were with a 3 millisecond of \nthe known location of an <a href=\"https://atlas.ripe.net/\">Atlas monitor</a>. \nMaxMind provided geographic locations for the largest number of routers with 1980.\nIt was followed by DDec with 848 and IX with 349 routers. Accuracy was the inverse with \nIX mapping 92% of it's routers to with in 10 km. DDec had 67% routers with in\n10 km. MaxMind only had 33% with in 10 km. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}, {"name": "README.txt", "format": "text", "content": "Two historic ITDKs based on skitter data (ITDK-2002-04 and ITDK-2003-04),\nthat were included with this collection of Ark-based ITDKs until\nDecember 2012, are now available as public datasets.

We first use a ground-truth dataset from\n     PeeringDB (described next), and split it into two parts to create\n     a labeled training and validation set. We then train a\n     machine-learning classifier using a number of features for each\n     AS (described next) to train a decision-tree machine-learning\n     classifier. \n   </p>\n<h2>Ground-truth dataset</h2>\n<p>\n     To train and validate our classification approach, we use\n     ground-truth data from <a href=\"http://www.peeringdb.com\">PeeringDB</a>, the largest source of\n     self-reported data about the properties of ASes. From PeeringDB,\n     we extract the self-reported business type of each AS, which is\n     one of \"Cable/DSL/ISP\", \"NSP\" (Network Service Provider),\n     \"Content\", \"Education/Research\", \"Enterprise\" and\n     \"Non-profit\". We combine the \"Cable/DSL/ISP\" and \"NSP\" classes\n     into a single class \"Transit/Access\". We ignore the \"Non-profit\"\n     category for the purposes of this classification. The labeled\n     ground-truth data thus consists of three classes:\n     \"Transit/Access\", \"Content\" and \"Enterprise\". As PeeringDB\n     under-represents the \"Enterprise\" category, we manually assemble\n     a set of 500 networks which we determine to be enterprise\n     customers based on their WHOIS records and webpages, and add this\n     set to the labeled classification data. \n   </p>\n<h2>Classifier features</h2>\n<p>\n  We use the following features for each AS in the training and\n  validation set.\n</p>\n<p>\n    1) Customer, provider and peer degrees: We obtain the number of\n    customers, providers and peers (at the AS-level) using <a href=\"https://asrank.caida.org\">CAIDA's AS-rank data</a>.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    2) Size of customer cone in number of ASes: We obtain the size of\n    an AS' customer cone using <a href=\"https://asrank.caida.org\">CAIDA's AS-rank data</a>.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    3) Size of the IPv4 address space advertised by that AS. We obtain\n    this quantity using BGP routing tables collected from Routeviews.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    4) Number of domains from the Alexa top 1 million list hosted by\n    the AS. We obtain the list of top 1 million websites from <a href=\"http://www.alexa.com\">Alexa</a>,\n    perform DNS lookups on each domain (at CAIDA) and map each\n    returned IP address to the corresponding ASN using longest-prefix\n    matching using a routing table from Routeviews. We then count the\n    number of domains hosted by each AS. \n  </p>\n<p>\n    5) Fraction of an AS's advertised space that is seen as active in\n    the <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/projects/network_telescope/\">UCSD Network Telescope</a>.\n  </p>\n<h2>Validation</h2>\n<p>\n  We use half of the ground-truth data to validate the\n  machine-learning classifier.

These\nfacilities lease customers secure space to locate and operate network\nequipment. They also provide power, cooling, fire protection,\ndedicated cabling to support different types of network connection, and\nin many cases administrative support. Most interconnection\nfacilities are  carrier-neutral, although some are operated by\ncarriers. In large communication hubs, such as in\nlarge cities, an interconnection facility operator may operate\nmultiple facilities in the same city, and connect them, so that\nnetworks participating at one facility can access networks at another\nfacility in the same city.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Internet Exchange Point (IXP)</b>: a  physical\ninfrastructure composed of layer-2 Ethernet switches, where\nparticipating networks can interconnect their  routers\nusing the switch fabric. Each IXP has one or more core\nswitches. IXPs partner with interconnection facilities in\nthe city where they operate, and install access switches at\nthose facilities, connecting these switches to the core\nswitch. Routers owned by members of an IXP may be located\nat different facilities associated with the same IXP.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Interconnection Types</b>:\nThe interconnection type reveals the method used to connect two routers\nbelonging to different companies (Figure 2): \n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Private Peering with Cross-connect</b> uses a dedicated\npiece of circuit-switched network equipment\nthat physically connects the interfaces of two networks\npresent at the interconnection facility.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Public Peering</b> (also referred to as <b>Public Interconnect</b>) \nis an interconnection between two\nmembers of an IXP via the IXP's switch fabric.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Private Interconnects over IXP</b> (tethering) establishes\na point-to-point virtual private line over the IXP's public switch fabric.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Remote Peering</b> leverages transport networks\nto connect one's router to the IXP via an Ethernet-over-MPLS connection.\nIn this way, one can peer with members at the facility without\ndeploying (and maintaining) hardware there.  </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h2>Methodology for Mapping AS interconnections to Facilities</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"image\" style=\"width:305px;float:right;\">\n<img src=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/as-facilities/images/Mapping2Facilities.PNG\" width=\"300\" height=\"320\"><p style=\"font-size: x-small;\">\n<b>Figure 3.</b> Overview of the interconnection-to-facility mapping process.\nUsing a large set of traceroutes toward the target ASes, we aliased the\ngathered IP addresses to routers and then mapped routers to ASes.\nThis data and the constructed list of interconnection facilities for each\nAS and IXP constituted the input into the \n<span class=\"italic\">Constrained Facility Search</span> algorithm.\n</p>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p>\nFigure 3 depicts the overall methodology (detailed in <a href=\"https://catalog.caida.org/details/paper/2015_mapping_peering_interconnections\"><span class=\"italic\">Mapping Peering Interconnections to a Facility</span></a>, \n2015) and datasets used by the interconnection-to-facility inference process.\nIn the first step, we extract the following information from a public data\nsource (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.peeringdb.com/\">PeeringDB</a> database): a\nlist of interconnection facilities, their locations, and AS membership at \neach of these facilities. We complement geographic information available from \nPeeringDB with coordinate and population data from the\n<a href=\"http://www.geonames.org/\">Geoname</a> geolocation database.\nWe use CAIDA's <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/as-organizations/\">\nAS-to-Organization dataset</a> to find which ASes administratively \nbelong to the same organization. \nFinally, we cull a list of prefixes belonging to the ASes in the \nPeeringDB data using AS-to-prefix mapping inferred from CAIDA's \n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/as-relationships/\">AS Relationships</a> \ndata set. </p>\n<p>\nThe second step requires conducting (or using archived) traceroute \nprobing specifically targeting IP \naddresses belonging to the prefixes identified in the first step.\nWe map each observed IP interface to an AS using CAIDA's AS Rank's\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/as-relationships/\">prefix-to-AS map</a>.\nWe also perform alias resolution, i.e., collapse IP interfaces into routers,\nwith CAIDA's <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/midar/\">MIDAR\n</a> tool, and assign AS ownership to the inferred routers.\nThe alias resolution process increases the accuracy of our\nIP-to-AS mappings, and provides additional constraints for mapping \ninterfaces to facilities. \n\n\nFinally, this topology data, combined with the inferred\nmapping of ASes and IXPs to candidate facilities, becomes an input \ninto our iterative Constraint Facilities Search algorithm that \nprogressively narrows down the possible set of facility locations\nof a given interconnection relationship.\n</p>\n<h2>Format</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThis AS-to Facilities dataset was derived using measurement data collected in\nMarch-April 2017.

The addresses in the alias set are then\ngiven one per line. All addresses in an alias set were tested and confirmed (multiple times)\nto share a counter with each other (in a full mesh).\n\n\nFile: asn-to-facilities.txt\n      AS-to-Facilities co-location\n\nThe file contains the map of Autonomous Systems (ASes) to co-location\nfacilities. To develop this map we parse two datasets, PeeringDB (PDB) and\nCloudScene (CLS) to extract the existing facilities and the ASes that are\npresent in each facility (facility members). \n\nCombining these two datasets is non-trivial due to the lack of standardization\nin the identification of facilities. Typically, for each facility both\ndatabases include three main attributes: the facility name, the facility\noperator and the address of of the facility. Since both the name of the\nfacility, and the name of the facility operator are not standardized, we first\nattempt to create a mapping between the PDB and CLS facilities based on the\naddress. When the two datasets indicate the same postcode and country for a\nfacility, we map the two records together and we merge their respective lists\nof members. Although this approach works well when the address of a facility\nis accurately recorded, in many cases the postcode formats differ, the postcode\nmay be missing altogether, or a wrong postcode may be recorded. Indeed, the\nrecords in both datasets are manually maintained which can lead in\n\"fat-finger\" errors or incomplete address information. \n\nTo improve the mapping of facility records to the same physical location we\nfeed the provided addresses to the Google Maps Geocoding (GMG) API, which\nreturns the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). The benefit of\nusing the GMG API is the ability to handle different formats of human-readable\naddresses and flag errors in the provided addresses.\n\nIn some cases a building may host multiple facilities, therefore we may end up\nwith many-to-many mappings between PDB and CLS facilities for the same address.\nIn such cases, in order to create a one-to-one mapping we calculate the\nsimilarity of the organization and facilities names using the Levenshtein\ndistance and we select the PDB and CLS facility with the lowest distance.\n\nAfter identifying which facilities correspond to the same physical location we\nneed to merge the corresponding members. Again, this step is complicated by the\nfact that CloudScene provides only the organization names of each member but\nnot their corresponding AS numbers (ASNs) which are their unique identifiers.\nTo map organizations to ASNs, we extract the organization names from WHOIS\nrecords and PDB. When an organization has multiple sibling ASNs, we consider\nall of the siblings co-located in the same facilities. \n\n"}],

Firstly, AS relationships determine routing policies that\nintroduce a non-trivial set of constraints to paths over which\nInternet traffic can flow. This has implications for network     \nrobustness, traffic engineering, macroscopic topology measurement\nstrategies, and other research and operational considerations.\nSecondly, macroscopic analysis of AS relationships not only yields\ninsight into the economic underpinnings of business realities in the\ncurrent Internet, it also provides a solid validation framework for \neconomy-based modeling of Internet topology evolution. Indeed, the\nInternet AS-level topology and its evolutionary dynamics are\nconsequences of business decisions that Internet players make.\nTherefore, the ability to infer AS relationships is a promising\ntool for understanding and modeling the economic forces\nthat drive the evolution of the Internet topology and its hierarchy.    \n\n<div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<!--\n<div align=\"center\">\n<font face=\"Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif\" size=\"+1\"><b>\n      |\n      <span>&nbsp; </span><a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/request_user_info_forms/as_relationships\">Download&nbsp;AS&nbsp;Relationships&nbsp;Dataset</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span><a href=\"https://asrank.caida.org/\">AS&nbsp;Rank</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n      |\n      </b></font>\n</div>\n-->\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>\n\nThe Internet is composed of thousands of ISPs that operate individual\nparts of the Internet infrastructure.

ISP A at the top is a provider to B and C and a customer\n\tof no one.\n      </p>\n</div>\n<p>\n      Although business agreements between ISPs can be complicated, the original\n      model introduced by Gao <a href=\"#ref_GAO\"><sup>1</sup></a> abstracts\n    business relationships into the following three most common types: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>customer-to-provider (<em>c2p</em>) (or if looked at from the opposite direction, provider-to-customer <em>p2c</em>),</li>\n<li>peer-to-peer (<em>p2p</em>), and</li>\n<li>sibling-to-sibling (<em>s2s</em>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n      The justification for this classification is that an AS must buy\n      transit services for any traffic destined to parts of the Internet\n      that this AS neither owns nor can reach through its customers. In\n      Figure 1, arrow directions reflect flows of money -- ASes at\n      lower levels are <em>customers</em> who\n      pay ISPs (<em>providers</em>) at higher levels in exchange for\n      access to the rest of the Internet, also known as <em>transit</em>.\n      We refer to links between a customer and a provider as <b><em>\n      c2p</em> (<em>p2c</em>) links</b>.\n      In Figure 1, D-&gt;B, E-&gt;B, F-&gt;C, B-&gt;A, and C-&gt;A are\n      c2p links.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A <b><em>p2p</em> link</b> connects two ISPs who have\n      agreed to exchange traffic on a quid pro quo basis. Peers should exchange\n      traffic only between each other and each other's customers. Peering\n      allows growing ISPs to save money on transit costs they would\n      otherwise have to pay to deliver traffic to/from their customers.\n      In Figure 2, B-C is a p2p link, unidirectional since\n      neither B nor C pays the other for the traffic they exchange.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      An <b><em>s2s</em> link</b> connects two ASes\n      with a common administrative boundary.  Such links usually\n      appear as a result of mergers and acquisitions, or under certain\n      network management scenarios.\n    </p>\n<div style=\"width:530px;\" class=\"float-right asrank-image\">\n<img src=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/as-relationships/images/valid-invalid-paths.png\" width=\"530\" height=\"277\" alt=\"Examples of paths through a graph of ASes.\"><p>\n<b>figure 2.</b> The top two paths 1 and 2 are valid, while the bottom two\n\t  3 and 4 are invalid.\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tWe use the notion of money transfers between ASes to define\n\t<em>valid</em> and <em>invalid</em>\n\tAS paths. A <b>valid path</b> between source\n\tand destination ASes is one in which for <em>every</em>\n\tISP providing transit (a transit provider), there exists a customer\n\timmediately adjacent to the ISP in the AS path.\n\tAn <b>invalid path</b> has at least one transit provider\n\tnot paid by a neighbor in the path.\n      </p>\n<p>\n\tIn figure 2 the top two examples are valid paths, while the bottom\n\ttwo are invalid. In Example 1 the transit providers are A, B, and\n\tC. ISPs B and C pay to A, D pays to B, and F pays to C. In Example\n\t2 the transit providers are B and C, and they are paid by D and F,\n\trespectively. In contrast, in Example 3 the transit provider is B,\n\tbut not only does no one pay B, but B itself pays both A and Z.\n\tExample 4 also illustrates a situation where nobody pays transit\n\tprovider B.\n      </p>\n<p>\n\tIn other words, a valid path must have the following <em>\n\tvalid path pattern</em>: zero or more c2p links,\n\tfollowed by zero or one p2p link, followed by zero or more p2c\n\tlinks. In addition, s2s links can appear in any number anywhere in\n\tthe path.\n      </p>\n<h3>History of inference algorithms</h3>\n<p>\n\tGao's<a href=\"#ref_GAO\"><sup>1</sup></a> pioneering work\n\tinspired many researchers to seek\n\tapproaches to inferring ISP business relationships using information\n\tfrom publicly available BGP routing tables. Gao used the concept\n\tof valid paths as the basis for her inference heuristic and identified\n\tthe \"top\" provider in a given path based on AS degree (the number of\n\tASes with observed connectivity to a given AS).\n      </p>\n<p>\n\tSubramanian <em>et al.</em><a href=\"#ref_SARK\"><sup>2</sup></a>\n\tprovided a more elegant mathematical formulation based on the\n\tconcept of valid paths, but they simplified the problem by not\n\tinferring s2s links. Using maximization of valid paths as an objective,\n\tthey formulated the AS relationship inference problem as a\n\tcombinatorial optimization problem: given an undirected\n\tgraph <em>G</em> derived from a set of BGP paths\n\t<em>P</em>, assign the edge type (c2p or p2p)\n\tto every edge in <em>G</em> such that the total\n\tnumber of valid paths in <em>P</em> is maximized.\n\tThey called the problem the <b>type-of-relationship (ToR) problem</b>,\n\tconjectured that it is NP-complete, and provided a heuristic solution.\n      </p>\n<p>\n\tDi Battista <em>et al.</em><a href=\"#ref_DPP\"><sup>3</sup></a> and independently\n\tErlebach <em>et al.</em><a href=\"#ref_EHS\"><sup>4</sup></a> proved that the\n\tToR problem is indeed NP-complete. The latter proved also that it is even\n\tharder, APX-complete. More importantly for practical purposes, both\n\tstudies demonstrated that p2p links <em>cannot</em>\n\tbe inferred in the ToR problem formulation, and they developed mathematically\n\trigorous approximate solutions to the ToR problem but inferred\n\tonly c2p and p2c links.  No technique thus far reliably identifies\n\tp2p links.\n      </p>\n<p>\n\tDimitropoulos, <em>et al.</em><a href=\"#ref_DKH1\"><sup>6</sup></a>\n\tidentified still other issues with the ToR formulation, like the random\n\tbreaking of ties which can yield obviously incorrect inferences,\n\te.g., well-known large providers are inferred as customers\n\tof small ASes. In the first paper<a href=\"#ref_DKH1\"><sup>6</sup></a>\n\twe handled this issue with multiobjective optimization techniques\n\tthat incorporated AS degree into the inference. In a subsequent\n\tpaper<a href=\"#ref_DKH2\"><sup>7</sup></a> we introduced improved\n\talgorithms that determine not only c2p but also p2p links (for\n\tthose we can detect from BGP data). These improvements achieved\n\tmore accurate AS relationship inferences,\n\twhich we demonstrate against ground truth for a set of ASes.\n\tBenjamin Hummel and Sven Kosub\n\t<a href=\"#ref_BS\"><sup>8</sup></a> introduced the idea that\n\tthe resulting graph should be acyclic, i.e. should contain no cycles,\n\tand presented a new algorithm that does the assignment and reduces\n\tthe number of cycles.  Our current technique creates no cycles,\n\tbut at the cost of \"valid\" (valley-free) paths in the graph.\n\tM. Luckie et al.<a href=\"#ref_ACV\"><sup>9</sup></a> dropped the\n\tvalley-free assumption and instead\n\trelied on three assumptions about the Internet's inter-domain structure:\n\t(1) an AS enters into a provider relationship to become globally reachable;\n\tand (2) there exists a peering clique of ASes at the top of the hierarchy,\n\tand (3) there is no cycle of p2c links.\n      </p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"customer-cone\">Customer Cone</a>\n</h3>\n<p>\n      One metric of the resulting AS relationship graph that allows comparison\n      across ASes is the <b>customer cone</b> -- the set of ASes, IPv4\n      prefixes, or IPv4 addresses that can be\n      reached from a given AS following only customer links.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Looking specifically at the <b>AS customer cone</b>,\n      we define an AS <i>A</i>'s <b>AS customer cone</b>\n      as the AS <i>A</i> itself plus all the ASes that can be reached\n      from <i>A</i> following only p2c links <b>in BGP paths we observed</b>.\n      In other words, <i>A</i>'s customer cone contains <i>A</i>, plus <i>A</i>'s\n      customers, plus its customers' customers, and so on.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Each AS announces a set of IPv4 prefixes.  Each IPv4 prefix represents a\n      set of contiguous IPv4 addresses which are routed as a unit.  Prefixes can\n      be nested, with the most specific prefix used for routing over less\n      specific prefixes.  To find the set of prefixes which are reachable in\n      AS <i>A</i>'s <b>IPv4 prefix customer cone</b> create the union of prefixe\n      announced by all ASes found in AS <i>A</i>'s <b>AS customer cone</b>.\n      AS <i>A</i>'s <b>IPv4 address customer cone</b> is the set of addresses\n      covered by AS <i>A</i>'s <b>IPv4 prefix customer cone</b>.\n      Prefixes overlap, which represent a set of IPv4 addresses.\n    </p>\n<p>\n\tThe size of the\n\tcustomer cone of an AS reflects the number of other elements (ASes,\n\tIPv4 prefixes, or IPv4 addresses) found in it's set.  An AS in the customer\n\tcone is assumed to pay, directly or indirectly, for transit, and provides a\n\tcoarse metric of the size or influence of an AS in the routing system.\n      </p>\n<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"float-right asrank-image\">\n<img style=\"width:200px\" src=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/as-relationships/images/customer-cones.png\"><a name=\"fig3\"><b>figure 3.</b>  This graph shows the respective cone sizes for each AS in the graph.</a>\n</div>\n<p>figure 3 depicts several AS customer cones, ASes <b>D, E, F\n\t</b>, and <b>I</b> all sit at the bottom of the hierarchy\n\tand so only have a single AS in their cone. <b>H</b> ranks\n\ta little bit higher with 2 ASes.  Both <b>C</b> and <b>B</b>\n\ttie with 3 ASes.  Note that <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> both have\n\t<b>E</b> in their respective cones.  <b>A</b> is ranked at the top\n\tof the hierarchy with 6 ASes in its customer cone.\n      </p>\n<p>\n\tASes with large customer cones play an important role\n\tin the Internet's capital and governance structure. At the top of\n\tthis hierarchy are ISPs commonly known as Tier-1 ISPs, which\n\tdo not pay for transit to upstream providers at all; instead they\n\tpeer with each other to provide connectivity to all\n\tdestinations in the Internet. At the bottom of the hierarchy are\n\tcustomer ASes who do not have their own customers and pay\n\tproviders to reach all destinations in the Internet.\n      </p>\n<p>\n\tWe define <b>peering cone size ratio</b> as the ratio in\n\tcustomer cone sizes of a pair of ASes if they (hypothetically) peered.\n\tSimilar customer cone sizes will have this ratio closer to 100,\n\talso an indication the ASes have more incentive to peer.\n\tThe closer this ratio is to zero, the larger the difference in\n\tcustomer cone sizes, and the less incentive the larger provider\n      will have to peer with the smaller.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf a given link (AS relationship) is currently a customer link\n\tand changes to a peering link, then the provider-turned-peer's customer\n\tcone will likely shrink, because the cone will lose any customer ASes\n\tthat the given AS used to access through that customer-turned-peer.\n\tThe customer-turned-peer's cone size will not change since the\n\tprovider-turned-peer is not included in the customer cone.\n\tTo compare magnitude of differences, the <b> peering cone size ratio</b>\n\talways uses the larger customer cone as the denominator.\n\tFor example, for AS pair S and N, with customer cone sizes\n\tC(S) and C(N), respectively , if C'(S) and C'(N) were\n\ttheir respective customer cone sizes if S and N became\n\tp2p peers (with other links unchanged),\n\tthen the <b>peering cone size ratio </b> is C'(N)/C'(S)\n\tif C'(S) &gt; C'(N), otherwise C'(S)/C'(N).\n      </p>\n<div style=\"width:600px;\" class=\"float-right asrank-image\">\n<img style=\"width:600px\" src=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/as-relationships/images/customer-to-peer.png\"><span style=\"font-size:-1\"><b> figure 4. </b>\n\t  shows the effect on customer cones of changing the relationship of <b>A</b> to <b>B</b>\n\t  from its current one to a peering relationship.\n\t  </span>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tfigure 4 illustrates how different relationships affect the customer cone sizes\n\tof AS <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>.

Each file contains a\nfull AS graph derived from RouteViews BGP table snapshots taken at\n8-hour intervals over a 5-day period.  The AS relationships available\nare customer-provider (and provider-customer in the opposite\ndirection), peer-to-peer, and sibling-to-sibling.  See the comments at\nthe beginning of each file for details of the file format.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n<div style=\"margin-left:2em;margin-right:10em\">\n    The general serial-1 procedure for creating a file is as follows:\n    <ol>\n<li> Extract all AS links from RouteViews snapshots.</li>\n<li> Infer customer-provider relationships, and annotate AS links.</li>\n<li> Infer peer-to-peer relationships, and annotate AS links, possibly\n\t overriding customer-provider relationships inferred in step 2.</li>\n<li> Heuristically fix suspicious looking inferred relationships\n\t (e.g., a low-degree AS acting as provider to a high-degree AS).</li>\n<li> Infer sibling ASes (that is, ASes belonging to the same organization)\n\t from WHOIS, and annotate AS links, possibly overriding previous\n\t relationship annotations.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p>\n\nSerial-2 Data is available from October 2015 to the present, with one file\ncreated per week.

The ownership inferences           \nare based on IP-to-AS mapping derived from public BGP data, list of             \npeering prefixes from PeeringDB, and the previously inferred business AS        \nrelationships. Then we convert the observed IP path into an AS path             \nusing the router ownership information (rather than mapping each                \nobserved IP to AS directly) and retain the first AS link in the                 \nresulting path for the AS graph.  \n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nLinks discovered in this way are assumed to be peering links, since\ncustomer provider links are normally visible in the Routeviews BGP tables.\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:2em;margin-right:10em\">\n    The general serial-2 procedure for creating a file is as follows:\n    <ol>\n<li> Collect BGP communites from IX looking glass servers.</li>\n<li> Infer peering links between pairs of AS which accept routes from\n\t each other.</li>\n<li> Collect archived BGP data from Routeviews and RIPE RIS.</li>\n<li> Infer peering links at points in the obsered AS paths that cross an \n\t known IX.</li>\n<li> Collect traceroutes from ark monitors.</li>\n<li> Convert the IP path to AS path using inferred ownership and\n\t keep the first AS link in the path.</li>\n<li> Merge all newly inferred links to the serial-1 graph as peering\n\t links</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p>\n<a name=\"annotatedlinkspapers\">\nFor details of the algorithms used to infer AS relationships, see the\nfollowing papers:</a>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://catalog.caida.org/details/paper/2006_as_relationships_inference/\">AS Relationships: Inference and Validation</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://catalog.caida.org/details/paper/2005_asrelationships/\">Inferring AS Relationships: Dead End or Lively Beginning?</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://catalog.caida.org/details/paper/2013_inferring_multilateral_peering/\">Inferring Multilateral Peering</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://catalog.caida.org/details/paper/2013_asrank/\">AS Relationships, Customer Cones, and Validation</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://catalog.caida.org/details/paper/2014_inferring_complex_as_relationships/\">Inferring Complex AS Relationships</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://catalog.caida.org/details/paper/2015_ipv6_as_relationships/\">IPv6 AS Relationships, Cliques, and Congruence</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>\n\nFor more information, email topology-info@caida.org.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n<h3>Acceptable Use Agreement</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Access to these data is subject to the terms of the following CAIDA Acceptabl\ne Use Agreement</b>\n(<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/about/legal/aua/caida_pub_aua.pdf\">printable version</a> in PDF format\n)<br>\n<textarea xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\" rows=\"20\" cols=\"100%\" readonly style=\"background-color:#eee;border:thin solid black;\">\nCAIDA ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT for PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE DATASETS\n\nThe following terms comprise the Acceptable Use Policy and Data License Agreement for all publicly accessible datasets (the \"Public Agreement\") made available by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), a research unit at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and governed by The Regents of the University of California.\n\nLICENSE\n\nCAIDA's authorization to access the data grants You a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, and terminable license to copy, modify, and use the data in accordance with this Public Agreement.

Firstly, AS relationships determine routing policies that\nintroduce a non-trivial set of constraints to paths over which\nInternet traffic can flow. This has implications for network     \nrobustness, traffic engineering, macroscopic topology measurement\nstrategies, and other research and operational considerations.\nSecondly, macroscopic analysis of AS relationships not only yields\ninsight into the economic underpinnings of business realities in the\ncurrent Internet, it also provides a solid validation framework for \neconomy-based modeling of Internet topology evolution. Indeed, the\nInternet AS-level topology and its evolutionary dynamics are\nconsequences of business decisions that Internet players make.\nTherefore, the ability to infer AS relationships is a promising\ntool for understanding and modeling the economic forces\nthat drive the evolution of the Internet topology and its hierarchy.    \n\n<div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<!--\n<div align=\"center\">\n<font face=\"Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif\" size=\"+1\"><b>\n      |\n      <span>&nbsp; </span><a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/request_user_info_forms/as_relationships\">Download&nbsp;AS&nbsp;Relationships&nbsp;Dataset</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span><a href=\"https://asrank.caida.org/\">AS&nbsp;Rank</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n      |\n      </b></font>\n</div>\n-->\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>\n\nThe Internet is composed of thousands of ISPs that operate individual\nparts of the Internet infrastructure. ISPs engage in both formal and\ninformal relationships to collectively and ubiquitously route traffic\nin the Internet.

The ASes at the bottom of\n\tthe graph, D, E, and F, are customers of those above. ISPs in\n\tthe middle, B and C, are both providers of ASes below and\n\tcustomers of ISPs above. ISPs B and C are also peers of each\n\tother. ISP A at the top is a provider to B and C and a customer\n\tof no one.\n      </p>\n</div>\n<p>\n      Although business agreements between ISPs can be complicated, the original\n      model introduced by Gao <a href=\"#ref_GAO\"><sup>1</sup></a> abstracts\n    business relationships into the following three most common types: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>customer-to-provider (<em>c2p</em>) (or if looked at from the opposite direction, provider-to-customer <em>p2c</em>),</li>\n<li>peer-to-peer (<em>p2p</em>), and</li>\n<li>sibling-to-sibling (<em>s2s</em>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n      The justification for this classification is that an AS must buy\n      transit services for any traffic destined to parts of the Internet\n      that this AS neither owns nor can reach through its customers. In\n      Figure 1, arrow directions reflect flows of money -- ASes at\n      lower levels are <em>customers</em> who\n      pay ISPs (<em>providers</em>) at higher levels in exchange for\n      access to the rest of the Internet, also known as <em>transit</em>.\n      We refer to links between a customer and a provider as <b><em>\n      c2p</em> (<em>p2c</em>) links</b>.\n      In Figure 1, D-&gt;B, E-&gt;B, F-&gt;C, B-&gt;A, and C-&gt;A are\n      c2p links.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A <b><em>p2p</em> link</b> connects two ISPs who have\n      agreed to exchange traffic on a quid pro quo basis. Peers should exchange\n      traffic only between each other and each other's customers. Peering\n      allows growing ISPs to save money on transit costs they would\n      otherwise have to pay to deliver traffic to/from their customers.\n      In Figure 2, B-C is a p2p link, unidirectional since\n      neither B nor C pays the other for the traffic they exchange.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      An <b><em>s2s</em> link</b> connects two ASes\n      with a common administrative boundary.  Such links usually\n      appear as a result of mergers and acquisitions, or under certain\n      network management scenarios.\n    </p>\n<div style=\"width:530px;\" class=\"float-right asrank-image\">\n<img src=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/as-relationships/images/valid-invalid-paths.png\" width=\"530\" height=\"277\" alt=\"Examples of paths through a graph of ASes.\"><p>\n<b>figure 2.</b> The top two paths 1 and 2 are valid, while the bottom two\n\t  3 and 4 are invalid.\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tWe use the notion of money transfers between ASes to define\n\t<em>valid</em> and <em>invalid</em>\n\tAS paths. A <b>valid path</b> between source\n\tand destination ASes is one in which for <em>every</em>\n\tISP providing transit (a transit provider), there exists a customer\n\timmediately adjacent to the ISP in the AS path.\n\tAn <b>invalid path</b> has at least one transit provider\n\tnot paid by a neighbor in the path.\n      </p>\n<p>\n\tIn figure 2 the top two examples are valid paths, while the bottom\n\ttwo are invalid. In Example 1 the transit providers are A, B, and\n\tC. ISPs B and C pay to A, D pays to B, and F pays to C. In Example\n\t2 the transit providers are B and C, and they are paid by D and F,\n\trespectively. In contrast, in Example 3 the transit provider is B,\n\tbut not only does no one pay B, but B itself pays both A and Z.\n\tExample 4 also illustrates a situation where nobody pays transit\n\tprovider B.\n      </p>\n<p>\n\tIn other words, a valid path must have the following <em>\n\tvalid path pattern</em>: zero or more c2p links,\n\tfollowed by zero or one p2p link, followed by zero or more p2c\n\tlinks. In addition, s2s links can appear in any number anywhere in\n\tthe path.\n      </p>\n<h3>History of inference algorithms</h3>\n<p>\n\tGao's<a href=\"#ref_GAO\"><sup>1</sup></a> pioneering work\n\tinspired many researchers to seek\n\tapproaches to inferring ISP business relationships using information\n\tfrom publicly available BGP routing tables. Gao used the concept\n\tof valid paths as the basis for her inference heuristic and identified\n\tthe \"top\" provider in a given path based on AS degree (the number of\n\tASes with observed connectivity to a given AS).\n      </p>\n<p>\n\tSubramanian <em>et al.</em><a href=\"#ref_SARK\"><sup>2</sup></a>\n\tprovided a more elegant mathematical formulation based on the\n\tconcept of valid paths, but they simplified the problem by not\n\tinferring s2s links. Using maximization of valid paths as an objective,\n\tthey formulated the AS relationship inference problem as a\n\tcombinatorial optimization problem: given an undirected\n\tgraph <em>G</em> derived from a set of BGP paths\n\t<em>P</em>, assign the edge type (c2p or p2p)\n\tto every edge in <em>G</em> such that the total\n\tnumber of valid paths in <em>P</em> is maximized.\n\tThey called the problem the <b>type-of-relationship (ToR) problem</b>,\n\tconjectured that it is NP-complete, and provided a heuristic solution.\n      </p>\n<p>\n\tDi Battista <em>et al.</em><a href=\"#ref_DPP\"><sup>3</sup></a> and independently\n\tErlebach <em>et al.</em><a href=\"#ref_EHS\"><sup>4</sup></a> proved that the\n\tToR problem is indeed NP-complete. The latter proved also that it is even\n\tharder, APX-complete. More importantly for practical purposes, both\n\tstudies demonstrated that p2p links <em>cannot</em>\n\tbe inferred in the ToR problem formulation, and they developed mathematically\n\trigorous approximate solutions to the ToR problem but inferred\n\tonly c2p and p2c links.  No technique thus far reliably identifies\n\tp2p links.\n      </p>\n<p>\n\tDimitropoulos, <em>et al.</em><a href=\"#ref_DKH1\"><sup>6</sup></a>\n\tidentified still other issues with the ToR formulation, like the random\n\tbreaking of ties which can yield obviously incorrect inferences,\n\te.g., well-known large providers are inferred as customers\n\tof small ASes. In the first paper<a href=\"#ref_DKH1\"><sup>6</sup></a>\n\twe handled this issue with multiobjective optimization techniques\n\tthat incorporated AS degree into the inference. In a subsequent\n\tpaper<a href=\"#ref_DKH2\"><sup>7</sup></a> we introduced improved\n\talgorithms that determine not only c2p but also p2p links (for\n\tthose we can detect from BGP data). These improvements achieved\n\tmore accurate AS relationship inferences,\n\twhich we demonstrate against ground truth for a set of ASes.\n\tBenjamin Hummel and Sven Kosub\n\t<a href=\"#ref_BS\"><sup>8</sup></a> introduced the idea that\n\tthe resulting graph should be acyclic, i.e. should contain no cycles,\n\tand presented a new algorithm that does the assignment and reduces\n\tthe number of cycles.  Our current technique creates no cycles,\n\tbut at the cost of \"valid\" (valley-free) paths in the graph.\n\tM. Luckie et al.<a href=\"#ref_ACV\"><sup>9</sup></a> dropped the\n\tvalley-free assumption and instead\n\trelied on three assumptions about the Internet's inter-domain structure:\n\t(1) an AS enters into a provider relationship to become globally reachable;\n\tand (2) there exists a peering clique of ASes at the top of the hierarchy,\n\tand (3) there is no cycle of p2c links.\n      </p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"customer-cone\">Customer Cone</a>\n</h3>\n<p>\n      One metric of the resulting AS relationship graph that allows comparison\n      across ASes is the <b>customer cone</b> -- the set of ASes, IPv4\n      prefixes, or IPv4 addresses that can be\n      reached from a given AS following only customer links.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Looking specifically at the <b>AS customer cone</b>,\n      we define an AS <i>A</i>'s <b>AS customer cone</b>\n      as the AS <i>A</i> itself plus all the ASes that can be reached\n      from <i>A</i> following only p2c links <b>in BGP paths we observed</b>.\n      In other words, <i>A</i>'s customer cone contains <i>A</i>, plus <i>A</i>'s\n      customers, plus its customers' customers, and so on.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Each AS announces a set of IPv4 prefixes.  Each IPv4 prefix represents a\n      set of contiguous IPv4 addresses which are routed as a unit.  Prefixes can\n      be nested, with the most specific prefix used for routing over less\n      specific prefixes.  To find the set of prefixes which are reachable in\n      AS <i>A</i>'s <b>IPv4 prefix customer cone</b> create the union of prefixe\n      announced by all ASes found in AS <i>A</i>'s <b>AS customer cone</b>.\n      AS <i>A</i>'s <b>IPv4 address customer cone</b> is the set of addresses\n      covered by AS <i>A</i>'s <b>IPv4 prefix customer cone</b>.\n      Prefixes overlap, which represent a set of IPv4 addresses.\n    </p>\n<p>\n\tThe size of the\n\tcustomer cone of an AS reflects the number of other elements (ASes,\n\tIPv4 prefixes, or IPv4 addresses) found in it's set.  An AS in the customer\n\tcone is assumed to pay, directly or indirectly, for transit, and provides a\n\tcoarse metric of the size or influence of an AS in the routing system.\n      </p>\n<div style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"float-right asrank-image\">\n<img style=\"width:200px\" src=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/as-relationships/images/customer-cones.png\"><a name=\"fig3\"><b>figure 3.</b>  This graph shows the respective cone sizes for each AS in the graph.</a>\n</div>\n<p>figure 3 depicts several AS customer cones, ASes <b>D, E, F\n\t</b>, and <b>I</b> all sit at the bottom of the hierarchy\n\tand so only have a single AS in their cone. <b>H</b> ranks\n\ta little bit higher with 2 ASes.  Both <b>C</b> and <b>B</b>\n\ttie with 3 ASes.  Note that <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> both have\n\t<b>E</b> in their respective cones.  <b>A</b> is ranked at the top\n\tof the hierarchy with 6 ASes in its customer cone.\n      </p>\n<p>\n\tASes with large customer cones play an important role\n\tin the Internet's capital and governance structure. At the top of\n\tthis hierarchy are ISPs commonly known as Tier-1 ISPs, which\n\tdo not pay for transit to upstream providers at all; instead they\n\tpeer with each other to provide connectivity to all\n\tdestinations in the Internet. At the bottom of the hierarchy are\n\tcustomer ASes who do not have their own customers and pay\n\tproviders to reach all destinations in the Internet.\n      </p>\n<p>\n\tWe define <b>peering cone size ratio</b> as the ratio in\n\tcustomer cone sizes of a pair of ASes if they (hypothetically) peered.\n\tSimilar customer cone sizes will have this ratio closer to 100,\n\talso an indication the ASes have more incentive to peer.\n\tThe closer this ratio is to zero, the larger the difference in\n\tcustomer cone sizes, and the less incentive the larger provider\n      will have to peer with the smaller.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf a given link (AS relationship) is currently a customer link\n\tand changes to a peering link, then the provider-turned-peer's customer\n\tcone will likely shrink, because the cone will lose any customer ASes\n\tthat the given AS used to access through that customer-turned-peer.\n\tThe customer-turned-peer's cone size will not change since the\n\tprovider-turned-peer is not included in the customer cone.\n\tTo compare magnitude of differences, the <b> peering cone size ratio</b>\n\talways uses the larger customer cone as the denominator.\n\tFor example, for AS pair S and N, with customer cone sizes\n\tC(S) and C(N), respectively , if C'(S) and C'(N) were\n\ttheir respective customer cone sizes if S and N became\n\tp2p peers (with other links unchanged),\n\tthen the <b>peering cone size ratio </b> is C'(N)/C'(S)\n\tif C'(S) &gt; C'(N), otherwise C'(S)/C'(N).\n      </p>\n<div style=\"width:600px;\" class=\"float-right asrank-image\">\n<img style=\"width:600px\" src=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/as-relationships/images/customer-to-peer.png\"><span style=\"font-size:-1\"><b> figure 4. </b>\n\t  shows the effect on customer cones of changing the relationship of <b>A</b> to <b>B</b>\n\t  from its current one to a peering relationship.\n\t  </span>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tfigure 4 illustrates how different relationships affect the customer cone sizes\n\tof AS <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>.

Our method infers all\n    interdomain links directly connected to and visible from the\n    network hosting a single VP. Accurately inferring the parties\n    involved in all interdomain links observed in traceroute requires\n    overcoming the natural sample bias in traceroute, i.e., poorer\n    visibility into distant networks, which limits our ability to\n    assemble constraints. The <i>bdrmap</i> process builds on years\n    of prior work in topology discovery, alias resolution, AS relationship\n    inference, and active probing systems.\n  </p>\n<h3>Methodology</h3>\n<p>\n    The <i>bdrmap</i> approach begins with assembling routing and\n    addressing data used to inform data collection and analysis. In\n    particular, we use the following input datasets:\n\n    <ul>\n<li>Prefix-AS mappings constructed from public BGP data (routing\n      table snapshots from <a href=\"http://www.routeviews.org\">RouteViews</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ripe.net/\">RIPE RIS</a> projects). We also\n      used CAIDA's <a href=\"https://asrank.caida.org/\">AS-rank</a> algorithm to infer AS relationships for the\n      same BGP data.</li>\n<li>Public datasets supplied by the five Regional Internet\n      Registries (RIRs) that report address blocks they have delegated\n      to networks.</li>\n<li>A list of IXP prefixes from database snapshots provided by\n      the <a href=\"https://www.peeringdb.com/\">PeeringDB</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pch.net/\">Packet Clearing House (PCH)</a>\n      projects.</li>\n<li>A list of sibling ASes of the network hosting our\n      measurement VP. We seeded our manual inference with CAIDA's public\n      <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/as-organizations/\">AS-to-organization</a>\n      mapping, and then manually added missing siblings and removed\n      spurious siblings.</li>\n</ul>\n      \n    Then, we deploy an efficient variant of traceroute to trace the\n    path from each VP to every routed prefix observed in the global\n    BGP routing system. We apply alias resolution techniques to infer\n    routers and point-to-point links used for interdomain\n    interconnection. We use this collected data to assemble\n    constraints that guide our execution of heuristics to infer router\n    ownership. We developed a specialized measurement utility that we\n    call <i>bdrmap</i> to drive data collection and infer border\n    routers. The goal of <i>bdrmap</i> is to obtain as much\n    information available about the links observed from a given\n    network toward every other network, in order to constrain our\n    subsequent border router inferences.  We implemented <i>bdrmap</i>\n    as a driver to <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/scamper/\">scamper</a>,\n    a parallelized measurement system that efficiently gathers raw\n    traceroute and alias resolution data.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    The entire border mapping methodology including data collection\n    and analysis phases is described in the paper, \"<a href=\"https://catalog.caida.org/details/paper/2016_bdrmap/\">bdrmap: Inference of\n    Borders Between IP Networks</a>, M.

The first field is a\n  set of IPs representing a router owned by the network hosting the VP.\n  Subsequent fields represent other routers connected to the border router\n  owned by the VP network.

The first field is a\nset of IPs representing a router owned by the network hosting the VP.\nSubsequent fields represent other routers connected to the border router\nowned by the VP network. Each subsequent field consists of the AS number\nof the neighbor network operating the attached router, and the set of IP\naddresses inferred to be on that router.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nCAIDA's border mapping tool, bdrmap tackles the problem of automatically and\ncorrectly inferring network boundaries in traceroute. bdrmap focuses on the\nnetwork boundaries for we have the most confidence that we can accurately infer\nthem in the presence of sampling bias: interdomain links attached to the network\nlaunching the traceroute. Our method infers all interdomain links directly\nconnected to and visible from the network hosting a single VP. Accurately\ninferring the parties involved in all interdomain links observed in traceroute\nrequires overcoming the natural sample bias in traceroute, i.e., poorer\nvisibility into distant networks, which limits our ability to assemble\nconstraints. The bdrmap process builds on years of prior work in topology\ndiscovery, alias resolution, AS relationship inference, and active probing\nsystems.\n\nMethodology\n-----------\n\nThe bdrmap approach begins with assembling routing and addressing data used to\ninform data collection and analysis. In particular, we use the following input\ndatasets:\n\nPrefix-AS mappings constructed from public BGP data (routing table snapshots\nfrom RouteViews and RIPE RIS projects. We also used CAIDA's AS-rank algorithm\nto infer AS relationships for the same BGP data.\n\nPublic datasets supplied by the five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) that\nreport address blocks they have delegated to networks.\n\nA list of IXP prefixes from database snapshots provided by the PeeringDB and\nPacket Clearing House (PCH) projects.\n\nA list of sibling ASes of the network hosting our measurement VP. We seeded our\nmanual inference with CAIDA's publicAS-to-organization mapping, and then\nmanually added missing siblings and removed spurious siblings.\n\nThen, we deploy an efficient variant of traceroute to trace the path from each\nVP to every routed prefix observed in the global BGP routing system. We apply\nalias resolution techniques to infer routers and point-to-point links used for\ninterdomain interconnection. We use this collected data to assemble constraints\nthat guide our execution of heuristics to infer router ownership. We developed\na specialized measurement utility that we call bdrmap to drive data collection\nand infer border routers. The goal of bdrmap is to obtain as much information\navailable about the links observed from a given network toward every other\nnetwork, in order to constrain our subsequent border router inferences.  We\nimplemented bdrmap as a driver toscamper, a parallelized measurement system\nthat efficiently gathers raw traceroute and alias resolution data.\n\nThe entire border mapping methodology including data collection and analysis\nphases is described in the paper, \"bdrmap: Inference of Borders Between IP\nNetworks, M. Luckie, A. Dhamdhere. B. Huffaker, D. Clark, K. Claffy,\nACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) 2016.\n\n"}],

The attribute is represented by an X:Y pair, where X and Y are two \n16-bit values (extended communities use four octets). By convention, the first\ntwo octets encode the Autonomous System Number (ASN) of the operator\nthat sets the community. The next two octets encode an arbitrary\nvalue to denote some property relevant to routing policy. Unfortunately,\nthe specific values and semantics of this BGP attribute are not standardized.\nAlso, the community is a transitive optional attribute, meaning that BGP\nimplementations do not have to recognize this attribute. It is at the\nnetwork operator's discretion to accept it or pass it on to another AS.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis BGP Community Dictionary Dataset focuses on Location-Encoding Ingress\nCommunities which label the location where the prefix entered the network.\nThe Dictionary represents our best effort to extract meaningful geolocation\ninformation encoded by network operators into the Community attributes\nthey set up for their networks. \t\n\n</p>\n<p>\nOperator choose their own schemes to describe ingress location information\nat various granularities. Many publish their community schemes either\nin their Internet Routing Registry (IRR) records or in their support Web\npages. The documentation is in natural text and lacks a standardized\nstructure and terminology; parsing it requiring significant manual work.\nTo tackle this problem, we developed a web-mining tool that enables\nautomatic compilation of a community dictionary. The tool uses a web\nscraper to extract text from the remarks sections of IRR records and\nfrom ASes's web pages. Next, a text parser analyzes the extracted text\nusing the Natural Language ToolKit to discover infrastructure-related\ncommunities. We identify sub-strings that include community values using\nregular expression matching and use <a href=\"http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html\">Stanford's Named Entity \nRecognizer</a> (NER) to identify named entities, focusing on entities that\npertain to locations or infrastructure operators.\n</p>\n<p>\n\nThe BGP Community Dictionary can be used as a source of meta-data to \ninterpret/annotate other BGP data, including for inferring topological and \ngeographic locations of outages.

We can filter out the\nlegitimate traffic so the resulting data provides us with a snapshot\nof anomalous 'background' traffic to 1/256th of all public IPv4\ndestination addresses on the Internet.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe packets seen by the network telescope result from a wide range\nof events, including misconfiguration (e.g. mistyping an IP address),\nscanning of address space by attackers or malware looking for\nvulnerable targets, backscatter from randomly spoofed source\ndenial-of-service attacks, and the automated spread of malware.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis dataset contains data from darkspace observations in the first\nsix months of 2012. The data has been preprocessed with the\n<a href=\"https://catalog.caida.org/details/software/corsaro/\">Corsaro Software Suite</a>.\nThe data is split into files that each contain one hour of data.\nFor each hour we provide one file with flow information in the Corsaro \nFlowTuple\nformat, and one file containing the source type analysis in the Corsaro\nSmee\nformat. Note that the corresponding FlowType and Smee Corsaro plugins are required\nto read the files. The total size of this dataset is 2.1 TB.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe destination network addresses have been masked by zeroing the              \nfirst eight bits of the IP address. Source addresses have been anonymized\nusing Cryptopan anonymization with a single key.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe research described in the paper\n<a href=\"https://catalog.caida.org/details/paper/2013_day_after_patch_tuesday/\">\n\"The Day After Patch Tuesday: Effects Observable in IP Darkspace Traffic\"</a>\nby T. Zseby <i>et al.</i> was based on the data in this dataset.\n</p>\n<p>\nFilenames are in the form:\n</p>\n<pre>\n- FlowTuple data \n        Filenames:  [YYYYMMDDHHMM]_[epoch time].flowtuple\n- Smee source type analysis \n        Filenames:  [YYYYMMDDHHMM]_[epoch time].smee\n</pre>\n<p>\nThe unprocessed, anonymized pcap traces for this dataset can in principle be\nmade available on request, provided convincing arguments are given for\nneeding them (the pcap files will consume about 20 TB of storage capacity!!).\nPcap files can be read with any software that reads the pcap (tcpdump) format,\nincluding the \n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\">CoralReef Software Suite</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org\">tcpdump</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">Wireshark</a>,\nand many others.\n</p>\n<h3>\nCaveats that apply to this dataset:\n</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\nThis dataset and the types of worm and denial-of-service attack\ntraffic contained therein are representative only of some spoofed\nsource denial-of-service attacks. Many denial-of-service attackers\ndo not spoof source IP addresses when they attack their victim, in\nwhich case backscatter would not appear on a telescope.  Attackers\ncan also spoof in a non-random fashion, which will incur an uneven\ndistribution of backscatter across the IPv4 address space, including\nany telescope lenses.  The telescope does not currently send any\npackets in response, which also limits insight into the traffic\nit sees.\n\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Acceptable Use Agreement</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Access to these data is subject to the terms of the following CAIDA Acceptabl\ne Use Agreement</b>\n(<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/about/legal/aua/caida_pub_aua.pdf\">printable version</a> in PDF format\n)<br>\n<textarea xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\" rows=\"20\" cols=\"100%\" readonly style=\"background-color:#eee;border:thin solid black;\">\nCAIDA ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT for PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE DATASETS\n\nThe following terms comprise the Acceptable Use Policy and Data License Agreement for all publicly accessible datasets (the \"Public Agreement\") made available by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), a research unit at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and governed by The Regents of the University of California.\n\nLICENSE\n\nCAIDA's authorization to access the data grants You a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, and terminable license to copy, modify, and use the data in accordance with this Public Agreement.

DNS RTTs are influenced by\nseveral factors, including remote server loading, congestion within\nInternet routes, route changes, and local effects such as link or\nequipment failures.\n\nDomain nameservers such as BIND use various algorithms to select which of the\n13 root or gTLD servers they will ask to resolve a top-level domain name.  By\nwatching requests to root/gTLD at the boundary of a campus (i.e. large\nenterprise) network, and the responses to them, one can make passive\nmeasurements of the RTT to all of the root/gTLD servers which the site has\nroutes to.\n\nThis data was collected using NeTraMet,\n   https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/netramet/index\nproducing daily data files in NeTraMet's 'flow data file' format, \nfrom several different sites.  The data available covers the \nfollowing periods:\n\n  UC San Diego (UCSD)  from  8 Jan 2002  to   9 Aug 2003\n  U Colorado (CU)      from  8 Jan 2003  to   4 Apr 2008\n  WIDE (U Tokyo)       from  1 Jun 2004  to  27 Sep 2009\n  WIDE (U Fujisawa)    from 13 Jul 2005  to  15 Jun 2009\n\n  U Auckland (UA)      from 11 Nov 2002  to   5 Jan 2012\n                   and from 19 Mar 2014  to   present\n\nIt was collected at five-minute intervals using an SRL (RFC 2723)\nruleset called 'dns-root.srl' (available with the data).\n\nA web page allowing you to examine 5-minute median RTT values over\nperiods of 1 to 7 days appears at:\n  https://www.caida.org/cgi-bin/dns_perf/main.pl\n\nThe NeTraMet flow data file layout is described in\n  www2.auckland.ac.nz/net/Accounting/ntmref.pdf\n\nFlow data files contain 2 types of lines: \n  - control record lines, these start with a '#' (pound-sign).\n  - flow data records \n\nEach file begins with a header giving details of when the\nfile was created, and the format of its data records.  The\nformat is described by a '#Format' record, listing the RTFM attributes\nrequested in the dns-root ruleset.\n\nIn this dataset, the NeTraMet meters were read every five minutes; flow data\nfor each five-minute interval appears between '#Time' and '#Enddata'\nrecords in the files.\n\nThe data was collected using NeTraMet's ToTurnaround attribute,\ni.e. each flow record contains an RTT distribution for one\nroot or gTLD, as described in\n   https://www.caida.org/outreach/papers/2002/nsrtd/\n\nIf there are less than 100 (later 120) data points, their\nactual values are saved in the flow data record.  Otherwise the\ndata is binned, using bounds generated from the data.  This\napproach preserves the maximum accuracy for the RTT values.\n\nNeTraMet versions 51b4 (21 Sep 04) through 51b6 (15 Mar 05)\nhad a bug in its handling of 'dynamic' distributions.\n\nIf such a distribution had 120 or less data values, the distribution\nis written in the flow data file as a type 5 distribution, i.e.\na list of actual values.  These are correct.\n\nHowever, if there were more than 120 values, NeTraMet computes\nlower and upper limits, and uses them to produce a 'binned'\ndistribution, type 6.  The values are bin counts, those counts\nare correct.  Unfortunately, the bug corrupted the computed\nupper limit, producing distributions which always had an upper\nlimit of 7000 (700 ms).  To produce actual values for the bin\nupper edges, one needs correct limit values - these are incorrect,\nand should NOT be used.  The (corrupted) type 6 distributions\nremain in the .dif files, they have not been removed.\n\nThe affected date ranges are:\n\n       UC San Diego             not affected\n       Auckland and Colorado:   Mon 15 Sep 04 through Wed 16 Mar 05\n       Tokyo and Fujisawa:      Mon 15 Sep 04 through Wed  9 Nov 05\n\nThe Auckland and Colorado data doesn't have very many type 6\ndistributions, so this isn't too much of a problem.\nFor the WIDE data (Tokyo and Fujisawa), the root distributions seem \nmostly unaffected, but the gTLD distributions have very high counts \nper 5-minute reading interval, so there is almost no usable gTLD RTT \ndata from the WIDE NeTraMet meter while the buggy version(s) were running.\n\nA sample perl program, dnsroot_to_dat.pl, is provided to demonstrate\none approach to extracting RTT distributions from the flow data files.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA DNS root/gTLD RTT Dataset,\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/dns_root_gtld_rtt_dataset\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n    Support for the DNS root/gTLD RTT Dataset is provided by\n    CAIDA, WIDE, the University of Colorado and the University of Auckland.\n\n\nSponsors\n--------\n\nThanks to:\n * The University of Auckland, for their support in developing\n   early versions of NeTraMet and the standards effort leading up\n   to the RTFM system.\n * CAIDA for their ongoing support of NeTraMet development, making\n   it a more versatile research tool.\n * The WAND group at Waikato University for support in making NeTraMet work\n   with early versions DAG cards.\n * Endace Technologies for support with newer versions of DAG cards.\n\nSpecial thanks (mostly for their help in setting up and maintaining \n  the NeTraMet meters) to :\n * U Auckland (Russell Fulton) \n * CAIDA (Duane Wessels, Dan Andersen)\n * U Colorado (Robert Roybal)\n * WIDE (Yuji Sekiya, Kenjiro Cho)\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nFor more information on NeTraMet, see:\n  https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/netramet/\n\n"}],

Although public and commercial geolocation services are often used for this purpose, their accuracy when applied to network infrastructure has not been previously assessed. Prior work focused on evaluating the overall accuracy of geolocation databases, which is dominated by their performance on end-user IP addresses. In this work, we evaluate the reliability of router geolocation in databases. We use a dataset of about 1.64M router interface IP addresses extracted from the CAIDA Ark dataset to examine the country- and city-level coverage and consistency of popular public and commercial geolocation databases. We also create and provide a ground-truth dataset of 16,586 router interface addresses and locations, with city-level accuracy, and we use it to evaluate the databases&rsquo; accuracy with a regional breakdown analysis. Our results show that the databases are not reliable for geolocating routers and that there is room to improve their country- and city-level accuracy. Based on our results, we present a set of recommendations to researchers concerning using the geolocation databases to geolocate routers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"keywordlist\">\t    \n            Keywords: active data analysis, measurement methodology, topology\t  </div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear:both; height: 2em;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}, {"name": "README.txt", "format": "text", "content": "------------------------\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\nWhen referencing this data (as required by the AUA), please reference the\nassociated paper::\n\n    Manaf Gharaibeh, Han Zhang, Anant Shah, Roya Ensa , Bradley Huffaker, Christos Papadopoulos\n    in: Proc.

An IXP can be distributed and\nlocated in numerous data centers (aka facilities), and a single facility can\ncontain mutliple IXPs. Each IXP has a prefix, or collection of prefixes, which\nare used by companies/ASes to address machines within the IXP infrastructure. \nAn AS connected to a given IXP is known as a member of that IXP. Internet\ntraffic exchange through an IXP makes use of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) \nthat recognizes ISPs and CDNs by their Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs).  \n</p>\n<h2>Sources of Data</h2>\n<p></p>\n<paragraph>\nIn order to make the most complete list of IXPs we combined information \navailable from the following sources:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://peeringdb.com/\">PeeringDB</a>(<b>PDB</b>)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://bgp.he.net/report/exchanges\">Hurricane Electric</a> (<b>HE</b>) </li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://prefix.pch.net/applications/ixpdir/menu_download.php\">Packet Clearing House</a> (<b>PCH</b>)</li>\n</ul>\nTo exclude outdated entries, we selected only PDB entries with the \"ok\" status,\nPCH entries with the \"active\" status, and HE entries with active URLs.\n\n</paragraph>\n<p>\nWe also used <a href=\"http://www.geonames.org/\">GeoNames</a> data \n(<a href=\"http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/readme.txt\">readme</a>,<a href=\"http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/\">download</a>)\nto derive relevant geographic information.  \t\n</p>\n<h2>Methodology</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFirst, we downloaded the GeoNames data\nset and created a local sqlite database of geographic coordinates indexed on the\nname, asciiname, and alternative names of cities and villages. If we could not\nfind a match between the name of the city where a certain IXP is located and \nany of the location strings in the database, we assigned negative geo_ids to \nthose IXPs.\n</p>\n<p>\nNext, we tried to identify the cases when IXPs listed in the different data \nsources are in fact the same. This is a non-trivial task since IXPs names, \ncities and addresses could be (and are) spelled differently. We first merged \nIXPs found in different sources which have the same set of prefixes. For the\nremaining IXPs, we calculated the Levenshtein distance between the IXPs names.\nIXPs with the names more than 4 characters long and for which the\ndistance was less than 2, not determined by the first or last characters of \neach string, were assumed to be identical. For example, the Levenshtein \ndistance between \"Equinix S&agrave;o Paulo\" and \"Equinix Sao Paulo\" is 1 \n(one character is different in those names); therefore, we decide that\nboth designate the same IXP. The names \"BIX\" and \"CIX\" are also off by one\ncharacter, but they are only 3 characters long, and thus we treat them as\nreferring to two different IXPs. Finally, \"FICIX2\" and \"FICIX3\" are long \nenough and also have only one character difference, but it is the last \ncharacter of each string, and we conclude that the \"2\" and \"3\" indicate\ndifferent IXPs. \n</p>\n<p>\nAlthough many IXPs are distributed across multiple facilities, only PDB\ndatabase provides detailed location information about multiple facilities for\nindividual IXPs. We use the PDB information directly to create facility \nrecords with all their geographic fields (street address, zipcode, city, state,\ncountry, and region) populated. In contrast, both PCH and HE include only a \nsingle facility location for each IXP in their database, and typically localize\nit only at the city level accuracy. Thus, we create a facility placeholder \nrecord from PCH and HE data using the most specific geographic data these \ndatabases provide. To populate geographic fields for an IXP record, we assign a\nspecific value to a given field only if this value is the same in all facilities\nor facility placeholder records for this IXP.\n</p>\n<h2>Format</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAll files are in <span class=\" bold\">JSONL</span> (JSON Lines)\nformat with comment lines starting with '#' and all other lines containing a\nsingle object in JSON format. JSONL can be converted  to JSON with \njsonl_to_json.py tool. All files begin\nwith a commented meta data line showing when the file was produced.\n</p>\n<p>\nFile <span class=\" bold\">ixs.jsonl</span> contains information about individual IXPs.

This trace contains anonymized packet headers in pcap format on a single direction of the bidirectional OC192 link at equinix-chicago from approximately 2008-03-19 19:00 to 20:00 UTC. The hardware monitoring the other direction of the link was not functioning properly at the time of the traffic capture, so only data for a single direction was captured.<br>\n<br>\nFor the <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a>  monitor, the first monthly bidirectional traffic\ntrace was taken on April 30 2008, and added to the Anonymized 2008 Internet\nTrace dataset in June 2008. This one-hour trace resulted in 83 GB of compressed\npcap files. The first monthly bidirectional traffic trace from the\n<i>equinix-sanjose</i> monitor was taken on July 17 2008.\n<br>\nStarting with the 2014 dataset the yearly passive trace datasets only contain\none trace per quarter (previous years contain one trace per month). While we still\ncollect a one-hour trace each month (and add statistics about each trace to\nthe <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/trace_stats/\">trace statistics</a> page),\nwe are forced by storage limitations to select only one of the three traces for\neach quarter for inclusion in this yearly collection.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nTraffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. The anonymization key changes annually and is the same for all traces recorded during the same calendar year.  \nDuring capture packets are truncated at a snap length selected to avoid excessive packet loss due to disk I/O overload. The snap length has historically varied from 64 to 96 bytes. In addition, payload is removed from all packets: only header information upto layer 4 (transport layer) remains.\n<br>\nThe Endace network cards used to record these traces provide timestamps with nanosecond\nprecision. However, the anonymized traces are stored in pcap format with timestamps\ntruncated to microseconds. Starting with the 2010 traces the original nanosecond timestamps are provided as separate ascii files alongside the pcap files.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe traces can be read with any software that reads the pcap (tcpdump)\nformat, including the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\">CoralReef Software Suite</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org\">tcpdump</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">Wireshark</a>,\nand many others.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe are aware that 2008 data contains more then trivial amounts\nof packet loss; this has especially been an issue for <i>equinix-chicago</i>\ndirection B. Due to the way the monitoring equipment is set up the\nsynchronization between directions we don't know how well-aligned both\ndirections of a single link are. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe related  <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_ipv6day_and_ipv6launch_dataset\"><b>IPv6 Day and World IPv6 Launch Day</b></a> Dataset contains  three anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitors on high-speed Internet backbone links taken during IPv6 Day on 8 June 2011,\nand three additional traces from the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitor taken during IPv6 Launch Day on 6 June 2012 (the Chicago monitors were\noffline on IPv6 Launch Day).\n The traces cover start, middle and end of the 24-hour IPv6 Day and IPv6 Launch Day\nperiods. The first IPv6 Day trace runs from 7 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n8 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC, the second trace from on 8 June 2011 13:00:00 UTC to\n14:00:00 UTC and the final trace runs from 8 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n9 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC. The three traces on IPv6 Launch Day run from\n5 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to 6 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, from 6 June 2012 13:00:00 UTC\nto 6 June 2012 14:00:00 UTC, and from 6 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to\n7 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, respectively.\n Traffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. All traces in this dataset are anonymized with the same key.\nIn addition, the payload has been removed from all packets.\nThe dataset size is 194 GB, 172 GB and 198 GB for each of the three IPv6 Day\ntraces, respectively.

Currently this dataset contains traffic from the\n'equinix-chicago' OC192 monitors, starting with a 1 hour trace on March 19 2008\nfor a single direction of a bidirectional OC192 link.  This trace was taken as\npart of the Day in the Life of the Internet (DITL) 2008 measurement event.\nThis dataset has monthly traces from monitors on OC192 links, starting\nfrom April 2008. See the 'Trace details' section for more information on\nindividual monthly traces.\n\nStarting April 2008 monthly traces were taken on the 'equinix-chicago' monitor.\nStarting July 2008 monthly traces were taken on the 'equinix-sanjose' monitor.\n\nDataset Contents\n----------------\n    - trace files (*.pcap.gz): compressed pcap (tcpdump) format traces\n    - md5 files (*.pcap.gz.md5): md5 checksum of the trace\n    - stats files (*.pcap.stats): statistics on the trace, produced by crl_stats\n      (part of the CoralReef suite of tools).\n\nCreation process\n----------------\n\nRaw traces were taken on Endace DAG cards with 'dagconvert' (part of Endace dagtools):\n\n  dagconvert -s SNAPLEN -v -V -d DAG_DEVICE -t DURATION -r 2g -T dag:erf -o RAW_TRACE\n\nRaw traces were stripped of payload with:\n  crl_to_dag -l4 -Cipfilter='1=1' -o STRIPPED_TRACE RAW_TRACE\n\nPayload-stripped traces were anonymized and split in 1-minute chunks with:\n  crl_to_pcap -r -Canon=KEYFILE -Cai -Ci=60 -o ANON_TRACE STRIPPED_TRACE \n\nThis resulted in pcap files that only include layer 3 (IPv4 and IPv6) and layer 4\n(eg. TCP,UDP,ICMP) headers, with no packet payload.\n\nTraces are named using the following format: {monitor}.{direction}.{start-time}.anon.pcap.gz\n\n     * monitor: eq-chic / eq-snjc\n     * direction: dirA / dirB\n     * start-time: time trace began, format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss.UTC\n\nMD5 checksums were kept with the trace files, and files were checked against\nthese checksums whenever data was transferred between physical media.\n\nAt different stages of the traffic capturing process packet loss can occur, at the end of\nthis README we try to summarize the different types of losses we detected during various\nstages.\n\nWe are aware that some data in the Anonymized 2008 Internet traces dataset\ncontains more then trivial amounts of packet loss; this has especially been an issue\nfor equinix-chicago direction B (dirB). Please see the 'Metadata' section for\nmore detailed information on packet loss.\n    \nDue to the way the monitoring equipment is set up to do time-synchronization \nwe don't know how well-aligned timestamps between directions of a single link are.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA UCSD Anonymized Internet Traces - [dates used],\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n    Support for CAIDA's Internet Traces is provided by the National Science\n    Foundation, the US Department of Homeland Security, and\n    CAIDA Members.\n\n\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nThe equinix-chicago OC192 monitor setup:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\n\nThe Day in the Life of the Internet project:\n    https://www.caida.org/projects/ditl/\n\nThe CoralReef Software Suite:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\n\nMetadata\n--------\n\nThis section provides some more detailed information on various traces, specifically\non packet loss.\npkts_captured:       Total number of packets that was captured by hardware\npkts_lost_hw:        Number of packets the capturing hardware reported to have\n   lost.

This trace contains anonymized packet headers in pcap format on a single direction of the bidirectional OC192 link at equinix-chicago from approximately 2008-03-19 19:00 to 20:00 UTC. The hardware monitoring the other direction of the link was not functioning properly at the time of the traffic capture, so only data for a single direction was captured.<br>\n<br>\nFor the <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a>  monitor, the first monthly bidirectional traffic\ntrace was taken on April 30 2008, and added to the Anonymized 2008 Internet\nTrace dataset in June 2008. This one-hour trace resulted in 83 GB of compressed\npcap files. The first monthly bidirectional traffic trace from the\n<i>equinix-sanjose</i> monitor was taken on July 17 2008.\n<br>\nStarting with the 2014 dataset the yearly passive trace datasets only contain\none trace per quarter (previous years contain one trace per month). While we still\ncollect a one-hour trace each month (and add statistics about each trace to\nthe <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/trace_stats/\">trace statistics</a> page),\nwe are forced by storage limitations to select only one of the three traces for\neach quarter for inclusion in this yearly collection.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nTraffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. The anonymization key changes annually and is the same for all traces recorded during the same calendar year.  \nDuring capture packets are truncated at a snap length selected to avoid excessive packet loss due to disk I/O overload. The snap length has historically varied from 64 to 96 bytes. In addition, payload is removed from all packets: only header information upto layer 4 (transport layer) remains.\n<br>\nThe Endace network cards used to record these traces provide timestamps with nanosecond\nprecision. However, the anonymized traces are stored in pcap format with timestamps\ntruncated to microseconds. Starting with the 2010 traces the original nanosecond timestamps are provided as separate ascii files alongside the pcap files.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe traces can be read with any software that reads the pcap (tcpdump)\nformat, including the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\">CoralReef Software Suite</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org\">tcpdump</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">Wireshark</a>,\nand many others.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe are aware that 2008 data contains more then trivial amounts\nof packet loss; this has especially been an issue for <i>equinix-chicago</i>\ndirection B. Due to the way the monitoring equipment is set up the\nsynchronization between directions we don't know how well-aligned both\ndirections of a single link are. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe related  <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_ipv6day_and_ipv6launch_dataset\"><b>IPv6 Day and World IPv6 Launch Day</b></a> Dataset contains  three anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitors on high-speed Internet backbone links taken during IPv6 Day on 8 June 2011,\nand three additional traces from the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitor taken during IPv6 Launch Day on 6 June 2012 (the Chicago monitors were\noffline on IPv6 Launch Day).\n The traces cover start, middle and end of the 24-hour IPv6 Day and IPv6 Launch Day\nperiods. The first IPv6 Day trace runs from 7 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n8 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC, the second trace from on 8 June 2011 13:00:00 UTC to\n14:00:00 UTC and the final trace runs from 8 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n9 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC. The three traces on IPv6 Launch Day run from\n5 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to 6 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, from 6 June 2012 13:00:00 UTC\nto 6 June 2012 14:00:00 UTC, and from 6 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to\n7 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, respectively.\n Traffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. All traces in this dataset are anonymized with the same key.\nIn addition, the payload has been removed from all packets.\nThe dataset size is 194 GB, 172 GB and 198 GB for each of the three IPv6 Day\ntraces, respectively. The IPv6 Launch Day sizes are 177 GB, 121 GB and 171 GB.\n</p>\n<h3>Acceptable Use Agreement</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Access to these data is subject to the terms of the following CAIDA Acceptable Use Agreement</b>\n(<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/about/legal/aua/caida_aua.pdf\">printable version</a> in PDF format)<br>\n<textarea xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\" rows=\"20\" cols=\"100%\" readonly style=\"background-color:#eee;border:thin solid black;\">\nCAIDA ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT\n(ver 071814)\n\nThe following terms comprise the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Data License Agreement\n(collectively, the \"AGREEMENT\", or, \"Acceptable Use Agreement (AUA)\" for all datasets made\navailable to You by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), a research unit\nat the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and governed by The Regents of the University\nof California.

This dataset contains traffic traces from the 'equinix-chicago' and\n'equinix-sanjose' OC192 monitors.\n\nDataset Contents\n----------------\n    - trace files (*.pcap.gz): compressed pcap (tcpdump) format traces\n    - md5 files (*.pcap.gz.md5): md5 checksum of the trace\n    - stats files (*.pcap.stats): statistics on the trace, produced by crl_stats\n      (part of the CoralReef suite of tools).\n\nCreation process\n----------------\n\nRaw traces were taken on Endace DAG cards with 'dagconvert' (part of Endace dagtools):\n\n  dagconvert -s SNAPLEN -v -V -d DAG_DEVICE -t DURATION -r 2g -T dag:erf -o RAW_TRACE\n\nRaw traces were stripped of payload with:\n  crl_to_dag -l4 -Cipfilter='1=1' -o STRIPPED_TRACE RAW_TRACE\n\nPayload-stripped traces were anonymized and split in 1-minute chunks with:\n  crl_to_pcap -r -Canon=KEYFILE -Cai -Ci=60 -o ANON_TRACE STRIPPED_TRACE \n\nThis resulted in pcap files that only include layer 3 (IPv4 and IPv6) and layer 4\n(eg. TCP,UDP,ICMP) headers, with no packet payload.\n\nTraces are named using the following format: {monitor}.{direction}.{start-time}.anon.pcap.gz\n\n     * monitor: equinix-chicago / equinix-sanjose\n     * direction: dirA / dirB\n     * start-time: time trace began, format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss.UTC\n\nMD5 checksums were kept with the trace files, and files were checked against\nthese checksums whenever data was transferred between physical media.\n\nAt different stages of the traffic capturing process packet loss can occur, at the end of\nthis README we try to summarize the different types of losses we detected during various\nstages.\n\nDue to the way the monitoring equipment is set up to do time-synchronization \nwe don't know how well-aligned timestamps between directions of a single link are.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA UCSD Anonymized Internet Traces - [dates used],\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n    Support for CAIDA's Internet Traces is provided by the National Science\n    Foundation, the US Department of Homeland Security, and\n    CAIDA Members.\n\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nThe equinix-chicago OC192 monitor setup:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\n\nThe Day in the Life of the Internet project:\n    https://www.caida.org/projects/ditl/\n\nThe CoralReef Software Suite:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\n\n\nMetadata\n--------\n\nThis section provides some more detailed information on various traces, specifically\non packet loss.\npkts_captured:       Total number of packets that was captured by hardware\npkts_lost_hw:        Number of packets the capturing hardware reported to have\n   lost. '>=' indicates that the loss between 2 packets in the traces was more\n   then the loss counter can accomodate (65535 packets).\npkts_lost_stripping: Number of packets removed from traces as result of payload stripping step\npkts_lost_anon:      Number of packets lost from traces as result of anonymization step\n\nNote that these numbers are the packet loss we can measure.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nname:

This trace contains anonymized packet headers in pcap format on a single direction of the bidirectional OC192 link at equinix-chicago from approximately 2008-03-19 19:00 to 20:00 UTC. The hardware monitoring the other direction of the link was not functioning properly at the time of the traffic capture, so only data for a single direction was captured.<br>\n<br>\nFor the <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a>  monitor, the first monthly bidirectional traffic\ntrace was taken on April 30 2008, and added to the Anonymized 2008 Internet\nTrace dataset in June 2008. This one-hour trace resulted in 83 GB of compressed\npcap files. The first monthly bidirectional traffic trace from the\n<i>equinix-sanjose</i> monitor was taken on July 17 2008.\n<br>\nStarting with the 2014 dataset the yearly passive trace datasets only contain\none trace per quarter (previous years contain one trace per month). While we still\ncollect a one-hour trace each month (and add statistics about each trace to\nthe <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/trace_stats/\">trace statistics</a> page),\nwe are forced by storage limitations to select only one of the three traces for\neach quarter for inclusion in this yearly collection.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nTraffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. The anonymization key changes annually and is the same for all traces recorded during the same calendar year.  \nDuring capture packets are truncated at a snap length selected to avoid excessive packet loss due to disk I/O overload. The snap length has historically varied from 64 to 96 bytes. In addition, payload is removed from all packets: only header information upto layer 4 (transport layer) remains.\n<br>\nThe Endace network cards used to record these traces provide timestamps with nanosecond\nprecision. However, the anonymized traces are stored in pcap format with timestamps\ntruncated to microseconds. Starting with the 2010 traces the original nanosecond timestamps are provided as separate ascii files alongside the pcap files.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe traces can be read with any software that reads the pcap (tcpdump)\nformat, including the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\">CoralReef Software Suite</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org\">tcpdump</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">Wireshark</a>,\nand many others.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe are aware that 2008 data contains more then trivial amounts\nof packet loss; this has especially been an issue for <i>equinix-chicago</i>\ndirection B. Due to the way the monitoring equipment is set up the\nsynchronization between directions we don't know how well-aligned both\ndirections of a single link are. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe related  <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_ipv6day_and_ipv6launch_dataset\"><b>IPv6 Day and World IPv6 Launch Day</b></a> Dataset contains  three anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitors on high-speed Internet backbone links taken during IPv6 Day on 8 June 2011,\nand three additional traces from the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitor taken during IPv6 Launch Day on 6 June 2012 (the Chicago monitors were\noffline on IPv6 Launch Day).\n The traces cover start, middle and end of the 24-hour IPv6 Day and IPv6 Launch Day\nperiods. The first IPv6 Day trace runs from 7 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n8 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC, the second trace from on 8 June 2011 13:00:00 UTC to\n14:00:00 UTC and the final trace runs from 8 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n9 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC. The three traces on IPv6 Launch Day run from\n5 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to 6 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, from 6 June 2012 13:00:00 UTC\nto 6 June 2012 14:00:00 UTC, and from 6 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to\n7 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, respectively.\n Traffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. All traces in this dataset are anonymized with the same key.\nIn addition, the payload has been removed from all packets.\nThe dataset size is 194 GB, 172 GB and 198 GB for each of the three IPv6 Day\ntraces, respectively. The IPv6 Launch Day sizes are 177 GB, 121 GB and 171 GB.\n</p>\n<h3>Acceptable Use Agreement</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Access to these data is subject to the terms of the following CAIDA Acceptable Use Agreement</b>\n(<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/about/legal/aua/caida_aua.pdf\">printable version</a> in PDF format)<br>\n<textarea xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\" rows=\"20\" cols=\"100%\" readonly style=\"background-color:#eee;border:thin solid black;\">\nCAIDA ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT\n(ver 071814)\n\nThe following terms comprise the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Data License Agreement\n(collectively, the \"AGREEMENT\", or, \"Acceptable Use Agreement (AUA)\" for all datasets made\navailable to You by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), a research unit\nat the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and governed by The Regents of the University\nof California.

This trace contains anonymized packet headers in pcap format on a single direction of the bidirectional OC192 link at equinix-chicago from approximately 2008-03-19 19:00 to 20:00 UTC. The hardware monitoring the other direction of the link was not functioning properly at the time of the traffic capture, so only data for a single direction was captured.<br>\n<br>\nFor the <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a>  monitor, the first monthly bidirectional traffic\ntrace was taken on April 30 2008, and added to the Anonymized 2008 Internet\nTrace dataset in June 2008. This one-hour trace resulted in 83 GB of compressed\npcap files. The first monthly bidirectional traffic trace from the\n<i>equinix-sanjose</i> monitor was taken on July 17 2008.\n<br>\nStarting with the 2014 dataset the yearly passive trace datasets only contain\none trace per quarter (previous years contain one trace per month). While we still\ncollect a one-hour trace each month (and add statistics about each trace to\nthe <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/trace_stats/\">trace statistics</a> page),\nwe are forced by storage limitations to select only one of the three traces for\neach quarter for inclusion in this yearly collection.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nTraffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. The anonymization key changes annually and is the same for all traces recorded during the same calendar year.  \nDuring capture packets are truncated at a snap length selected to avoid excessive packet loss due to disk I/O overload. The snap length has historically varied from 64 to 96 bytes. In addition, payload is removed from all packets: only header information upto layer 4 (transport layer) remains.\n<br>\nThe Endace network cards used to record these traces provide timestamps with nanosecond\nprecision. However, the anonymized traces are stored in pcap format with timestamps\ntruncated to microseconds. Starting with the 2010 traces the original nanosecond timestamps are provided as separate ascii files alongside the pcap files.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe traces can be read with any software that reads the pcap (tcpdump)\nformat, including the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\">CoralReef Software Suite</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org\">tcpdump</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">Wireshark</a>,\nand many others.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe are aware that 2008 data contains more then trivial amounts\nof packet loss; this has especially been an issue for <i>equinix-chicago</i>\ndirection B. Due to the way the monitoring equipment is set up the\nsynchronization between directions we don't know how well-aligned both\ndirections of a single link are. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe related  <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_ipv6day_and_ipv6launch_dataset\"><b>IPv6 Day and World IPv6 Launch Day</b></a> Dataset contains  three anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitors on high-speed Internet backbone links taken during IPv6 Day on 8 June 2011,\nand three additional traces from the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitor taken during IPv6 Launch Day on 6 June 2012 (the Chicago monitors were\noffline on IPv6 Launch Day).\n The traces cover start, middle and end of the 24-hour IPv6 Day and IPv6 Launch Day\nperiods. The first IPv6 Day trace runs from 7 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n8 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC, the second trace from on 8 June 2011 13:00:00 UTC to\n14:00:00 UTC and the final trace runs from 8 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n9 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC. The three traces on IPv6 Launch Day run from\n5 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to 6 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, from 6 June 2012 13:00:00 UTC\nto 6 June 2012 14:00:00 UTC, and from 6 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to\n7 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, respectively.\n Traffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. All traces in this dataset are anonymized with the same key.\nIn addition, the payload has been removed from all packets.\nThe dataset size is 194 GB, 172 GB and 198 GB for each of the three IPv6 Day\ntraces, respectively. The IPv6 Launch Day sizes are 177 GB, 121 GB and 171 GB.\n</p>\n<h3>Acceptable Use Agreement</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Access to these data is subject to the terms of the following CAIDA Acceptable Use Agreement</b>\n(<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/about/legal/aua/caida_aua.pdf\">printable version</a> in PDF format)<br>\n<textarea xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\" rows=\"20\" cols=\"100%\" readonly style=\"background-color:#eee;border:thin solid black;\">\nCAIDA ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT\n(ver 071814)\n\nThe following terms comprise the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Data License Agreement\n(collectively, the \"AGREEMENT\", or, \"Acceptable Use Agreement (AUA)\" for all datasets made\navailable to You by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), a research unit\nat the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and governed by The Regents of the University\nof California.

This trace contains anonymized packet headers in pcap format on a single direction of the bidirectional OC192 link at equinix-chicago from approximately 2008-03-19 19:00 to 20:00 UTC. The hardware monitoring the other direction of the link was not functioning properly at the time of the traffic capture, so only data for a single direction was captured.<br>\n<br>\nFor the <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a>  monitor, the first monthly bidirectional traffic\ntrace was taken on April 30 2008, and added to the Anonymized 2008 Internet\nTrace dataset in June 2008. This one-hour trace resulted in 83 GB of compressed\npcap files. The first monthly bidirectional traffic trace from the\n<i>equinix-sanjose</i> monitor was taken on July 17 2008.\n<br>\nStarting with the 2014 dataset the yearly passive trace datasets only contain\none trace per quarter (previous years contain one trace per month). While we still\ncollect a one-hour trace each month (and add statistics about each trace to\nthe <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/trace_stats/\">trace statistics</a> page),\nwe are forced by storage limitations to select only one of the three traces for\neach quarter for inclusion in this yearly collection.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nTraffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. The anonymization key changes annually and is the same for all traces recorded during the same calendar year.  \nDuring capture packets are truncated at a snap length selected to avoid excessive packet loss due to disk I/O overload. The snap length has historically varied from 64 to 96 bytes. In addition, payload is removed from all packets: only header information upto layer 4 (transport layer) remains.\n<br>\nThe Endace network cards used to record these traces provide timestamps with nanosecond\nprecision. However, the anonymized traces are stored in pcap format with timestamps\ntruncated to microseconds. Starting with the 2010 traces the original nanosecond timestamps are provided as separate ascii files alongside the pcap files.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe traces can be read with any software that reads the pcap (tcpdump)\nformat, including the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\">CoralReef Software Suite</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org\">tcpdump</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">Wireshark</a>,\nand many others.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe are aware that 2008 data contains more then trivial amounts\nof packet loss; this has especially been an issue for <i>equinix-chicago</i>\ndirection B. Due to the way the monitoring equipment is set up the\nsynchronization between directions we don't know how well-aligned both\ndirections of a single link are. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe related  <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_ipv6day_and_ipv6launch_dataset\"><b>IPv6 Day and World IPv6 Launch Day</b></a> Dataset contains  three anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitors on high-speed Internet backbone links taken during IPv6 Day on 8 June 2011,\nand three additional traces from the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitor taken during IPv6 Launch Day on 6 June 2012 (the Chicago monitors were\noffline on IPv6 Launch Day).\n The traces cover start, middle and end of the 24-hour IPv6 Day and IPv6 Launch Day\nperiods. The first IPv6 Day trace runs from 7 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n8 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC, the second trace from on 8 June 2011 13:00:00 UTC to\n14:00:00 UTC and the final trace runs from 8 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n9 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC. The three traces on IPv6 Launch Day run from\n5 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to 6 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, from 6 June 2012 13:00:00 UTC\nto 6 June 2012 14:00:00 UTC, and from 6 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to\n7 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, respectively.\n Traffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. All traces in this dataset are anonymized with the same key.\nIn addition, the payload has been removed from all packets.\nThe dataset size is 194 GB, 172 GB and 198 GB for each of the three IPv6 Day\ntraces, respectively. The IPv6 Launch Day sizes are 177 GB, 121 GB and 171 GB.\n</p>\n<h3>Acceptable Use Agreement</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Access to these data is subject to the terms of the following CAIDA Acceptable Use Agreement</b>\n(<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/about/legal/aua/caida_aua.pdf\">printable version</a> in PDF format)<br>\n<textarea xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\" rows=\"20\" cols=\"100%\" readonly style=\"background-color:#eee;border:thin solid black;\">\nCAIDA ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT\n(ver 071814)\n\nThe following terms comprise the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Data License Agreement\n(collectively, the \"AGREEMENT\", or, \"Acceptable Use Agreement (AUA)\" for all datasets made\navailable to You by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), a research unit\nat the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and governed by The Regents of the University\nof California.

It contains traffic traces from the 'equinix-chicago' and\n'equinix-sanjose' high-speed monitors.\n\nDataset Contents\n----------------\n    - trace files (*.pcap.gz): compressed pcap (tcpdump) format traces\n    - time files (*.times.gz): contains original nanosecond-precision timestamps.\n         The nanosecond timestamps in each *.times.gz line up exactly with the\n         packets in the corresponding pcap file (containing timestamps truncated\n         to microsecond precision).\n    - stats files (*.pcap.stats): statistics on the trace, produced by crl_stats\n         (part of the CoralReef suite of tools).\n    - file md5.md5: contains md5 checksums for all files\n\nCreation process\n----------------\n\nRaw traces were taken on Endace DAG cards with 'dagconvert' (part of Endace dagtools):\n\n  dagconvert -s SNAPLEN -v -V -d DAG_DEVICE -t DURATION -r 2g -T dag:erf -o RAW_TRACE\n\nRaw traces were stripped of payload with:\n  crl_to_dag -l4 -Cipfilter='1=1' -o STRIPPED_TRACE RAW_TRACE\n\nPayload-stripped traces were anonymized and split in 1-minute chunks with:\n  crl_to_pcap -r -Canon=KEYFILE -Cai -Ci=60 -o ANON_TRACE STRIPPED_TRACE \n\nThis resulted in pcap files that only include layer 3 (IPv4 and IPv6) and layer 4\n(eg. TCP,UDP,ICMP) headers, with no packet payload.\n\nTraces are named using the following format: {monitor}.{direction}.{start-time}.anon.pcap.gz\n\n     * monitor: equinix-chicago / equinix-sanjose\n     * direction: dirA / dirB\n     * start-time: time trace began, format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss.UTC\n\nMD5 checksums were kept with the trace files, and files were checked against\nthese checksums whenever data was transferred between physical media.\n\nAt different stages of the traffic capturing process packet loss can occur, at the end of\nthis README we try to summarize the different types of losses we detected during various\nstages.\n\nDue to the way the monitoring equipment is set up to do time-synchronization \nwe don't know how well-aligned timestamps between directions of a single link are.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA UCSD Anonymized Internet Traces - [dates used],\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n    Support for CAIDA's Internet Traces is provided by the National Science\n    Foundation, the US Department of Homeland Security, and\n    CAIDA Members.\n\n\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nThe equinix-chicago OC192 monitor setup:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\n\nThe Day in the Life of the Internet project:\n    https://www.caida.org/projects/ditl/\n\nThe CoralReef Software Suite:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\n\n\nMetadata\n--------\n\nThis section provides some more detailed information on various traces, specifically\non packet loss.\npkts_captured:       Total number of packets that was captured by hardware\npkts_lost_hw:        Number of packets the capturing hardware reported to have\n   lost. '>=' indicates that the loss between 2 packets in the traces was more\n   then the loss counter can accomodate (65535 packets).\npkts_lost_stripping: Number of packets removed from traces as result of payload stripping step\npkts_lost_anon:      Number of packets lost from traces as result of anonymization step\n\nNote that these numbers are the packet loss we can measure.\n\n---\n\nname:

This trace contains anonymized packet headers in pcap format on a single direction of the bidirectional OC192 link at equinix-chicago from approximately 2008-03-19 19:00 to 20:00 UTC. The hardware monitoring the other direction of the link was not functioning properly at the time of the traffic capture, so only data for a single direction was captured.<br>\n<br>\nFor the <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a>  monitor, the first monthly bidirectional traffic\ntrace was taken on April 30 2008, and added to the Anonymized 2008 Internet\nTrace dataset in June 2008. This one-hour trace resulted in 83 GB of compressed\npcap files. The first monthly bidirectional traffic trace from the\n<i>equinix-sanjose</i> monitor was taken on July 17 2008.\n<br>\nStarting with the 2014 dataset the yearly passive trace datasets only contain\none trace per quarter (previous years contain one trace per month). While we still\ncollect a one-hour trace each month (and add statistics about each trace to\nthe <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/trace_stats/\">trace statistics</a> page),\nwe are forced by storage limitations to select only one of the three traces for\neach quarter for inclusion in this yearly collection.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nTraffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. The anonymization key changes annually and is the same for all traces recorded during the same calendar year.  \nDuring capture packets are truncated at a snap length selected to avoid excessive packet loss due to disk I/O overload. The snap length has historically varied from 64 to 96 bytes. In addition, payload is removed from all packets: only header information upto layer 4 (transport layer) remains.\n<br>\nThe Endace network cards used to record these traces provide timestamps with nanosecond\nprecision. However, the anonymized traces are stored in pcap format with timestamps\ntruncated to microseconds. Starting with the 2010 traces the original nanosecond timestamps are provided as separate ascii files alongside the pcap files.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe traces can be read with any software that reads the pcap (tcpdump)\nformat, including the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\">CoralReef Software Suite</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org\">tcpdump</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">Wireshark</a>,\nand many others.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe are aware that 2008 data contains more then trivial amounts\nof packet loss; this has especially been an issue for <i>equinix-chicago</i>\ndirection B. Due to the way the monitoring equipment is set up the\nsynchronization between directions we don't know how well-aligned both\ndirections of a single link are. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe related  <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_ipv6day_and_ipv6launch_dataset\"><b>IPv6 Day and World IPv6 Launch Day</b></a> Dataset contains  three anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitors on high-speed Internet backbone links taken during IPv6 Day on 8 June 2011,\nand three additional traces from the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitor taken during IPv6 Launch Day on 6 June 2012 (the Chicago monitors were\noffline on IPv6 Launch Day).\n The traces cover start, middle and end of the 24-hour IPv6 Day and IPv6 Launch Day\nperiods. The first IPv6 Day trace runs from 7 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n8 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC, the second trace from on 8 June 2011 13:00:00 UTC to\n14:00:00 UTC and the final trace runs from 8 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n9 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC. The three traces on IPv6 Launch Day run from\n5 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to 6 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, from 6 June 2012 13:00:00 UTC\nto 6 June 2012 14:00:00 UTC, and from 6 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to\n7 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, respectively.\n Traffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. All traces in this dataset are anonymized with the same key.\nIn addition, the payload has been removed from all packets.\nThe dataset size is 194 GB, 172 GB and 198 GB for each of the three IPv6 Day\ntraces, respectively. The IPv6 Launch Day sizes are 177 GB, 121 GB and 171 GB.\n</p>\n<h3>Acceptable Use Agreement</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Access to these data is subject to the terms of the following CAIDA Acceptable Use Agreement</b>\n(<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/about/legal/aua/caida_aua.pdf\">printable version</a> in PDF format)<br>\n<textarea xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\" rows=\"20\" cols=\"100%\" readonly style=\"background-color:#eee;border:thin solid black;\">\nCAIDA ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT\n(ver 071814)\n\nThe following terms comprise the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Data License Agreement\n(collectively, the \"AGREEMENT\", or, \"Acceptable Use Agreement (AUA)\" for all datasets made\navailable to You by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), a research unit\nat the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and governed by The Regents of the University\nof California.

It contains traffic traces from the 'equinix-chicago' and\n'equinix-sanjose' high-speed monitors.\n\nDataset Contents\n----------------\n    - trace files (*.pcap.gz): compressed pcap (tcpdump) format traces\n    - time files (*.times.gz): contains original nanosecond-precision timestamps.\n         The nanosecond timestamps in each *.times.gz line up exactly with the\n         packets in the corresponding pcap file (containing timestamps truncated\n         to microsecond precision).\n    - stats files (*.pcap.stats): statistics on the trace, produced by crl_stats\n         (part of the CoralReef suite of tools).\n    - file md5.md5: contains md5 checksums for all files\n\nCreation process\n----------------\n\nRaw traces were taken on Endace DAG cards with 'dagconvert' (part of Endace dagtools):\n\n  dagconvert -s SNAPLEN -v -V -d DAG_DEVICE -t DURATION -r 2g -T dag:erf -o RAW_TRACE\n\nRaw traces were stripped of payload with:\n  crl_to_dag -l4 -Cipfilter='1=1' -o STRIPPED_TRACE RAW_TRACE\n\nPayload-stripped traces were anonymized and split in 1-minute chunks with:\n  crl_to_pcap -r -Canon=KEYFILE -Cai -Ci=60 -o ANON_TRACE STRIPPED_TRACE \n\nThis resulted in pcap files that only include layer 3 (IPv4 and IPv6) and layer 4\n(eg. TCP,UDP,ICMP) headers, with no packet payload.\n\nTraces are named using the following format: {monitor}.{direction}.{start-time}.anon.pcap.gz\n\n     * monitor: equinix-chicago / equinix-sanjose\n     * direction: dirA / dirB\n     * start-time: time trace began, format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss.UTC\n\nMD5 checksums were kept with the trace files, and files were checked against\nthese checksums whenever data was transferred between physical media.\n\nAt different stages of the traffic capturing process packet loss can occur, at the end of\nthis README we try to summarize the different types of losses we detected during various\nstages.\n\nDue to the way the monitoring equipment is set up to do time-synchronization \nwe don't know how well-aligned timestamps between directions of a single link are.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA UCSD Anonymized Internet Traces - [dates used],\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n    Support for CAIDA's Internet Traces is provided by the National Science\n    Foundation, the US Department of Homeland Security, and\n    CAIDA Members.\n\n\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nThe equinix-chicago OC192 monitor setup:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\n\nThe Day in the Life of the Internet project:\n    https://www.caida.org/projects/ditl/\n\nThe CoralReef Software Suite:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\n\n\nMetadata\n--------\n\nThis section provides some more detailed information on various traces, specifically\non packet loss.\npkts_captured:       Total number of packets that was captured by hardware\npkts_lost_hw:        Number of packets the capturing hardware reported to have\n   lost. '>=' indicates that the loss between 2 packets in the traces was more\n   then the loss counter can accomodate (65535 packets).\npkts_lost_stripping: Number of packets removed from traces as result of payload stripping step\npkts_lost_anon:      Number of packets lost from traces as result of anonymization step\n\nNote that these numbers are the packet loss we can measure.\n\n---\n\nname:

This trace contains anonymized packet headers in pcap format on a single direction of the bidirectional OC192 link at equinix-chicago from approximately 2008-03-19 19:00 to 20:00 UTC. The hardware monitoring the other direction of the link was not functioning properly at the time of the traffic capture, so only data for a single direction was captured.<br>\n<br>\nFor the <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a>  monitor, the first monthly bidirectional traffic\ntrace was taken on April 30 2008, and added to the Anonymized 2008 Internet\nTrace dataset in June 2008. This one-hour trace resulted in 83 GB of compressed\npcap files. The first monthly bidirectional traffic trace from the\n<i>equinix-sanjose</i> monitor was taken on July 17 2008.\n<br>\nStarting with the 2014 dataset the yearly passive trace datasets only contain\none trace per quarter (previous years contain one trace per month). While we still\ncollect a one-hour trace each month (and add statistics about each trace to\nthe <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/trace_stats/\">trace statistics</a> page),\nwe are forced by storage limitations to select only one of the three traces for\neach quarter for inclusion in this yearly collection.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nTraffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. The anonymization key changes annually and is the same for all traces recorded during the same calendar year.  \nDuring capture packets are truncated at a snap length selected to avoid excessive packet loss due to disk I/O overload. The snap length has historically varied from 64 to 96 bytes. In addition, payload is removed from all packets: only header information upto layer 4 (transport layer) remains.\n<br>\nThe Endace network cards used to record these traces provide timestamps with nanosecond\nprecision. However, the anonymized traces are stored in pcap format with timestamps\ntruncated to microseconds. Starting with the 2010 traces the original nanosecond timestamps are provided as separate ascii files alongside the pcap files.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe traces can be read with any software that reads the pcap (tcpdump)\nformat, including the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\">CoralReef Software Suite</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org\">tcpdump</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">Wireshark</a>,\nand many others.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe are aware that 2008 data contains more then trivial amounts\nof packet loss; this has especially been an issue for <i>equinix-chicago</i>\ndirection B. Due to the way the monitoring equipment is set up the\nsynchronization between directions we don't know how well-aligned both\ndirections of a single link are. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe related  <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_ipv6day_and_ipv6launch_dataset\"><b>IPv6 Day and World IPv6 Launch Day</b></a> Dataset contains  three anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitors on high-speed Internet backbone links taken during IPv6 Day on 8 June 2011,\nand three additional traces from the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitor taken during IPv6 Launch Day on 6 June 2012 (the Chicago monitors were\noffline on IPv6 Launch Day).\n The traces cover start, middle and end of the 24-hour IPv6 Day and IPv6 Launch Day\nperiods. The first IPv6 Day trace runs from 7 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n8 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC, the second trace from on 8 June 2011 13:00:00 UTC to\n14:00:00 UTC and the final trace runs from 8 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n9 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC. The three traces on IPv6 Launch Day run from\n5 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to 6 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, from 6 June 2012 13:00:00 UTC\nto 6 June 2012 14:00:00 UTC, and from 6 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to\n7 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, respectively.\n Traffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. All traces in this dataset are anonymized with the same key.\nIn addition, the payload has been removed from all packets.\nThe dataset size is 194 GB, 172 GB and 198 GB for each of the three IPv6 Day\ntraces, respectively. The IPv6 Launch Day sizes are 177 GB, 121 GB and 171 GB.\n</p>\n<h3>Acceptable Use Agreement</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Access to these data is subject to the terms of the following CAIDA Acceptable Use Agreement</b>\n(<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/about/legal/aua/caida_aua.pdf\">printable version</a> in PDF format)<br>\n<textarea xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\" rows=\"20\" cols=\"100%\" readonly style=\"background-color:#eee;border:thin solid black;\">\nCAIDA ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT\n(ver 071814)\n\nThe following terms comprise the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Data License Agreement\n(collectively, the \"AGREEMENT\", or, \"Acceptable Use Agreement (AUA)\" for all datasets made\navailable to You by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), a research unit\nat the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and governed by The Regents of the University\nof California.

It contains traffic traces from the 'equinix-chicago' and\n'equinix-sanjose' high-speed monitors.\n\nNote that, starting with the year 2014, the yearly passive trace datasets\nwill only contain one trace per quarter (previous years contain one trace\nper month). While we still collect a one-hour trace each month (and add\nstatistics about each trace to the trace statistics page), we are forced\nby storage limitations to select only one of the three traces for each\nquarter for inclusion in this yearly collection.\n\nDataset Contents\n----------------\n    - trace files (*.pcap.gz): compressed pcap (tcpdump) format traces\n    - time files (*.times.gz): contains original nanosecond-precision timestamps.\n         The nanosecond timestamps in each *.times.gz line up exactly with the\n         packets in the corresponding pcap file (containing timestamps truncated\n         to microsecond precision).\n    - stats files (*.pcap.stats): statistics on the trace, produced by crl_stats\n         (part of the CoralReef suite of tools).\n    - file md5.md5: contains md5 checksums for all files\n\nCreation process\n----------------\n\nRaw traces were taken on Endace DAG cards with 'dagconvert' (part of Endace dagtools):\n\n  dagconvert -s SNAPLEN -v -V -d DAG_DEVICE -t DURATION -r 2g -T dag:erf -o RAW_TRACE\n\nRaw traces were stripped of payload with:\n  crl_to_dag -l4 -Cipfilter='1=1' -o STRIPPED_TRACE RAW_TRACE\n\nPayload-stripped traces were anonymized and split in 1-minute chunks with:\n  crl_to_pcap -r -Canon=KEYFILE -Cai -Ci=60 -o ANON_TRACE STRIPPED_TRACE \n\nThis resulted in pcap files that only include layer 3 (IPv4 and IPv6) and layer 4\n(eg. TCP,UDP,ICMP) headers, with no packet payload.\n\nTraces are named using the following format: {monitor}.{direction}.{start-time}.anon.pcap.gz\n\n     * monitor: equinix-chicago / equinix-sanjose\n     * direction: dirA / dirB\n     * start-time: time trace began, format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss.UTC\n\nMD5 checksums were kept with the trace files, and files were checked against\nthese checksums whenever data was transferred between physical media.\n\nAt different stages of the traffic capturing process packet loss can occur, at the end of\nthis README we try to summarize the different types of losses we detected during various\nstages.\n\nDue to the way the monitoring equipment is set up to do time-synchronization \nwe don't know how well-aligned timestamps between directions of a single link are.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA UCSD Anonymized Internet Traces - [dates used],\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n    Support for CAIDA's Internet Traces is provided by the National Science\n    Foundation, the US Department of Homeland Security, and\n    CAIDA Members.\n\n\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nThe equinix-chicago OC192 monitor setup:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\n\nThe Day in the Life of the Internet project:\n    https://www.caida.org/projects/ditl/\n\nThe CoralReef Software Suite:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\n\n\nMetadata\n--------\n\nThis section provides some more detailed information on various traces, specifically\non packet loss.\npkts_captured:       Total number of packets that was captured by hardware\npkts_lost_hw:        Number of packets the capturing hardware reported to have\n   lost.

This trace contains anonymized packet headers in pcap format on a single direction of the bidirectional OC192 link at equinix-chicago from approximately 2008-03-19 19:00 to 20:00 UTC. The hardware monitoring the other direction of the link was not functioning properly at the time of the traffic capture, so only data for a single direction was captured.<br>\n<br>\nFor the <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a>  monitor, the first monthly bidirectional traffic\ntrace was taken on April 30 2008, and added to the Anonymized 2008 Internet\nTrace dataset in June 2008. This one-hour trace resulted in 83 GB of compressed\npcap files. The first monthly bidirectional traffic trace from the\n<i>equinix-sanjose</i> monitor was taken on July 17 2008.\n<br>\nStarting with the 2014 dataset the yearly passive trace datasets only contain\none trace per quarter (previous years contain one trace per month). While we still\ncollect a one-hour trace each month (and add statistics about each trace to\nthe <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/trace_stats/\">trace statistics</a> page),\nwe are forced by storage limitations to select only one of the three traces for\neach quarter for inclusion in this yearly collection.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nTraffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. The anonymization key changes annually and is the same for all traces recorded during the same calendar year.  \nDuring capture packets are truncated at a snap length selected to avoid excessive packet loss due to disk I/O overload. The snap length has historically varied from 64 to 96 bytes. In addition, payload is removed from all packets: only header information upto layer 4 (transport layer) remains.\n<br>\nThe Endace network cards used to record these traces provide timestamps with nanosecond\nprecision. However, the anonymized traces are stored in pcap format with timestamps\ntruncated to microseconds. Starting with the 2010 traces the original nanosecond timestamps are provided as separate ascii files alongside the pcap files.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe traces can be read with any software that reads the pcap (tcpdump)\nformat, including the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\">CoralReef Software Suite</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org\">tcpdump</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">Wireshark</a>,\nand many others.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe are aware that 2008 data contains more then trivial amounts\nof packet loss; this has especially been an issue for <i>equinix-chicago</i>\ndirection B. Due to the way the monitoring equipment is set up the\nsynchronization between directions we don't know how well-aligned both\ndirections of a single link are. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe related  <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_ipv6day_and_ipv6launch_dataset\"><b>IPv6 Day and World IPv6 Launch Day</b></a> Dataset contains  three anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitors on high-speed Internet backbone links taken during IPv6 Day on 8 June 2011,\nand three additional traces from the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitor taken during IPv6 Launch Day on 6 June 2012 (the Chicago monitors were\noffline on IPv6 Launch Day).\n The traces cover start, middle and end of the 24-hour IPv6 Day and IPv6 Launch Day\nperiods. The first IPv6 Day trace runs from 7 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n8 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC, the second trace from on 8 June 2011 13:00:00 UTC to\n14:00:00 UTC and the final trace runs from 8 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n9 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC. The three traces on IPv6 Launch Day run from\n5 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to 6 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, from 6 June 2012 13:00:00 UTC\nto 6 June 2012 14:00:00 UTC, and from 6 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to\n7 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, respectively.\n Traffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. All traces in this dataset are anonymized with the same key.\nIn addition, the payload has been removed from all packets.\nThe dataset size is 194 GB, 172 GB and 198 GB for each of the three IPv6 Day\ntraces, respectively.

It contains traffic traces from the 'equinix-chicago'\nhigh-speed monitor.\n\nNote that, starting with the year 2014, the yearly passive trace datasets\nwill only contain one trace per quarter (previous years contain one trace\nper month). While we still collect a one-hour trace each month (and add\nstatistics about each trace to the trace statistics page), we are forced\nby storage limitations to select only one of the three traces for each\nquarter for inclusion in this yearly collection.\n\nDataset Contents\n----------------\n    - trace files (*.pcap.gz): compressed pcap (tcpdump) format traces\n    - time files (*.times.gz): contains original nanosecond-precision timestamps.\n         The nanosecond timestamps in each *.times.gz line up exactly with the\n         packets in the corresponding pcap file (containing timestamps truncated\n         to microsecond precision).\n    - stats files (*.pcap.stats): statistics on the trace, produced by crl_stats\n         (part of the CoralReef suite of tools).\n    - file md5.md5: contains md5 checksums for all files\n\nCreation process\n----------------\n\nRaw traces were taken on Endace DAG cards with 'dagconvert' (part of Endace dagtools):\n\n  dagconvert -s SNAPLEN -v -V -d DAG_DEVICE -t DURATION -r 2g -T dag:erf -o RAW_TRACE\n\nRaw traces were stripped of payload with:\n  crl_to_dag -l4 -Cipfilter='1=1' -o STRIPPED_TRACE RAW_TRACE\n\nPayload-stripped traces were anonymized and split in 1-minute chunks with:\n  crl_to_pcap -r -Canon=KEYFILE -Cai -Ci=60 -o ANON_TRACE STRIPPED_TRACE \n\nThis resulted in pcap files that only include layer 3 (IPv4 and IPv6) and layer 4\n(eg. TCP,UDP,ICMP) headers, with no packet payload.\n\nTraces are named using the following format: {monitor}.{direction}.{start-time}.anon.pcap.gz\n\n     * monitor: equinix-chicago / equinix-sanjose\n     * direction: dirA / dirB\n     * start-time: time trace began, format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss.UTC\n\nMD5 checksums were kept with the trace files, and files were checked against\nthese checksums whenever data was transferred between physical media.\n\nAt different stages of the traffic capturing process packet loss can occur, at the end of\nthis README we try to summarize the different types of losses we detected during various\nstages.\n\nDue to the way the monitoring equipment is set up to do time-synchronization \nwe don't know how well-aligned timestamps between directions of a single link are.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA UCSD Anonymized Internet Traces - [dates used],\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n    Support for CAIDA's Internet Traces is provided by the National Science\n    Foundation, the US Department of Homeland Security, and\n    CAIDA Members.\n\n\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nThe equinix-chicago OC192 monitor setup:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\n\nThe Day in the Life of the Internet project:\n    https://www.caida.org/projects/ditl/\n\nThe CoralReef Software Suite:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\n\n\nMetadata\n--------\n\nThis section provides some more detailed information on various traces, specifically\non packet loss.\npkts_captured:       Total number of packets that was captured by hardware\npkts_lost_hw:        Number of packets the capturing hardware reported to have\n   lost.

This trace contains anonymized packet headers in pcap format on a single direction of the bidirectional OC192 link at equinix-chicago from approximately 2008-03-19 19:00 to 20:00 UTC. The hardware monitoring the other direction of the link was not functioning properly at the time of the traffic capture, so only data for a single direction was captured.<br>\n<br>\nFor the <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a>  monitor, the first monthly bidirectional traffic\ntrace was taken on April 30 2008, and added to the Anonymized 2008 Internet\nTrace dataset in June 2008. This one-hour trace resulted in 83 GB of compressed\npcap files. The first monthly bidirectional traffic trace from the\n<i>equinix-sanjose</i> monitor was taken on July 17 2008.\n<br>\nStarting with the 2014 dataset the yearly passive trace datasets only contain\none trace per quarter (previous years contain one trace per month). While we still\ncollect a one-hour trace each month (and add statistics about each trace to\nthe <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/trace_stats/\">trace statistics</a> page),\nwe are forced by storage limitations to select only one of the three traces for\neach quarter for inclusion in this yearly collection.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nTraffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. The anonymization key changes annually and is the same for all traces recorded during the same calendar year.  \nDuring capture packets are truncated at a snap length selected to avoid excessive packet loss due to disk I/O overload. The snap length has historically varied from 64 to 96 bytes. In addition, payload is removed from all packets: only header information upto layer 4 (transport layer) remains.\n<br>\nThe Endace network cards used to record these traces provide timestamps with nanosecond\nprecision. However, the anonymized traces are stored in pcap format with timestamps\ntruncated to microseconds. Starting with the 2010 traces the original nanosecond timestamps are provided as separate ascii files alongside the pcap files.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe traces can be read with any software that reads the pcap (tcpdump)\nformat, including the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\">CoralReef Software Suite</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org\">tcpdump</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">Wireshark</a>,\nand many others.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe are aware that 2008 data contains more then trivial amounts\nof packet loss; this has especially been an issue for <i>equinix-chicago</i>\ndirection B. Due to the way the monitoring equipment is set up the\nsynchronization between directions we don't know how well-aligned both\ndirections of a single link are. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe related  <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_ipv6day_and_ipv6launch_dataset\"><b>IPv6 Day and World IPv6 Launch Day</b></a> Dataset contains  three anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitors on high-speed Internet backbone links taken during IPv6 Day on 8 June 2011,\nand three additional traces from the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitor taken during IPv6 Launch Day on 6 June 2012 (the Chicago monitors were\noffline on IPv6 Launch Day).\n The traces cover start, middle and end of the 24-hour IPv6 Day and IPv6 Launch Day\nperiods. The first IPv6 Day trace runs from 7 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n8 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC, the second trace from on 8 June 2011 13:00:00 UTC to\n14:00:00 UTC and the final trace runs from 8 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n9 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC. The three traces on IPv6 Launch Day run from\n5 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to 6 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, from 6 June 2012 13:00:00 UTC\nto 6 June 2012 14:00:00 UTC, and from 6 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to\n7 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, respectively.\n Traffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. All traces in this dataset are anonymized with the same key.\nIn addition, the payload has been removed from all packets.\nThe dataset size is 194 GB, 172 GB and 198 GB for each of the three IPv6 Day\ntraces, respectively.

It contains traffic traces from the 'equinix-chicago'\nhigh-speed monitor.\n\nNote that, starting with the year 2014, the yearly passive trace datasets\nwill only contain one trace per quarter (previous years contain one trace\nper month). While we still collect a one-hour trace each month (and add\nstatistics about each trace to the trace statistics page), we are forced\nby storage limitations to select only one of the three traces for each\nquarter for inclusion in this yearly collection.\n\nDataset Contents\n----------------\n    - trace files (*.pcap.gz): compressed pcap (tcpdump) format traces\n    - time files (*.times.gz): contains original nanosecond-precision timestamps\n         The nanosecond timestamps in each *.times.gz line up exactly with the\n         packets in the corresponding pcap file (containing timestamps truncated\n         to microsecond precision).\n    - stats files (*.pcap.stats): statistics on the trace, produced by crl_stats\n         (part of the CoralReef suite of tools).\n    - file md5.md5: contains md5 checksums for all files\n\nCreation process\n----------------\n\nRaw traces were taken on Endace DAG cards with 'dagconvert'\n(part of Endace dagtools):\n\n  dagconvert -s SNAPLEN -v -V -d DAG_DEVICE -t DURATION -r 2g -T dag:erf -o RAW_TRACE\n\nRaw traces were stripped of payload with:\n  crl_to_dag -l4 -Cipfilter='1=1' -o STRIPPED_TRACE RAW_TRACE\n\nPayload-stripped traces were anonymized and split in 1-minute chunks with:\n  crl_to_pcap -r -Canon=KEYFILE -Cai -Ci=60 -o ANON_TRACE STRIPPED_TRACE \n\nThis resulted in pcap files that only include layer 3 (IPv4 and IPv6) and\nlayer 4 (eg. TCP,UDP,ICMP) headers, with no packet payload.\n\nTraces are named using the following format:\n  {monitor}.{direction}.{start-time}.anon.pcap.gz\n\n     * monitor: equinix-chicago\n     * direction: dirA / dirB\n     * start-time: time trace began, format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss.UTC\n\nMD5 checksums were kept with the trace files, and files were checked against\nthese checksums whenever data was transferred between physical media.\n\nAt different stages of the traffic capturing process packet loss can occur,\nat the end of this README we try to summarize the different types of losses\nwe detected during various stages.\n\nDue to the way the monitoring equipment is set up to do time-synchronization \nwe don't know how well-aligned timestamps between directions of a single link\nare.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA UCSD Anonymized Internet Traces - [dates used],\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n    Support for CAIDA's Internet Traces is provided by the National Science\n    Foundation, the US Department of Homeland Security, and\n    CAIDA Members.\n\n\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nThe equinix-chicago OC192 monitor setup:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\n\nThe Day in the Life of the Internet project:\n    https://www.caida.org/projects/ditl/\n\nThe CoralReef Software Suite:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\n\n\nMetadata\n--------\n\nThis section provides some more detailed information on various traces,\nspecifically on packet loss.\npkts_captured:       Total number of packets that was captured by hardware\npkts_lost_hw:        Number of packets the capturing hardware reported to have\n   lost.

This trace contains anonymized packet headers in pcap format on a single direction of the bidirectional OC192 link at equinix-chicago from approximately 2008-03-19 19:00 to 20:00 UTC. The hardware monitoring the other direction of the link was not functioning properly at the time of the traffic capture, so only data for a single direction was captured.<br>\n<br>\nFor the <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a>  monitor, the first monthly bidirectional traffic\ntrace was taken on April 30 2008, and added to the Anonymized 2008 Internet\nTrace dataset in June 2008. This one-hour trace resulted in 83 GB of compressed\npcap files. The first monthly bidirectional traffic trace from the\n<i>equinix-sanjose</i> monitor was taken on July 17 2008.\n<br>\nStarting with the 2014 dataset the yearly passive trace datasets only contain\none trace per quarter (previous years contain one trace per month). While we still\ncollect a one-hour trace each month (and add statistics about each trace to\nthe <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/trace_stats/\">trace statistics</a> page),\nwe are forced by storage limitations to select only one of the three traces for\neach quarter for inclusion in this yearly collection.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nTraffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. The anonymization key changes annually and is the same for all traces recorded during the same calendar year.  \nDuring capture packets are truncated at a snap length selected to avoid excessive packet loss due to disk I/O overload. The snap length has historically varied from 64 to 96 bytes. In addition, payload is removed from all packets: only header information upto layer 4 (transport layer) remains.\n<br>\nThe Endace network cards used to record these traces provide timestamps with nanosecond\nprecision. However, the anonymized traces are stored in pcap format with timestamps\ntruncated to microseconds. Starting with the 2010 traces the original nanosecond timestamps are provided as separate ascii files alongside the pcap files.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe traces can be read with any software that reads the pcap (tcpdump)\nformat, including the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\">CoralReef Software Suite</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org\">tcpdump</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">Wireshark</a>,\nand many others.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe are aware that 2008 data contains more then trivial amounts\nof packet loss; this has especially been an issue for <i>equinix-chicago</i>\ndirection B. Due to the way the monitoring equipment is set up the\nsynchronization between directions we don't know how well-aligned both\ndirections of a single link are. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe related  <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_ipv6day_and_ipv6launch_dataset\"><b>IPv6 Day and World IPv6 Launch Day</b></a> Dataset contains  three anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitors on high-speed Internet backbone links taken during IPv6 Day on 8 June 2011,\nand three additional traces from the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitor taken during IPv6 Launch Day on 6 June 2012 (the Chicago monitors were\noffline on IPv6 Launch Day).\n The traces cover start, middle and end of the 24-hour IPv6 Day and IPv6 Launch Day\nperiods. The first IPv6 Day trace runs from 7 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n8 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC, the second trace from on 8 June 2011 13:00:00 UTC to\n14:00:00 UTC and the final trace runs from 8 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n9 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC. The three traces on IPv6 Launch Day run from\n5 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to 6 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, from 6 June 2012 13:00:00 UTC\nto 6 June 2012 14:00:00 UTC, and from 6 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to\n7 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, respectively.\n Traffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. All traces in this dataset are anonymized with the same key.\nIn addition, the payload has been removed from all packets.\nThe dataset size is 194 GB, 172 GB and 198 GB for each of the three IPv6 Day\ntraces, respectively.

It contains traffic traces from the 'equinix-nyc'\nhigh-speed monitor.\n\nNote that, starting with the year 2014, the yearly passive trace datasets\nwill only contain one trace per quarter (previous years contain one trace\nper month). While we still collect a one-hour trace each month (and add\nstatistics about each trace to the trace statistics page), we are forced\nby storage limitations to select only one of the three traces for each\nquarter for inclusion in this yearly collection.\n\nDataset Contents\n----------------\n    - trace files (*.pcap.gz): compressed pcap (tcpdump) format traces\n    - time files (*.times.gz): contains original nanosecond-precision timestamps\n         The nanosecond timestamps in each *.times.gz line up exactly with the\n         packets in the corresponding pcap file (containing timestamps truncated\n         to microsecond precision).\n    - stats files (*.pcap.stats): statistics on the trace, produced by crl_stats\n         (part of the CoralReef suite of tools).\n    - file md5.md5: contains md5 checksums for all files\n\nCreation process\n----------------\n\nRaw traces were taken on Endace DAG cards with 'dagconvert'\n(part of Endace dagtools):\n\n  dagconvert -s SNAPLEN -v -V -d DAG_DEVICE -t DURATION -r 2g -T dag:erf -o RAW_TRACE\n\nRaw traces were stripped of payload with:\n  crl_to_dag -l4 -Cipfilter='1=1' -o STRIPPED_TRACE RAW_TRACE\n\nPayload-stripped traces were anonymized and split in 1-minute chunks with:\n  crl_to_pcap -r -Canon=KEYFILE -Cai -Ci=60 -o ANON_TRACE STRIPPED_TRACE \n\nThis resulted in pcap files that only include layer 3 (IPv4 and IPv6) and\nlayer 4 (eg. TCP,UDP,ICMP) headers, with no packet payload.\n\nTraces are named using the following format:\n  {monitor}.{direction}.{start-time}.anon.pcap.gz\n\n     * monitor: equinix-nyc\n     * direction: dirA / dirB\n     * start-time: time trace began, format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss.UTC\n\nMD5 checksums were kept with the trace files, and files were checked against\nthese checksums whenever data was transferred between physical media.\n\nAt different stages of the traffic capturing process packet loss can occur,\nat the end of this README we try to summarize the different types of losses\nwe detected during various stages.\n\nDue to the way the monitoring equipment is set up to do time-synchronization \nwe don't know how well-aligned timestamps between directions of a single link\nare.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA UCSD Anonymized Internet Traces  - [dates used],\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n    Support for CAIDA's Internet Traces is provided by the National Science\n    Foundation, the US Department of Homeland Security, and\n    CAIDA Members.\n\n\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nThe equinix-nyc OC192 monitor setup:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/equinix-nyc\n\nThe Day in the Life of the Internet project:\n    https://www.caida.org/projects/ditl/\n\nThe CoralReef Software Suite:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\n\n\nMetadata\n--------\n\nThis section provides some more detailed information on various traces,\nspecifically on packet loss.\npkts_captured:       Total number of packets that was captured by hardware\npkts_lost_hw:        Number of packets the capturing hardware reported to have\n   lost.

This trace contains anonymized packet headers in pcap format on a single direction of the bidirectional OC192 link at equinix-chicago from approximately 2008-03-19 19:00 to 20:00 UTC. The hardware monitoring the other direction of the link was not functioning properly at the time of the traffic capture, so only data for a single direction was captured.<br>\n<br>\nFor the <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a>  monitor, the first monthly bidirectional traffic\ntrace was taken on April 30 2008, and added to the Anonymized 2008 Internet\nTrace dataset in June 2008. This one-hour trace resulted in 83 GB of compressed\npcap files. The first monthly bidirectional traffic trace from the\n<i>equinix-sanjose</i> monitor was taken on July 17 2008.\n<br>\nStarting with the 2014 dataset the yearly passive trace datasets only contain\none trace per quarter (previous years contain one trace per month). While we still\ncollect a one-hour trace each month (and add statistics about each trace to\nthe <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/trace_stats/\">trace statistics</a> page),\nwe are forced by storage limitations to select only one of the three traces for\neach quarter for inclusion in this yearly collection.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nTraffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. The anonymization key changes annually and is the same for all traces recorded during the same calendar year.  \nDuring capture packets are truncated at a snap length selected to avoid excessive packet loss due to disk I/O overload. The snap length has historically varied from 64 to 96 bytes. In addition, payload is removed from all packets: only header information upto layer 4 (transport layer) remains.\n<br>\nThe Endace network cards used to record these traces provide timestamps with nanosecond\nprecision. However, the anonymized traces are stored in pcap format with timestamps\ntruncated to microseconds. Starting with the 2010 traces the original nanosecond timestamps are provided as separate ascii files alongside the pcap files.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe traces can be read with any software that reads the pcap (tcpdump)\nformat, including the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\">CoralReef Software Suite</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org\">tcpdump</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">Wireshark</a>,\nand many others.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe are aware that 2008 data contains more then trivial amounts\nof packet loss; this has especially been an issue for <i>equinix-chicago</i>\ndirection B. Due to the way the monitoring equipment is set up the\nsynchronization between directions we don't know how well-aligned both\ndirections of a single link are. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe related  <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_ipv6day_and_ipv6launch_dataset\"><b>IPv6 Day and World IPv6 Launch Day</b></a> Dataset contains  three anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitors on high-speed Internet backbone links taken during IPv6 Day on 8 June 2011,\nand three additional traces from the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitor taken during IPv6 Launch Day on 6 June 2012 (the Chicago monitors were\noffline on IPv6 Launch Day).\n The traces cover start, middle and end of the 24-hour IPv6 Day and IPv6 Launch Day\nperiods. The first IPv6 Day trace runs from 7 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n8 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC, the second trace from on 8 June 2011 13:00:00 UTC to\n14:00:00 UTC and the final trace runs from 8 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n9 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC. The three traces on IPv6 Launch Day run from\n5 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to 6 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, from 6 June 2012 13:00:00 UTC\nto 6 June 2012 14:00:00 UTC, and from 6 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to\n7 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, respectively.\n Traffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. All traces in this dataset are anonymized with the same key.\nIn addition, the payload has been removed from all packets.\nThe dataset size is 194 GB, 172 GB and 198 GB for each of the three IPv6 Day\ntraces, respectively. The IPv6 Launch Day sizes are 177 GB, 121 GB and 171 GB.\n</p>\n<h3>Acceptable Use Agreement</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Access to these data is subject to the terms of the following CAIDA Acceptable Use Agreement</b>\n(<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/about/legal/aua/caida_aua.pdf\">printable version</a> in PDF format)<br>\n<textarea xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\" rows=\"20\" cols=\"100%\" readonly style=\"background-color:#eee;border:thin solid black;\">\nCAIDA ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT\n(ver 071814)\n\nThe following terms comprise the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Data License Agreement\n(collectively, the \"AGREEMENT\", or, \"Acceptable Use Agreement (AUA)\" for all datasets made\navailable to You by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), a research unit\nat the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and governed by The Regents of the University\nof California.

It contains traffic traces from the 'equinix-nyc'\nhigh-speed monitor.\n\nNote that, starting with the year 2014, the yearly passive trace datasets\nwill only contain one trace per quarter (previous years contain one trace\nper month). While we still collect a one-hour trace each month (and add\nstatistics about each trace to the trace statistics page), we are forced\nby storage limitations to select only one of the three traces for each\nquarter for inclusion in this yearly collection.\n\nDataset Contents\n----------------\n    - trace files (*.pcap.gz): compressed pcap (tcpdump) format traces\n    - time files (*.times.gz): contains original nanosecond-precision timestamps\n         The nanosecond timestamps in each *.times.gz line up exactly with the\n         packets in the corresponding pcap file (containing timestamps truncated\n         to microsecond precision).\n    - stats files (*.pcap.stats): statistics on the trace, produced by crl_stats\n         (part of the CoralReef suite of tools).\n    - file md5.md5: contains md5 checksums for all files\n\nCreation process\n----------------\n\nRaw traces were taken on Endace DAG cards with 'dagconvert'\n(part of Endace dagtools):\n\n  dagconvert -s SNAPLEN -v -V -d DAG_DEVICE -t DURATION -r 2g -T dag:erf -o RAW_TRACE\n\nRaw traces were stripped of payload with:\n  crl_to_dag -l4 -Cipfilter='1=1' -o STRIPPED_TRACE RAW_TRACE\n\nPayload-stripped traces were anonymized and split in 1-minute chunks with:\n  crl_to_pcap -r -Canon=KEYFILE -Cai -Ci=60 -o ANON_TRACE STRIPPED_TRACE \n\nThis resulted in pcap files that only include layer 3 (IPv4 and IPv6) and\nlayer 4 (eg. TCP,UDP,ICMP) headers, with no packet payload.\n\nTraces are named using the following format:\n  {monitor}.{direction}.{start-time}.anon.pcap.gz\n\n     * monitor: equinix-nyc\n     * direction: dirA / dirB\n     * start-time: time trace began, format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss.UTC\n\nMD5 checksums were kept with the trace files, and files were checked against\nthese checksums whenever data was transferred between physical media.\n\nAt different stages of the traffic capturing process packet loss can occur,\nat the end of this README we try to summarize the different types of losses\nwe detected during various stages.\n\nDue to the way the monitoring equipment is set up to do time-synchronization \nwe don't know how well-aligned timestamps between directions of a single link\nare.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA UCSD Anonymized Internet Traces  - [dates used],\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n    Support for CAIDA's Internet Traces is provided by the National Science\n    Foundation, the US Department of Homeland Security, and\n    CAIDA Members.\n\n\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nThe equinix-nyc OC192 monitor setup:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/equinix-nyc\n\nThe Day in the Life of the Internet project:\n    https://www.caida.org/projects/ditl/\n\nThe CoralReef Software Suite:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\n\n\nMetadata\n--------\n\nThis section provides some more detailed information on various traces,\nspecifically on packet loss.\npkts_captured:       Total number of packets that was captured by hardware\npkts_lost_hw:        Number of packets the capturing hardware reported to have\n   lost. '>=' indicates that the loss between 2 packets in the traces was more\n   then the loss counter can accomodate (65535 packets).\npkts_lost_stripping: Number of packets removed from traces as result of payload stripping step\npkts_lost_anon:      Number of packets lost from traces as result of anonymization step\n\nNote that these numbers are the packet loss we can measure.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nEvent log:\n\n---\n\n"}],

The first IPv6 Day trace runs from 7 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n8 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC, the second trace from on 8 June 2011 13:00:00 UTC to\n14:00:00 UTC and the final trace runs from 8 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n9 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC. The three traces on IPv6 Launch Day run from\n5 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to 6 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, from 6 June 2012 13:00:00 UTC\nto 6 June 2012 14:00:00 UTC, and from 6 June 2012 23:45:00 UTC to\n7 June 2012 00:45:00 UTC, respectively.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis data is useful for research on the characteristics of Internet traffic,\nincluding application breakdown, security events, topological\ndistribution, and flow volume and duration.\n</p>\n<p>\nTraffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. All traces in this dataset are anonymized with the same key.\nIn addition, the payload has been removed from all packets.\nThe dataset size is 194 GB, 172 GB and 198 GB for each of the three IPv6 Day\ntraces, respectively. The IPv6 Launch Day sizes are 177 GB, 121 GB and 171 GB. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe Endace network cards used to record these traces provide timestamps with\nnanosecond precision. However, the anonymized traces are stored in pcap\nformat with timestamps truncated to microseconds.

This dataset contains traffic traces\nfrom the 'equinix-chicago' and 'equinix-sanjose' high-speed monitors.\nThree one-hour traces were taken for each monitor: one at the beginning of\nIPv6 Day (7 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to 8 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC), a second\ntrace on 8 June 2011 13:00:00 UTC to 14:00:00 UTC (this trace is also part\nof the passive-2011 dataset) and a final trace at the close of IPv6 Day\n(8 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to 9 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC).\n\nDataset Contents\n----------------\n    - trace files (*.pcap.gz): compressed pcap (tcpdump) format traces\n    - time files (*.times.gz): contains original nanosecond-precision timestamps.\n         The nanosecond timestamps in each *.times.gz line up exactly with the\n         packets in the corresponding pcap file (containing timestamps truncated\n         to microsecond precision).\n    - stats files (*.pcap.stats): statistics on the trace, produced by crl_stats\n         (part of the CoralReef suite of tools).\n    - file md5.md5: contains md5 checksums for all files\n\nCreation process\n----------------\n\nRaw traces were taken on Endace DAG cards with 'dagconvert' (part of Endace dagtools):\n\n  dagconvert -s SNAPLEN -v -V -d DAG_DEVICE -t DURATION -r 2g -T dag:erf -o RAW_TRACE\n\nRaw traces were stripped of payload with:\n  crl_to_dag -l4 -Cipfilter='1=1' -o STRIPPED_TRACE RAW_TRACE\n\nPayload-stripped traces were anonymized and split in 1-minute chunks with:\n  crl_to_pcap -r -Canon=KEYFILE -Cai -Ci=60 -o ANON_TRACE STRIPPED_TRACE \n\nThis resulted in pcap files that only include layer 3 (IPv4 and IPv6) and layer 4\n(eg. TCP,UDP,ICMP) headers, with no packet payload.\n\nTraces are named using the following format: {monitor}.{direction}.{start-time}.anon.pcap.gz\n\n     * monitor: equinix-chicago / equinix-sanjose\n     * direction: dirA / dirB\n     * start-time: time trace began, format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss.UTC\n\nMD5 checksums were kept with the trace files, and files were checked against\nthese checksums whenever data was transferred between physical media.\n\nAt different stages of the traffic capturing process packet loss can occur, at the end of\nthis README we try to summarize the different types of losses we detected during various\nstages.\n\nDue to the way the monitoring equipment is set up to do time-synchronization \nwe don't know how well-aligned timestamps between directions of a single link are.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA UCSD Anonymized Internet Traces 2011 on IPv6 Day - [dates used],\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_ipv6day_and_ipv6launch_dataset\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n    Support for CAIDA's Internet Traces is provided by the National Science\n    Foundation, the US Department of Homeland Security, and\n    CAIDA Members.\n\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nThe equinix-chicago and equinix-sanjose high-speed monitor setup:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\n\nThe Day in the Life of the Internet project:\n    https://www.caida.org/projects/ditl/\n\nThe CoralReef Software Suite:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\n\n\nMetadata\n--------\n\nThis section provides some more detailed information on various traces, specifically\non packet loss.\npkts_captured:       Total number of packets that was captured by hardware\npkts_lost_hw:        Number of packets the capturing hardware reported to have\n   lost.

This trace contains anonymized packet headers in pcap format on a single direction of the bidirectional OC192 link at equinix-chicago from approximately 2008-03-19 19:00 to 20:00 UTC. The hardware monitoring the other direction of the link was not functioning properly at the time of the traffic capture, so only data for a single direction was captured.<br>\n<br>\nFor the <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a>  monitor, the first monthly bidirectional traffic\ntrace was taken on April 30 2008, and added to the Anonymized 2008 Internet\nTrace dataset in June 2008. This one-hour trace resulted in 83 GB of compressed\npcap files. The first monthly bidirectional traffic trace from the\n<i>equinix-sanjose</i> monitor was taken on July 17 2008.\n<br>\nStarting with the 2014 dataset the yearly passive trace datasets only contain\none trace per quarter (previous years contain one trace per month). While we still\ncollect a one-hour trace each month (and add statistics about each trace to\nthe <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/trace_stats/\">trace statistics</a> page),\nwe are forced by storage limitations to select only one of the three traces for\neach quarter for inclusion in this yearly collection.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nTraffic traces in this dataset are anonymized using CryptoPan prefix-preserving\nanonymization. The anonymization key changes annually and is the same for all traces recorded during the same calendar year.  \nDuring capture packets are truncated at a snap length selected to avoid excessive packet loss due to disk I/O overload. The snap length has historically varied from 64 to 96 bytes. In addition, payload is removed from all packets: only header information upto layer 4 (transport layer) remains.\n<br>\nThe Endace network cards used to record these traces provide timestamps with nanosecond\nprecision. However, the anonymized traces are stored in pcap format with timestamps\ntruncated to microseconds. Starting with the 2010 traces the original nanosecond timestamps are provided as separate ascii files alongside the pcap files.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe traces can be read with any software that reads the pcap (tcpdump)\nformat, including the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\">CoralReef Software Suite</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org\">tcpdump</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">Wireshark</a>,\nand many others.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe are aware that 2008 data contains more then trivial amounts\nof packet loss; this has especially been an issue for <i>equinix-chicago</i>\ndirection B. Due to the way the monitoring equipment is set up the\nsynchronization between directions we don't know how well-aligned both\ndirections of a single link are. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe related  <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_ipv6day_and_ipv6launch_dataset\"><b>IPv6 Day and World IPv6 Launch Day</b></a> Dataset contains  three anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\"><i>equinix-chicago</i></a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitors on high-speed Internet backbone links taken during IPv6 Day on 8 June 2011,\nand three additional traces from the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-sanjose\"><i>equinix-sanjose</i></a>\nmonitor taken during IPv6 Launch Day on 6 June 2012 (the Chicago monitors were\noffline on IPv6 Launch Day).\n The traces cover start, middle and end of the 24-hour IPv6 Day and IPv6 Launch Day\nperiods. The first IPv6 Day trace runs from 7 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n8 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC, the second trace from on 8 June 2011 13:00:00 UTC to\n14:00:00 UTC and the final trace runs from 8 June 2011 23:45:00 UTC to\n9 June 2011 00:45:00 UTC.

This trace contains anonymized packet headers in pcap format on a single direction of the bidirectional OC192 link at equinix-chicago from approximately 2008-03-19 19:00 to 20:00 UTC. The hardware monitoring the other direction of the link was not functioning properly at the time of the traffic capture, so only data for a single direction was captured.\n-------\n \nThe CAIDA Anonymized Internet Traces 2008 Dataset\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nThis dataset contains anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's passive\nmonitors in 2008. Currently this dataset contains traffic from the\n'equinix-chicago' OC192 monitors, starting with a 1 hour trace on March 19 2008\nfor a single direction of a bidirectional OC192 link.  This trace was taken as\npart of the Day in the Life of the Internet (DITL) 2008 measurement event.\nThis dataset has monthly traces from monitors on OC192 links, starting\nfrom April 2008. See the 'Trace details' section for more information on\nindividual monthly traces.\n\nStarting April 2008 monthly traces were taken on the 'equinix-chicago' monitor.\nStarting July 2008 monthly traces were taken on the 'equinix-sanjose' monitor.\n\nDataset Contents\n----------------\n    - trace files (*.pcap.gz): compressed pcap (tcpdump) format traces\n    - md5 files (*.pcap.gz.md5): md5 checksum of the trace\n    - stats files (*.pcap.stats): statistics on the trace, produced by crl_stats\n      (part of the CoralReef suite of tools).\n\nCreation process\n----------------\n\nRaw traces were taken on Endace DAG cards with 'dagconvert' (part of Endace dagtools):\n\n  dagconvert -s SNAPLEN -v -V -d DAG_DEVICE -t DURATION -r 2g -T dag:erf -o RAW_TRACE\n\nRaw traces were stripped of payload with:\n  crl_to_dag -l4 -Cipfilter='1=1' -o STRIPPED_TRACE RAW_TRACE\n\nPayload-stripped traces were anonymized and split in 1-minute chunks with:\n  crl_to_pcap -r -Canon=KEYFILE -Cai -Ci=60 -o ANON_TRACE STRIPPED_TRACE \n\nThis resulted in pcap files that only include layer 3 (IPv4 and IPv6) and layer 4\n(eg. TCP,UDP,ICMP) headers, with no packet payload.\n\nTraces are named using the following format: {monitor}.{direction}.{start-time}.anon.pcap.gz\n\n     * monitor: eq-chic / eq-snjc\n     * direction: dirA / dirB\n     * start-time: time trace began, format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss.UTC\n\nMD5 checksums were kept with the trace files, and files were checked against\nthese checksums whenever data was transferred between physical media.\n\nAt different stages of the traffic capturing process packet loss can occur, at the end of\nthis README we try to summarize the different types of losses we detected during various\nstages.\n\nWe are aware that some data in the Anonymized 2008 Internet traces dataset\ncontains more then trivial amounts of packet loss; this has especially been an issue\nfor equinix-chicago direction B (dirB). Please see the 'Metadata' section for\nmore detailed information on packet loss.\n    \nDue to the way the monitoring equipment is set up to do time-synchronization \nwe don't know how well-aligned timestamps between directions of a single link are.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA UCSD Anonymized Internet Traces - [dates used],\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n    Support for CAIDA's Internet Traces is provided by the National Science\n    Foundation, the US Department of Homeland Security, and\n    CAIDA Members.\n\n\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nThe equinix-chicago OC192 monitor setup:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\n\nThe Day in the Life of the Internet project:\n    https://www.caida.org/projects/ditl/\n\nThe CoralReef Software Suite:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\n\nMetadata\n--------\n\nThis section provides some more detailed information on various traces, specifically\non packet loss.\npkts_captured:       Total number of packets that was captured by hardware\npkts_lost_hw:        Number of packets the capturing hardware reported to have\n   lost.

Anonymized Internet Traces 2009 Dataset\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nThis dataset contains anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's passive\nmonitors in 2009. This dataset contains traffic traces from the 'equinix-chicago' and\n'equinix-sanjose' OC192 monitors.\n\nDataset Contents\n----------------\n    - trace files (*.pcap.gz): compressed pcap (tcpdump) format traces\n    - md5 files (*.pcap.gz.md5): md5 checksum of the trace\n    - stats files (*.pcap.stats): statistics on the trace, produced by crl_stats\n      (part of the CoralReef suite of tools).\n\nCreation process\n----------------\n\nRaw traces were taken on Endace DAG cards with 'dagconvert' (part of Endace dagtools):\n\n  dagconvert -s SNAPLEN -v -V -d DAG_DEVICE -t DURATION -r 2g -T dag:erf -o RAW_TRACE\n\nRaw traces were stripped of payload with:\n  crl_to_dag -l4 -Cipfilter='1=1' -o STRIPPED_TRACE RAW_TRACE\n\nPayload-stripped traces were anonymized and split in 1-minute chunks with:\n  crl_to_pcap -r -Canon=KEYFILE -Cai -Ci=60 -o ANON_TRACE STRIPPED_TRACE \n\nThis resulted in pcap files that only include layer 3 (IPv4 and IPv6) and layer 4\n(eg. TCP,UDP,ICMP) headers, with no packet payload.\n\nTraces are named using the following format: {monitor}.{direction}.{start-time}.anon.pcap.gz\n\n     * monitor: equinix-chicago / equinix-sanjose\n     * direction: dirA / dirB\n     * start-time: time trace began, format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss.UTC\n\nMD5 checksums were kept with the trace files, and files were checked against\nthese checksums whenever data was transferred between physical media.\n\nAt different stages of the traffic capturing process packet loss can occur, at the end of\nthis README we try to summarize the different types of losses we detected during various\nstages.\n\nDue to the way the monitoring equipment is set up to do time-synchronization \nwe don't know how well-aligned timestamps between directions of a single link are.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA UCSD Anonymized Internet Traces - [dates used],\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n    Support for CAIDA's Internet Traces is provided by the National Science\n    Foundation, the US Department of Homeland Security, and\n    CAIDA Members.\n\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nThe equinix-chicago OC192 monitor setup:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\n\nThe Day in the Life of the Internet project:\n    https://www.caida.org/projects/ditl/\n\nThe CoralReef Software Suite:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\n\n\nMetadata\n--------\n\nThis section provides some more detailed information on various traces, specifically\non packet loss.\npkts_captured:       Total number of packets that was captured by hardware\npkts_lost_hw:        Number of packets the capturing hardware reported to have\n   lost.

monitors see only one of these links.\nmonitors: equinix-chicago (both directions)\nThe CAIDA Anonymized Internet Traces 2010 Dataset\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nThis dataset contains anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's passive\nmonitors in 2010. This dataset contains traffic traces from the 'equinix-chicago' and\n'equinix-sanjose' OC192 monitors.\n\nDataset Contents\n----------------\n    - trace files (*.pcap.gz): compressed pcap (tcpdump) format traces\n    - time files (*.times.gz): contains original nanosecond-precision timestamps.\n         The nanosecond timestamps in each *.times.gz line up exactly with the\n         packets in the corresponding pcap file (containing timestamps truncated\n         to microsecond precision).\n    - stats files (*.pcap.stats): statistics on the trace, produced by crl_stats\n         (part of the CoralReef suite of tools).\n    - file md5.md5: contains md5 checksums for all files\n\nCreation process\n----------------\n\nRaw traces were taken on Endace DAG cards with 'dagconvert' (part of Endace dagtools):\n\n  dagconvert -s SNAPLEN -v -V -d DAG_DEVICE -t DURATION -r 2g -T dag:erf -o RAW_TRACE\n\nRaw traces were stripped of payload with:\n  crl_to_dag -l4 -Cipfilter='1=1' -o STRIPPED_TRACE RAW_TRACE\n\nPayload-stripped traces were anonymized and split in 1-minute chunks with:\n  crl_to_pcap -r -Canon=KEYFILE -Cai -Ci=60 -o ANON_TRACE STRIPPED_TRACE \n\nThis resulted in pcap files that only include layer 3 (IPv4 and IPv6) and layer 4\n(eg. TCP,UDP,ICMP) headers, with no packet payload.\n\nTraces are named using the following format: {monitor}.{direction}.{start-time}.anon.pcap.gz\n\n     * monitor: equinix-chicago / equinix-sanjose\n     * direction: dirA / dirB\n     * start-time: time trace began, format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss.UTC\n\nMD5 checksums were kept with the trace files, and files were checked against\nthese checksums whenever data was transferred between physical media.\n\nAt different stages of the traffic capturing process packet loss can occur, at the end of\nthis README we try to summarize the different types of losses we detected during various\nstages.\n\nDue to the way the monitoring equipment is set up to do time-synchronization \nwe don't know how well-aligned timestamps between directions of a single link are.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA UCSD Anonymized Internet Traces - [dates used],\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n    Support for CAIDA's Internet Traces is provided by the National Science\n    Foundation, the US Department of Homeland Security, and\n    CAIDA Members.\n\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nThe equinix-chicago OC192 monitor setup:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\n\nThe Day in the Life of the Internet project:\n    https://www.caida.org/projects/ditl/\n\nThe CoralReef Software Suite:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\n\n\nMetadata\n--------\n\nThis section provides some more detailed information on various traces, specifically\non packet loss.\npkts_captured:       Total number of packets that was captured by hardware\npkts_lost_hw:        Number of packets the capturing hardware reported to have\n   lost. '>=' indicates that the loss between 2 packets in the traces was more\n   then the loss counter can accomodate (65535 packets).\npkts_lost_stripping: Number of packets removed from traces as result of payload stripping step\npkts_lost_anon:      Number of packets lost from traces as result of anonymization step\n\nNote that these numbers are the packet loss we can measure.\n\n---\n\nname:

the dag cards.\n        The dag cards currently do not see any packets.\n\nThe CAIDA Anonymized Internet Traces 2011 Dataset\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nThis dataset contains anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's passive\nmonitors in 2011. This dataset contains traffic traces from the 'equinix-chicago' and\n'equinix-sanjose' high-speed monitors.\n\nDataset Contents\n----------------\n    - trace files (*.pcap.gz): compressed pcap (tcpdump) format traces\n    - time files (*.times.gz): contains original nanosecond-precision timestamps.\n         The nanosecond timestamps in each *.times.gz line up exactly with the\n         packets in the corresponding pcap file (containing timestamps truncated\n         to microsecond precision).\n    - stats files (*.pcap.stats): statistics on the trace, produced by crl_stats\n         (part of the CoralReef suite of tools).\n    - file md5.md5: contains md5 checksums for all files\n\nCreation process\n----------------\n\nRaw traces were taken on Endace DAG cards with 'dagconvert' (part of Endace dagtools):\n\n  dagconvert -s SNAPLEN -v -V -d DAG_DEVICE -t DURATION -r 2g -T dag:erf -o RAW_TRACE\n\nRaw traces were stripped of payload with:\n  crl_to_dag -l4 -Cipfilter='1=1' -o STRIPPED_TRACE RAW_TRACE\n\nPayload-stripped traces were anonymized and split in 1-minute chunks with:\n  crl_to_pcap -r -Canon=KEYFILE -Cai -Ci=60 -o ANON_TRACE STRIPPED_TRACE \n\nThis resulted in pcap files that only include layer 3 (IPv4 and IPv6) and layer 4\n(eg. TCP,UDP,ICMP) headers, with no packet payload.\n\nTraces are named using the following format: {monitor}.{direction}.{start-time}.anon.pcap.gz\n\n     * monitor: equinix-chicago / equinix-sanjose\n     * direction: dirA / dirB\n     * start-time: time trace began, format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss.UTC\n\nMD5 checksums were kept with the trace files, and files were checked against\nthese checksums whenever data was transferred between physical media.\n\nAt different stages of the traffic capturing process packet loss can occur, at the end of\nthis README we try to summarize the different types of losses we detected during various\nstages.\n\nDue to the way the monitoring equipment is set up to do time-synchronization \nwe don't know how well-aligned timestamps between directions of a single link are.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA UCSD Anonymized Internet Traces - [dates used],\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n    Support for CAIDA's Internet Traces is provided by the National Science\n    Foundation, the US Department of Homeland Security, and\n    CAIDA Members.\n\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nThe equinix-chicago OC192 monitor setup:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\n\nThe Day in the Life of the Internet project:\n    https://www.caida.org/projects/ditl/\n\nThe CoralReef Software Suite:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\n\n\nMetadata\n--------\n\nThis section provides some more detailed information on various traces, specifically\non packet loss.\npkts_captured:       Total number of packets that was captured by hardware\npkts_lost_hw:        Number of packets the capturing hardware reported to have\n   lost.

No Chicago traces exist for\nthe last four months of 2011.\n\n---\n\nThe CAIDA Anonymized Internet Traces 2012 Dataset\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nThis dataset contains anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's passive\nmonitors in 2012. It contains traffic traces from the 'equinix-chicago' and\n'equinix-sanjose' high-speed monitors.\n\nDataset Contents\n----------------\n    - trace files (*.pcap.gz): compressed pcap (tcpdump) format traces\n    - time files (*.times.gz): contains original nanosecond-precision timestamps.\n         The nanosecond timestamps in each *.times.gz line up exactly with the\n         packets in the corresponding pcap file (containing timestamps truncated\n         to microsecond precision).\n    - stats files (*.pcap.stats): statistics on the trace, produced by crl_stats\n         (part of the CoralReef suite of tools).\n    - file md5.md5: contains md5 checksums for all files\n\nCreation process\n----------------\n\nRaw traces were taken on Endace DAG cards with 'dagconvert' (part of Endace dagtools):\n\n  dagconvert -s SNAPLEN -v -V -d DAG_DEVICE -t DURATION -r 2g -T dag:erf -o RAW_TRACE\n\nRaw traces were stripped of payload with:\n  crl_to_dag -l4 -Cipfilter='1=1' -o STRIPPED_TRACE RAW_TRACE\n\nPayload-stripped traces were anonymized and split in 1-minute chunks with:\n  crl_to_pcap -r -Canon=KEYFILE -Cai -Ci=60 -o ANON_TRACE STRIPPED_TRACE \n\nThis resulted in pcap files that only include layer 3 (IPv4 and IPv6) and layer 4\n(eg. TCP,UDP,ICMP) headers, with no packet payload.\n\nTraces are named using the following format: {monitor}.{direction}.{start-time}.anon.pcap.gz\n\n     * monitor: equinix-chicago / equinix-sanjose\n     * direction: dirA / dirB\n     * start-time: time trace began, format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss.UTC\n\nMD5 checksums were kept with the trace files, and files were checked against\nthese checksums whenever data was transferred between physical media.\n\nAt different stages of the traffic capturing process packet loss can occur, at the end of\nthis README we try to summarize the different types of losses we detected during various\nstages.\n\nDue to the way the monitoring equipment is set up to do time-synchronization \nwe don't know how well-aligned timestamps between directions of a single link are.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA UCSD Anonymized Internet Traces - [dates used],\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n    Support for CAIDA's Internet Traces is provided by the National Science\n    Foundation, the US Department of Homeland Security, and\n    CAIDA Members.\n\n\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nThe equinix-chicago OC192 monitor setup:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\n\nThe Day in the Life of the Internet project:\n    https://www.caida.org/projects/ditl/\n\nThe CoralReef Software Suite:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\n\n\nMetadata\n--------\n\nThis section provides some more detailed information on various traces, specifically\non packet loss.\npkts_captured:       Total number of packets that was captured by hardware\npkts_lost_hw:        Number of packets the capturing hardware reported to have\n   lost. '>=' indicates that the loss between 2 packets in the traces was more\n   then the loss counter can accomodate (65535 packets).\npkts_lost_stripping: Number of packets removed from traces as result of payload stripping step\npkts_lost_anon:      Number of packets lost from traces as result of anonymization step\n\nNote that these numbers are the packet loss we can measure.\n\n---\n\nname:

log:\n\n---\n\nThe CAIDA Anonymized Internet Traces 2013 Dataset\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nThis dataset contains anonymized passive traffic traces from CAIDA's passive\nmonitors in 2013. It contains traffic traces from the 'equinix-chicago' and\n'equinix-sanjose' high-speed monitors.\n\nDataset Contents\n----------------\n    - trace files (*.pcap.gz): compressed pcap (tcpdump) format traces\n    - time files (*.times.gz): contains original nanosecond-precision timestamps.\n         The nanosecond timestamps in each *.times.gz line up exactly with the\n         packets in the corresponding pcap file (containing timestamps truncated\n         to microsecond precision).\n    - stats files (*.pcap.stats): statistics on the trace, produced by crl_stats\n         (part of the CoralReef suite of tools).\n    - file md5.md5: contains md5 checksums for all files\n\nCreation process\n----------------\n\nRaw traces were taken on Endace DAG cards with 'dagconvert' (part of Endace dagtools):\n\n  dagconvert -s SNAPLEN -v -V -d DAG_DEVICE -t DURATION -r 2g -T dag:erf -o RAW_TRACE\n\nRaw traces were stripped of payload with:\n  crl_to_dag -l4 -Cipfilter='1=1' -o STRIPPED_TRACE RAW_TRACE\n\nPayload-stripped traces were anonymized and split in 1-minute chunks with:\n  crl_to_pcap -r -Canon=KEYFILE -Cai -Ci=60 -o ANON_TRACE STRIPPED_TRACE \n\nThis resulted in pcap files that only include layer 3 (IPv4 and IPv6) and layer 4\n(eg. TCP,UDP,ICMP) headers, with no packet payload.\n\nTraces are named using the following format: {monitor}.{direction}.{start-time}.anon.pcap.gz\n\n     * monitor: equinix-chicago / equinix-sanjose\n     * direction: dirA / dirB\n     * start-time: time trace began, format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss.UTC\n\nMD5 checksums were kept with the trace files, and files were checked against\nthese checksums whenever data was transferred between physical media.\n\nAt different stages of the traffic capturing process packet loss can occur, at the end of\nthis README we try to summarize the different types of losses we detected during various\nstages.\n\nDue to the way the monitoring equipment is set up to do time-synchronization \nwe don't know how well-aligned timestamps between directions of a single link are.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA UCSD Anonymized Internet Traces - [dates used],\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n    Support for CAIDA's Internet Traces is provided by the National Science\n    Foundation, the US Department of Homeland Security, and\n    CAIDA Members.\n\n\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nThe equinix-chicago OC192 monitor setup:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago\n\nThe Day in the Life of the Internet project:\n    https://www.caida.org/projects/ditl/\n\nThe CoralReef Software Suite:\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/coralreef/\n\n\nMetadata\n--------\n\nThis section provides some more detailed information on various traces, specifically\non packet loss.\npkts_captured:       Total number of packets that was captured by hardware\npkts_lost_hw:        Number of packets the capturing hardware reported to have\n   lost. '>=' indicates that the loss between 2 packets in the traces was more\n   then the loss counter can accomodate (65535 packets).\npkts_lost_stripping: Number of packets removed from traces as result of payload stripping step\npkts_lost_anon:      Number of packets lost from traces as result of anonymization step\n\nNote that these numbers are the packet loss we can measure.\n\n---\n\nname:

In practice, mapping skitter-observed IP addresses into AS numbers\n    (using <a href=\"http://www.routeviews.org\">RouteViews</a>\n    BGP data)\n    involves potential distortion due to IP prefixes advertised by:\n    <ul>\n<li> AS-sets (an aggregated set of ASes advertises the\n\tprefix); </li>\n<li> multi-origin ASes, aka MOASes (several separate ASes\n\tadvertise the same prefix); </li>\n<li> no AS (some IP addresses appear in topology probes\n\tbut are not advertised by any AS). </li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>\n    The data files we provide here preserve all three effects listed\n    above and observed in actual measurements.  The data analyst\n    must decide (and make clear in explanations) how to process the\n    described exceptions, e.g., indirect links may be either discarded\n    or counted as real links.  The AS links data files also contain\n    information on the time of the probes and which skitter monitor\n    observed a particular link. The data file headers have further\n    details on the file format.  </p>\n<h3>\nNotes and Caveats\n</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\nSome skitter monitors take more than 24 hours\nto execute one cycle of probing addresses in their destination\nlists. Therefore, no single data file provides a complete view of\nthe topology observed by skitter since each data file is a result\nof aggregation over a 24-hour period only. For <a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/skitter-itdk/\">ITDK</a>,\nwe usually merge data for a period of approximately two to three weeks.\n</li>\n<li>\n       Trace files from the new skdriver-based skitter (from late Jun 2004\n       onward) are not necessarily aligned on day boundaries.  For example,\n       in the extreme case, if the cycle starting time is 11:59:59 PM on\n       Oct 1st, then the first trace file of the cycle will be named Oct 1st\n       even though almost all traces were taken on Oct 2nd.\n       Furthermore, different monitors start their cycles at different times.\n       Hence, the AS links file for a given day may be derived, in the worst\n       case, from a 48-hour period.  So even though AS links files are\n       produced separately for each day, the granularity of the analysis\n       should not be assumed to be a single day.\n</li>\n<li>\n       A former bug in the generation scripts caused some daily AS links\n       files to include more days of data than the nominal single day.  This\n       bug affected AS links files dated from late Jun 2004 to May 4, 2005,\n       which corresponds to about the first 11 months of the newer\n       skdriver-based skitter data set.\n<br>\n<br>\n       Around late Jun 2004, the naming of skitter files changed in response\n       to improvements in skitter itself.  In the past, traces were stored\n       in daily files based on timestamp, but starting around Jun 2004,\n       traces began to be organized instead by \"cycle\" (that is, a single\n       pass through a destination list).  A cycle has a starting time, which\n       is used to name the files containing the traces of that cycle.  For\n       various reasons, the traces of a cycle are split into multiple files\n       corresponding to consecutive non-overlapping 24-hour periods beginning\n       on the cycle starting time.  These files have a shared prefix\n       containing the date of the cycle starting time, and are differentiated\n       by a numeric suffix, starting with 000.  For example, the following\n       are the three files making up the cycle starting on 20050927 for the\n       m-root monitor:\n<br>\n<pre>\n         l006.m-root.20050927_000.arts\n         l006.m-root.20050927_001.arts\n         l006.m-root.20050927_002.arts\n</pre>\n\n       The file 20050927_001 corresponds to the second day of traces for this\n       cycle (that is, these traces were nominally collected on 20050928),\n       and similarly, 20050927_002 corresponds to the third day of traces\n       (that is, 20050929).\n<br>\n<br>\n       The bug caused the skitter AS links file for <b>each day</b> covered by a\n       cycle (that is, Sep 27th, 28th, and 29th for the above example)\n       to contain the AS links for <b>all the days</b> in the cycle.  The actual\n       AS links themselves are undistorted, so the main problem caused by\n       this bug is a slight decrease in the granularity of the data analysis\n       (coarsening from a <b>nominal</b> single day to several days [about 6 days\n       in the worst case]).\n</li>\n<li>\n       The dates in AS links filenames are in UTC, matching the UTC dates\n       in skitter trace files.\n</li>\n<li>\n       The time zone of the dates in the filenames of RouteViews BGP\n       snapshots changed from Pacific Time to UTC on Mar 4, 2003.  So\n       there is a slight mismatch between the dates of skitter files (UTC)\n       and BGP snapshots (Pacific Time) prior to this switchover in 2003,\n       although this shouldn't make much of a difference in the\n       appropriateness of the BGP snapshots selected for prefix-to-AS\n       mappings.\n</li>\n<li>\n    The first known link between two ASes is the only link\n    reported, so if both an indirect and a direct link between the\n    ASes was observed, and the indirect link was seen first, only\n    an indirect link between the ASes would be reported;  the direct\n    link is <b>not</b> reported.\n</li>\n<li>\n    The gap size reported is the first gap size observed for an\n    indirect link between two ASes.  If an indirect link with a\n    smaller gap size is observed, the smaller gap size is <b>not</b>\n    reported.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Acceptable Use Agreement</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Access to these data is subject to the terms of the following CAIDA Acceptable Use Agreement</b>\n(<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/about/legal/aua/caida_pub_aua.pdf\">printable version</a> in PDF format)<br>\n<textarea xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\" rows=\"20\" cols=\"100%\" readonly style=\"background-color:#eee;border:thin solid black;\">\nCAIDA ACCEPTABLE USE AGREEMENT for PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE DATASETS\n\nThe following terms comprise the Acceptable Use Policy and Data License Agreement for all publicly accessible datasets (the \"Public Agreement\") made available by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), a research unit at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and governed by The Regents of the University of California.\n\nLICENSE\n\nCAIDA's authorization to access the data grants You a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, and terminable license to copy, modify, and use the data in accordance with this Public Agreement.

Current AS Links data is available in the IPv4\nRouted /24 AS Links Dataset [3].\n\n*************\n\n\nThe Skitter AS Links Dataset has also been called AS Adjacencies.\n\nAs a part of the Macroscopic Topology Project, CAIDA posts the adjacency\nmatrix of the Internet AS-level graph computed daily from observed skitter\nmeasurements.\n\nAs a traceroute-based tool, skitter provides a view of Internet topology\nthat differs from those derived from BGP tables, e.g. RouteViews. Because\nskitter data reflects packets that have actually traversed a forward path\nto a destination, rather than paths calculated and propagated across the\nloosely coupled BGP system, it is more likely than BGP data in isolation to\nfaithfully correspond to IP topology. We note that while inherent\nlimitations of the traceroute-based probing methodology hinder\n100%-accurate extraction of the real Internet topology from skitter data,\nwe seek data sources that are collectively most likely to capture a precise\nand coherent snapshot of macroscopic Internet structure.\n\nIdeally, an AS-level graph would just list links between ASes. In practice,\nmapping skitter-observed IP addresses into AS numbers (using RouteViews BGP\ndata [4]) involves potential distortion due to IP prefixes advertised by:\n\n    * AS-sets (an aggregated set of ASes advertises the prefix);\n      multi-origin ASes, aka MOASes (several separate ASes advertise the\n      same prefix);\n    * no AS (some IP addresses appear in topology probes but are not\n    * advertised by any AS).\n\nThe data files we provide here preserve all three effects listed above and\nobserved in actual measurements. The data analyst must decide (and make\nclear in explanations) how to process the described exceptions, e.g.,\nindirect links may be either discarded or counted as real links. The AS\nlinks data files also contain information on the time of the probes and\nwhich skitter monitor observed a particular link. The data file headers\nhave further details on the file format. \n\nNotes and Caveats\n\n1.  Some skitter monitors take more than 24 hours to execute one cycle of\n    probing addresses in their destination lists. Therefore, no\n    single data file provides a complete view of the topology\n    observed by skitter since each data file is a result of aggregation\n    over a 24-hour period only. For ITDK, we usually merge data for\n    a period of approximately two to three weeks. Such merging of\n    the data files provided from this page can be performed by the\n    tool available in the download section (e.g. use script\n    asadj2graph.pl with the \"-u\" and \"-r\" options).\n\n2.  Trace files from the new skdriver-based skitter (from late Jun 2004\n    onward) are not necessarily aligned on day boundaries. For\n    example, in the extreme case, if the cycle starting time is\n    11:59:59 PM on Oct 1st, then the first trace file of the cycle\n    will be named Oct 1st even though almost all traces were taken\n    on Oct 2nd. Furthermore, different monitors start their cycles\n    at different times. Hence, the AS links file for a given day\n    may be derived, in the worst case, from a 48-hour period. So\n    even though AS links files are produced separately for each\n    day, the granularity of the analysis should not be assumed to\n    be a single day.\n\n3.  A former bug in the generation scripts caused some daily AS links\n    files to include more days of data than the nominal single day.\n    This bug affected AS links files dated from late Jun 2004 to\n    May 4, 2005, which corresponds to about the first 11 months of\n    the newer skdriver-based skitter data set.\n\n    Around late Jun 2004, the naming of skitter files changed in\n    response to improvements in skitter itself. In the past, traces\n    were stored in daily files based on timestamp, but starting\n    around Jun 2004, traces began to be organized instead by \"cycle\"\n    (that is, a single pass through a destination list). A cycle\n    has a starting time, which is used to name the files containing\n    the traces of that cycle. For various reasons, the traces of a\n    cycle are split into multiple files corresponding to consecutive\n    non-overlapping 24-hour periods beginning on the cycle starting\n    time. These files have a shared prefix containing the date of\n    the cycle starting time, and are differentiated by a numeric\n    suffix, starting with 000. For example, the following are the\n    three files making up the cycle starting on 20050927 for the\n    m-root monitor:\n\n               l006.m-root.20050927_000.arts\n               l006.m-root.20050927_001.arts\n               l006.m-root.20050927_002.arts\n\n    The file 20050927_001 corresponds to the second day of traces\n    for this cycle (that is, these traces were nominally collected\n    on 20050928), and similarly, 20050927_002 corresponds to the\n    third day of traces (that is, 20050929).\n\n    The bug caused the skitter AS links file for each day covered\n    by a cycle (that is, Sep 27th, 28th, and 29th for the above\n    example) to contain the AS links for all the days in the cycle.\n    The actual AS links themselves are undistorted, so the main\n    problem caused by this bug is a slight decrease in the granularity\n    of the data analysis (coarsening from a nominal single day to\n    several days [about 6 days in the worst case]).\n\n4.  The dates in AS links filenames are in UTC, matching the UTC dates in\n    skitter trace files.\n\n5.  The time zone of the dates in the filenames of RouteViews BGP\n    snapshots changed from Pacific Time to UTC on Mar 4, 2003. So\n    there is a slight mismatch between the dates of skitter files\n    (UTC) and BGP snapshots (Pacific Time) prior to this switchover\n    in 2003, although this shouldn't make much of a difference in\n    the appropriateness of the BGP snapshots selected for prefix-to-AS\n    mappings.\n\n6.  The first known link between two ASes is the only link reported,\n    so if both an indirect and a direct link between the ASes was\n    observed, and the indirect link was seen first, only an indirect\n    link between the ASes would be reported; the direct link is not\n    reported.\n\n7.  The gap size reported is the first gap size observed for an indirect\n    link between two ASes. If an indirect link with a smaller gap\n    size is observed, the smaller gap size is not reported.\n\n\n-------------------------\nData Format\n\nThe format of each AS links file is described within the header of\nthe file itself.\n\nThe directory structure is organized as YEAR/MONTH/FILE, where\nYEAR and MONTH are the year and month this cycle of data collection began, and\nthe filename is skitter_as_links.YYYYMMDD.gz, where YYYY is the year of\ndata collection, MM is the month, and DD is the date.\n\ne.g. 2000/01/skitter_as_links.20000102.gz\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n \nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nWhen referencing this data (as required by the AUA), please use:\n\n    The Skitter AS Links Dataset - <dates used>, Young Hyun,\n    Bradley Huffaker, Dan Andersen, Emile Aben, Matthew Luckie, k claffy, and Colleen Shannon\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/skitter_aslinks_dataset.\n\nAlso, please, report your publication to CAIDA\n(https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/publications/report-publication).\n\n\nThe CAIDA AS Links Dataset was sponsored by:\n--------------------------------------------\n\n    * DARPA\n    * National Science Foundation\n    * Department of Homeland Security\n    * WIDE Project\n    * Cisco Systems\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Skitter Topology Data:\n\thttps://www.caida.org/catalog/software/skitter/\n[2] Archipelago Project\n\thttps://www.caida.org/projects/ark/\t\n[3] IPv4 Routed /24 AS Links Dataset:\n\thttps://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/ipv4_routed_topology_aslinks_dataset/\n[4] University of Oregon RouteViews Project:\n\thttp://www.routeviews.org/\n\n"}],

Alternatively one could use the arts++ library and sk_analysis_dump (\nhttps://www.caida.org/catalog/software/skitter/sample_code/ ), but use of these\nis discouraged. These tools convert traces in arts format to easily parseable\ntext, which is helpful when doing analysis with perl scripts (since there is no\nperl interface to the arts++ library).\n\nThe skitter infrastructure underwent a significant upgrade at the end of\nJune 2004, with the following benefits:\n\n  1. The destination list can be any arbitrary size, independent of the\n     capacity of a given skitter monitor.\n\n     Previously, the largest destination list that could run on any given\n     monitor was strongly tied to the amount of physical memory available.\n     Many monitors have little memory, and this severely constrained the\n     size of the destination list that could be installed, which in turn,\n     reduced the number of destinations common to all monitors.  This\n     restriction no longer exists, allowing the set of destinations common\n     to all monitors to be as large as desired.\n\n  2. A skitter monitor can concurrently probe more than one destination\n     list.\n\n     This allows multiple destination lists geared toward different\n     investigations to be run simultaneously (albeit more slowly) on the\n     skitter monitors.  Lists are multiplexed at the granularity of\n     fixed-size segments (whose size can be different for different lists).\n     For example, the user can specify that two lists named A and B be\n     probed concurrently, with list A probed in segments of 50,000\n     destinations and list B in segments of 25,000 destinations.  Let L(n)\n     denote the nth segment of list L.  Then the sequence of probing might\n     be A(0), B(0), A(1), B(1), ... , A(k), B(k).\n\n  3. Skitter traces are tagged with a list ID and a cycle ID.\n\n     Previously, it was difficult for a researcher to determine to which\n     list and cycle a particular skitter trace belonged.  Some help was\n     available through the skitter status page\n     (http://sk-status.caida.org/cgi-bin/main.pl), but this page was\n     sometimes inaccurate.  As for determining the boundary between cycles,\n     researchers had to rely on a trick.\n\n     Every skitter trace in an arts file is now tagged with information\n     about the list and the cycle to which it belongs, in the form of a\n     list ID, a 4-byte integer, and a cycle ID, a UNIX timestamp.  Each\n     destination list is assigned a list ID by CAIDA, and a destination\n     list with a given ID will never change (that is, destination lists are\n     immutable).  Variations on a destination list will always be assigned\n     new list ID's to avoid confusion.\n\n     A \"cycle\", in skitter terminology, is a single pass through a\n     destination list.  Every trace now has a cycle ID associated with it,\n     and this ID approximately equals the UNIX timestamp of the first trace\n     in a given cycle.  Although all trace timestamps are guaranteed to\n     occur at or after the the cycle timestamp, it is perfectly legal and\n     common for the cycle timestamp to precede the first trace timestamp by\n     a short period (by no more than a minute in the vast majority of\n     cases).\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n\nSkitter traces are available under three subdirectories---skitter-old,\nskitter-by-name, and skitter-by-number.\n\nThe subdirectory skitter-old contains traces collected prior to the\nrevamping of the skitter infrastructure in late June 2004.  These arts\nfiles do not contain list ID's or cycle ID's, and the directory structure\nis not organized by list or cycle.  Specifically, the general form of the\ndirectory structure is as follows:\n\n  skitter-old/<monitor>/<year>/<month>/<monitor>.<YYYYMMDD>.arts[.gz]\n\nFor example:\n\n  skitter-old/mwest/2004/06/mwest.20040616.arts\n\nThe <YYYYMMDD> date, which is in GMT, is derived from the trace timestamp\n(the timestamp of the moment when a trace toward a given destination was\nstarted).\n\nThe remaining subdirectories, skitter-by-name and skitter-by-number,\ncontain traces collected after the revamping of the skitter infrastructure\nin late June 2004.  Both directories contain the same data; they simply\ndiffer slightly in organization at the top-most level.  The skitter-by-name\ndirectory organizes data by list name, while skitter-by-number organizes\ndata by numeric list ID.  See the file 'list-names.txt' for the mapping from\nnumeric list ID's to list names.  The general form of the skitter-by-name\nand skitter-by-number directories is as follows:\n\n  skitter-by-name/<list-name>/<monitor>/\\\n       <year>/<month>/l<list-id>.<monitor>.<YYYYMMDD>_<period>.arts[.gz]\n\n  skitter-by-number/list-<list-id>/<monitor>/\\\n       <year>/<month>/l<list-id>.<monitor>.<YYYYMMDD>_<period>.arts[.gz]\n\nFor example, (the list 'ipv4.20040120.0971k' has ID 6):\n\n  skitter-by-name/ipv4.20040120.0971k/mwest/\\\n       2004/07/l006.mwest.20040715_000.arts\n\n  skitter-by-number/list-006/mwest/2004/07/l006.mwest.20040715_000.arts\n\nThe <YYYYMMDD> date, which is in GMT, is derived from the *cycle*\ntimestamp, unlike for the 'skitter-old' directory, in which this date is\nderived from the *trace* timestamp.  The <period> following the date needs\nsome further explanation.  Each <period> value represents a 24-hour period\nfollowing the start of the cycle (the actual cycle timestamp and not just\nthe <YYYYMMDD> of the timestamp; that is, if the cycle started on 20040715\n17:00, then the first 24-hour period spans 20040715 17:00 to 20040716\n16:59).  So, the traces collected in the first 24-hour period of the cycle\nwill be found in the file named *_000; the traces from the second 24-hour\nperiod will be found in the file named *_001; and so.  This decomposition\nof a single cycle into multiple files is done to make backing up easier.\nIf you prefer, you may simply concatenate these separate files together to\nget one arts file per cycle; that is, the arts format allows you to do the\nfollowing:\n\n  cat mwest/2004/07/l006.mwest.20040715_*.arts >mwest.20040715.arts\n\nThe resulting concatenated arts file is a valid arts file.\n\n%%% END OF FILE\n\n"}],

The total size of the dataset is 69 GB (16, 19 and 34 GB for each\nof the three days). The pcap files only contain packet headers; payload  \nhas been removed.

Because there is little legitimate traffic\nin this address space, the network telescope provides us with a\nmonitoring point for anomalous traffic that represents almost 1/256th\nof all IPv4 destination addresses on the Internet.\n\nA network telescope (aka a black hole, an Internet sink, or a\ndarknet) typically has few or often no real computers attached to\nit and carries almost no legitimate traffic. It serves research\nvalue as a monitoring point for anomalous traffic which comprises\na significant portion of Internet activity. The network telescope\nmay capture phenomena from a wide range of events, including\nmisconfiguration, malicious scanning of address space, backscatter\nfrom random source denial-of-service attacks, and automated spread\nof malicious software. [2, 3, 4] The network telescope is thus a\ntool to help researchers identify root causes of this anomalous\ntraffic and has already proven successful in uncovering denial-of-service\nattack victims and tracking the automated spread of worms.\n\nWhile researchers at CAIDA and in the network security community\nare still working to identify the sources of the misconfigurations\nand other human errors that send traffic into the network telescope,\nthe utility of network telescopes for identifying denial-of-service\nattack victims and tracking the spread of Internet worms has been\nmore thoroughly explored.\n\nDataset Contents\n----------------\n\nThis dataset contains data from the UCSD Network Telescope [1] for\nthree days between November 2008 and January 2009 exactly one month apart.\nThe first day (21 November 2008) covers the onset of the Conficker A\ninfection [5, 6]. On the second day, 21 December 2008, only Conficker A was\nactive; and during the third and final day both Conficker A and B were active.\nPlease, note that these are \"raw\" traces: no attempt has been made to identify or\nfilter any packets as specifically Conficker-related.\n\nThis dataset contains compressed pcap files each containing one hour\nof traces. Each day has 24 hourly files, With the exception of 21 November\nwhich only has 20 pcap files (there are no data between 20:00 UT and 24:00 UT\non that day). The total size of the dataset is 69 GB (16, 19 and 34GB for each\nof the three days, respectively).\n\nNote that the CAIDA UCSD Network Telescope Dataset \"Two days in November 2008\"\n(https://catalog.caida.org/details/dataset/telescope_anon_twodays),\nwith traces for 12 and 19 November 2008, contains two typical days of \"background\nradiation\" as seen by the Network Telescope just prior to the detection of\nConficker A. That dataset has been processed the same way as this Conficker\ndataset (see below), and can be useful in differentiating Conficker-infected\ntraffic from \"clean\" background radiation.\n\nCreation process\n----------------\n\nWe modified these three days of telescope traffic in three ways:\n\n1. We removed the packets from legitimate IP addresses (typically\n   slightly less than one percent of the packets).\n\n2. We removed non-IPv4 packets (less than 0.01 percent of all packets).\n\n3. We zeroed out the leading 8 bits of the destination IP addresses.\n\n4. Only layers up to protocol layer 4 are retained (payload is stripped\n   using crl_to_pcap -l4).\n\nNo portion of the CAIDA Dataset \"Three Days of Conficker Traffic from the UCSD Network\nTelescope\" may be redistributed.\n\n\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nWhen referencing this dataset (as required by the AUA), please use:\n    The CAIDA UCSD \"Three Days of Conficker Traffic from the UCSD Network Telescope\" Dataset\n    https://catalog.caida.org/details/dataset/telescope_anon_conficker\n\nUsers are encouraged to include the following attribution in the\nacknowledgments section of their document:\n\n    Support for this dataset and the UCSD Network Telescope are provided\n    by Cisco Systems, Limelight Networks, the US Department of\n    Homeland Security, the National Science Foundation, and\n    CAIDA, Digital Envoy, and CAIDA Members.\n\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nFor more information on the Conficker Worm, see:\n    ISS Vulnerability:\n      http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS08-067.mspx\n    Conficker Analysis:\n      https://www.caida.org/archive/ms08-067/conficker\n\nFor more information on the UCSD Network Telescope, see:\n    https://www.caida.org/projects/network_telescope/\n\n\nThe CAIDA \"Three Days of Conficker Traffic from the UCSD Network Telescope\" Dataset\nwas sponsored by:\n\n    Cisco Systems, Inc\n    Limelight Networks\n    The US Department of Homeland Security\n    The National Science Foundation\n    Digital Envoy\n    CAIDA Members\n\nSpecial thanks to Brian Kantor at UCSD CSE and Jim Madden at UCSD\nACT for support of the UCSD Network Telescope Project.\n\n\nReferences\n=============\n\n[1] The UCSD Network Telescope \n    https://www.caida.org/projects/network_telescope/\n\n[2] DeBaecke, D., \"Denial of Service Tools and Techniques\", University of Memphis 2006\n    http://umdrive.memphis.edu/ddebaeck/public/Denial%20of%20Service%20Tools%20and%20Techniques.ppt\n\n[3] Rajab, M., Monrose, F., Terzis, A., \"Worm Evolution Tracking\n    via Timing Analysis\", ACM WORM 2006\n\n[4] Zesheng Chen; Chuanyi Ji, \"Measuring Network-Aware Worm Spreading\n    Ability\", INFOCOM 2007. 26th IEEE International Conference on\n    Computer Communications.

The first version of the worm uses a static seed for it's\nrandom number generator. Then, around 10:00 UTC in the morning of July\n19th, 2001, a random seed variant of the Code-Red worm (CRv2) appeared\nand spread. This second version shared almost all of its code with the\nfirst version, but spread much more rapidly. Next, on August 4th, a new\nworm began to infect machines exploiting the same vulnerability in\nMicrosoft's IIS webserver as the original Code-Red virus. Although the\nnew worm had no relationship to the first one outside of exploiting the\nsame vulnerability, it contained in its source code the string\n\"CodeRedII\" and was thus named CodeRed II.  Finally, on September 18,\n2001, the Nimda worm began to spread via backdoors left by CodeRedII,\nas well as via email, open network shares, and compromised web sites.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nThis dataset contains information useful for studying the spread of the\n<b>Code-Red version 2</b>, and <b>CodeRedII</b> worms.

These three data sources are used to maximize\n\tcoverage of the expansion of the worm.  Between midnight and\n\t16:30 UTC, a passive network monitor recorded headers of all\n\tpackets destined for the /8 research network.  After 16:30 UTC,\n\ta filter installed on a campus router to reduce congestion\n\tcaused by the worm blocked all external traffic to this\n\tnetwork. Because this filter was put into place upstream of the\n\tmonitor, we were unable to capture IP packet headers after\n\t16:30 UTC.  However, a second UCSD data set consisting of\n\tsampled netflow output from the filtering router was available\n\tat the UCSD site throughout the 24 hour period.  Vern Paxson\n\tprovided probe information collected by Bro on the LBL networks\n\tbetween 10:00 UTC on July 19, 2001 and 7:00 on July 20, 2001.\n\tWe have merged these three sources into to produce the Code-Red\n\tJuly dataset.\n\n    </blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Code-Red August</b>:\n    <blockquote>\n\tThe data source for this dataset includes only packet headers\n\tcollected by a passive monitor on a /8 network at UCSD (the\n\tUCSD Network Telescope).

The first version of the worm uses a static seed\nfor it's random number generator. Then, around 10:00 UTC in the\nmorning of July 19th, 2001, a random seed variant of the Code-Red\nworm (CRv2) appeared and spread. This second version shared almost\nall of its code with the first version, but spread much more rapidly.\nNext, on August 4th, a new worm began to infect machines exploiting\nthe same vulnerability in Microsoft's IIS webserver as the original\nCode-Red virus. Although the new worm had no relationship to the\nfirst one outside of exploiting the same vulnerability, it contained\nin its source code the string \"CodeRedII\" and was thus named CodeRed\nII.  Finally, on September 18, 2001, the Nimda worm began to spread\nvia backdoors left by CodeRedII, as well as via email, open network\nshares, and compromised web sites.\n\nThis dataset contains information useful for studying the spread\nof the Code-Red version 2, and CodeRedII worms. The dataset consists\nof a publicly available set of files that contain summarized\ninformation that does not individually identify infected computers.\n\n----\nData:\n----\nData included in the Code-Red Dataset includes:\n\nPublicly Available:\n    Code-Red July: the first Code-Red version 2 outbreak (July 19-20, 2001)\n\t- distribution of start and end times of hosts performing port 80\n\t  TCP SYN scanning\n\t- distribution of durations of time code-redv2-infected computers\n\t  were observed to be scanning\n\t- country distribution of code-redv2-infected computers\n\t- a file containing a table with the following eight tab-separated\n\t  fields for each observed IP address: start time, end time,\n\t  top-level domain, country, latitude, longitude, AS number, and\n\t  AS name \n\n    Code-Red August: the second Code-Red version 2 outbreak and beginning\n        of the spread of the CodeRedII worm (August 1-20, 2001)\n\t- distribution of start and end times of hosts performing port 80\n\t  TCP SYN scanning\n\t- distribution of durations of time code-redv2-infected computers\n\t  were observed to be scanning\n\t- country distribution of code-redv2-infected computers\n\t- a file containing a table with the following seven tab-separated\n\t  fields for each observed IP address: start time, end time,\n\t  top-level domain, country, latitude, longitude, AS number \n\n\n*** No portion of the CAIDA Dataset on the Code-Red Worms may be redistributed.\n\n------------------------\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------\n\nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nWhen referencing this data (as required by the AUA), please use:\n\n    The CAIDA Dataset on the Code-Red Worms - July and August 2001,\n    https://catalog.caida.org/details/dataset/telescope_codered_worm.\n\nAlso please report your publication to CAIDA\n(https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/publications/report-publication)\n\n----------------\nMore Information:\n----------------\nFor more information on the Code-Red-related worms (Code-Redv1,\n    Code-Redv2, CodeRedII), see:\n\n    .ida Vulnerability:\n          http://www.eeye.com/html/Research/Advisories/AD20010618.html\n\n    Code-Red Worms\n          o https://www.caida.org/analysis/security/code-red/#crv1\n          o https://www.caida.org/analysis/security/code-red/#crv2\n          o https://www.caida.org/analysis/security/code-red/#crii\n\n    Code-Red version 2 Spread Analysis\n          https://www.caida.org/analysis/security/code-red/coderedv2_analysis\n\n\nFor more information on the UCSD Network Telescope, see:\n\thttps://www.caida.org/projects/network_telescope/#worm\n\thttps://www.caida.org/analysis/security/telescope/\n\n\n---------------\nAcknowledgments:\n---------------\nThe CAIDA Dataset on the Code-Red Worms was sponsored by:\n\tCisco Systems, Inc\n\tThe US Department of Homeland Security\n\tThe National Science Foundation\n\tThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\n\tCAIDA Members\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Brian Kantor, Jim Madden, and Pat Wilson at UCSD\nand Barry Greene at Cisco for support of the UCSD Network Telescope\nProject.

It \ncontains few legitimate hosts; inbound traffic to non-existent machines - so\ncalled <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_background_noise\">\nInternet Background Radiation (IBR)</a> - is unsolicited and results \nfrom a wide range of events, including misconfiguration (e.g. mistyping an IP\naddress), scanning of address space by attackers or malware looking for\nvulnerable targets, backscatter from randomly spoofed denial-of-service\nattacks, and the automated spread of malware. CAIDA continously captures \nthis anomalous traffic discarding the legitimate traffic packets\ndestined to the few reachable IP addresses in this prefix. We archive and\naggregate these data, and provide this valuable resource to network security \nresearchers. \n</paragraph>\n</div>\n<p>\nTo generate this RSDoS Attack Metadata dataset, we process 5-minute intervals of the\n<a href=\"../passive/telescope-near-real-time_dataset\">raw telescope data</a> extracting\nthe response packets sent by victims of randomly and uniformly spoofed \nDenial-of-Service attacks (<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/projects/network_telescope/\">backscatter packets</a>). Activity that related to the\nsame victim is summarized in an 'attack vector', following the definitions and\nmethodology described by \n<a href=\"https://catalog.caida.org/details/paper/2006_backscatter_dos/\">\n\tMoore <i>et al.</i></a> (2006).\nWe continue to update the attack vectors as long as related activity is \nstill observed. \n</p>\n<p>\n\nOnce an attack completed, we record the accumulated statistics. We also \ngeolocate the targeted IP address using \n<a href=\"https://www.digitalelement.com/solutions/netacuity-edge-premium/\"><i>NetAcuity Edge Premium Edition</i></a> data and determine its origin AS using \n<i>Routeviews Prefix-to-AS mappings</i>\n(<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/routeviews-prefix2as\">pfx2as</a>) data.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor each day, the RSDoS dataset has a single compressed CSV file of attack vectors. Each\nattack vector is uniquely identified by the target IP address and the attack\nstart timestamp. Each record contains the following fields:\n<ul>\n<li> The IP address of the attack victim (target_ip)</li>\n<li> The number of distinct attacker IPs in the attack</li>\n<li> The number of distinct attacker ports</li>\n<li> The number of distinct target ports</li>\n<li> The cumulative total number of packets observed in the attack</li>\n<li> The cumulative total number of bytes seen for the attack</li>\n<li> The maximum packet rate (of backscatter packets) seen in the attack, as a moving average per minute</li>\n<li> The timestamp of the first observed packet of the attack</li>\n<li> The timestamp of the last observed packet of the attack</li>\n<li> The autonomous system number of target_ip at the time of the attack</li>\n<li> Country geolocation of target_ip, at the time of the attack</li>\n<li> Continent geolocation of target_ip, at the time of the attack</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<xhtmlcode>\n<h3>\nCaveats that apply to this dataset\n</h3>\n<p>\nThis dataset and the types of worm and denial-of-service attack traffic \ncontained therein are representative only of some spoofed source \ndenial-of-service attacks. Many denial-of-service attackers do not spoof source\nIP addresses when they attack their victim, in which case backscatter would not\nappear on a telescope. Attackers can also spoof in a non-random fashion, which\nwill incur an uneven distribution of backscatter across the IPv4 address space,\nand may cause backscatter traffic to miss any telescope lenses. Note that the \ntelescope does not send any packets in response, which also limits insight into\nthe traffic it sees.\n</p>\n</xhtmlcode>\n<h3>Data Access Policy</h3>\n<p>\n<b><i><font color=\"red\">These data must be analyzed on CAIDA machines, and\ncannot be downloaded!</font></i></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Academic researchers and US government agencies</b> can request access\nthrough CAIDA by filling out and submitting the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/request_user_info_forms/telescope-near-real-time_dataset_request\">\nonline form.</a> It usually takes about five  to ten business days to process\nyour request.

As a tradeoff, we increment\nthe flow tuple counter when (a) the destination ip address was never previously\nscanned or (b) the source port used to scan the destination ip differs from the\nprevious entry.\n\nThus the number of flows is less than or equal to the number of entries in the\nflowtuple file, and greater than or equal to the actual number of unique values.\n\n^^ Conficker scans IP addresses A.B.C.D where B<128 and D<128.\n\n^^^ We convert each scanned IP address UCSD.B.C.D to a number:\nB*256*256+C*256+D\n\n* Scanning Strategy Heuristics\n\nThe entries in the hourly file should help identify a scanning methodology.\nFor more information see the appendix of my dissertation.\n\n* Referencing this dataset\n\nWhen referencing this data (as required by the AUA), please use:\n\n    The CAIDA UCSD Telescope Darknet Scanners  Dataset;,\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/telescope-darknet-scanners_dataset/.\n\n"}],

It \ncontains few legitimate hosts; inbound traffic to non-existent machines - so\ncalled <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_background_noise\">\nInternet Background Radiation (IBR)</a> - is unsolicited and results \nfrom a wide range of events, including misconfiguration (e.g. mistyping an IP\naddress), scanning of address space by attackers or malware looking for\nvulnerable targets, backscatter from randomly spoofed denial-of-service\nattacks, and the automated spread of malware. CAIDA continously captures \nthis anomalous traffic discarding the legitimate traffic packets\ndestined to the few reachable IP addresses in this prefix. We archive and\naggregate these data, and provide this valuable resource to network security \nresearchers. \n</paragraph>\n</div>\n<p>\nThis dataset represents raw traffic traces captured by the Telescope\ninstrumentation and made available in near-real time as one-hour long \ncompressed pcap files. We collect more than 3 TB of uncompressed IBR traffic traces data per day.\n The most recent 14 days of data \nare stored locally at CAIDA.\nOnce data slides out of ths \"near-real-time window\", the pcap files are\noff-loaded to a tape storage. This historical Telescope data starting from\n2008 \nare available by additional request.\n</p>\n<xhtmlcode>\n<h3>\nCaveats that apply to this dataset\n</h3>\n<p>\nThis dataset and the types of worm and denial-of-service attack traffic \ncontained therein are representative only of some spoofed source \ndenial-of-service attacks. Many denial-of-service attackers do not spoof source\nIP addresses when they attack their victim, in which case backscatter would not\nappear on a telescope. Attackers can also spoof in a non-random fashion, which\nwill incur an uneven distribution of backscatter across the IPv4 address space,\nand may cause backscatter traffic to miss any telescope lenses. Note that the \ntelescope does not send any packets in response, which also limits insight into\nthe traffic it sees.\n</p>\n</xhtmlcode>\n<xhtmlcode>\n<h3>Data Access Policy</h3>\n<p>\n<b><i><font color=\"red\">These data must be analyzed on CAIDA machines, and \ncannot be downloaded!</font></i></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Academic researchers and US government agencies</b> can request access\nthrough CAIDA by filling out and submitting the\n<a href=\"https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/request_user_info_forms/telescope-near-real-time_dataset_request\">\nonline form.</a> It usually takes about five  to ten business days to process\nyour request.

They are used for spamming, phishing, denial of service\nattacks, brute-force cracking, stealing private information, and cyber warfare. Botnets carry out network scans for several\nreasons, including searching for vulnerable machines to infect and recruit into the botnet, probing networks for enumeration or penetration, etc. We present the measurement and analysis of a horizontal scan of the entire IPv4 address space conducted by the Sality botnet in February 2011. This 12-day scan originated from approximately 3 million distinct IP addresses, and used a heavily coordinated and unusually covert scanning strategy to try to discover and compromise VoIP-related (SIP server) infrastructure. </p>\n<p>We observed this event through the UCSD Network Telescope, a /8 darknet continuously receiving large amounts of unsolicited traffic, and we correlate this traffic data with other public sources of data to validate our inferences. Sality is one of the largest botnets ever identified by researchers, its behavior represents ominous advances in the evolution of modern malware: the use of more sophisticated stealth scanning strategies by millions of coordinated bots, targeting critical\nvoice communications infrastructure. This work offers a detailed dissection of the botnet\u201bs scanning behavior, including general methods to correlate, visualize, and extrapolate botnet behavior across the global Internet.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"keywordlist\">\t    \n            Keywords: measurement methodology, network telescope, security\t  </div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear:both; height: 2em;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}, {"name": "README.txt", "format": "text", "content": "Title: Sipscan Public Release Dataset\nFile: sipscan.release_dataset.gz\nThumbnail: None\nCaption:\n\nThe sipscan release dataset contains detailed information about each UDP probing\npacket captured by the UCSD Network Telescope over the course of the event. Each\nrow in the file represents one packet. Fields include the time the packet was\nreceived, results of geographic mapping of the source IP (country code, latitude\nand longitude), Autonomous System Number, source and destination address\nidentifiers, and source port.  The source addresses have been anonymized by\nmapping each address to a unique identifier, maintaining a one-to-one mapping\nbetween original IP and anonymized identifier. Destination addresses have had\nthe most-significant octet changed to protect the identity of the /8 network\nused by the UCSD Network Telescope.  The geographic and AS information for each\npacket can be used to reproduce the visualizations and tables presented in the\npaper, and the source port can be used to carry out the 'port unrolling'\ntechnique.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n------------------------------\n \nThe AUA that you accepted when you were given access to these datas is included\nin pdf format as a separate file in the same directory as this README file.\n\nWhen referencing this data (as required by the AUA), please use:\n\n    The CAIDA UCSD Network Telescope on the Sipscan Dataset,\n    https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/sipscan_dataset \n\nor reference the publication\n\n    A.
