     "description": "Mutually Agreed Norms on Routing Security (MANRS) 
is an industry-led initiative to improve Internet routing security by 
encouraging participating networks to implement a series of mandatory or
 recommended actions. MANRS members must register their IP prefixes in a
 trusted routing database and use such information to prevent 
propagation of invalid routing information. MANRS membership has 
increased significantly in recent years, but the impact of the MANRS 
initiative on the overall Internet routing security remains unclear. In 
this paper, we provide the first independent look into the MANRS 
ecosystem by using publicly available data to analyze the routing 
behavior of participant networks. We quantify MANRS participants' level 
of conformance with the stated requirements, and compare the behavior of
 MANRS and non-MANRS networks. While not all MANRS members fully comply 
with all required actions, we find that they are more likely to 
implement routing security practices described in MANRS actions. We 
assess the relevance of the MANRS effort in securing the overall routing
 ecosystem. We found that as of May 2022, over 83% of MANRS networks 
were conformant to the route filtering requirement by dropping BGP 
messages with invalid information according to authoritative records, 
and over 95% were conformant to the routing information facilitation 
requirement, registering their resources in authoritative databases."

     "description": "We analyze the properties of 712 prefixes that 
appeared in Spamhaus’ Don’t Route Or Peer (DROP) list over a nearly 
three-year period from June 2019 to March 2022. We show that attackers 
are subverting multiple defenses against malicious use of address space,
 including creating fraudulent Internet Routing Registry records for 
prefixes shortly before using them. Other attackers disguised their 
activities by announcing routes with spoofed origin ASes consistent with
 historic route announcements, and in one case, with the ASN in a Route 
Origin Authorization. We quantify the substantial and actively-exploited
 attack surface in unrouted address space, which warrants 
reconsideration of RPKI eligibility restrictions by RIRs, and 
reconsideration of AS0 policies by both operators and RIRs."

     "description": "The hostilities in Ukraine have driven 
unprecedented forces, both from third-party countries and in Russia, to 
create economic barriers. In the Internet, these manifest both as 
internal pressures on Russian sites to (re-)patriate the infrastructure 
they depend on (e.g., naming and hosting) and external pressures arising
 from Western providers disassociating from some or all Russian 
customers. While quite a bit has been written about this both from a 
policy perspective and anecdotally, our paper places the question on an 
empirical footing and directly measures longitudinal changes in the 
makeup of naming, hosting and certificate issuance for domains in the 
Russian Federation."

Hijacking"

     "description": "In 2019, the US Department of Homeland Security 
issued an emergency warning about _DNS infrastructure tampering_. This 
alert, in response to a series of attacks against foreign government 
websites, highlighted how a sophisticated attacker could leverage access
 to key DNS infrastructure to then hijack traffic and harvest valid 
login credentials for target organizations. However, even armed with 
this knowledge, identifying the existence of such incidents has been 
almost entirely via post hoc forensic reports (i.e., after a breach was 
found via some other method). Indeed, such attacks are particularly 
challenging to detect because they can be very short lived, bypass the 
protections of TLS and DNSSEC, and are imperceptible to users. 
Identifying them retroactively is even more complicated by the lack of 
fine-grained Internet-scale forensic data. This paper is a first attempt
 to make progress at this latter goal. Combining a range of longitudinal
 data from Internet-wide scans, passive DNS records, and Certificate 
Transparency logs, we have constructed a methodology for identifying 
potential victims of sophisticated DNS infrastructure hijacking and have
 used it to identify a range of victims (primarily government agencies),
 both those named in prior reporting, and others previously unknown."

     "description": "The Internet's naming system (DNS) is a 
hierarchically structured database, with hundreds of millions of domains
 in a radically distributed management architecture. The distributed 
nature of the DNS is the primary factor that allowed it to scale to its 
current size, but it also brings security and stability risks. The 
Internet standards community (IETF) has published several operational 
best practices to improve DNS resilience, but operators must make their 
own decisions that tradeoff security, cost, and complexity. Since these 
decisions can impact the security of billions of Internet users, 
recently ICANN has proposed an initiative to codify best practices into a
 set of global norms to improve security: the Knowledge-Sharing and 
Instantiating Norms for DNS and Naming Security (KINDNS). A similar 
effort for routing security – Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security
 – provided inspiration for this effort. The MANRS program encourages 
operators to voluntarily commit to a set of practices that will improve 
collective routing security – a challenge when incentives to conform 
with these practices does not generate a clear return on investment for 
operators. One challenge for both initiatives is independent 
verification of conformance with the practices. The KINDNS conversation 
has just started, and stakeholders are still debating what should be in 
the set of practices. At this early stage, we analyze possible best 
practices in terms of their measurability by third parties, including a 
review of DNS measurement studies and available data sets."

target core Internet infrastructures and services, including the Domain 
Name System (DNS). To characterize recent DDoS attacks against 
authoritative DNS infrastructure, we join two existing data sets – DoS 
activity inferred from a sizable darknet, and contemporaneous DNS 
measurement data – for a 17-month period (Nov. 20 - Mar. 22). Our 
measurements reveal evidence that millions of domains (up to 5% of the 
DNS namespace) experienced a DoS attack during our observation window. 
Most attacks did not substantially harm DNS performance, but in some 
cases we saw 100-fold increases in DNS resolution time, or complete 
unreachability. Our measurements captured a devastating attack against a
 large provider in the Netherlands (TransIP), and attacks against 
Russian infrastructure. Our data corroborates the value of known best 
practices to improve DNS resilience to attacks, including the use of 
anycast and topological redundancy in nameserver infrastructure. We 
discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our data sets for DDoS tracking 
and impact on the DNS, and promising next steps to improve our 
understanding of the evolving DDoS ecosystem."

Traffic"

     "datePublished": "2022.10",

     "description": "Unsolicited network traffic captured by network 
telescopes, namely darknet traffic, provides important data for studying
 malicious Internet activities, such as network scanning, the spread of 
malware, and DDoS attacks. Inferring such activity in traffic often 
requires first obtaining fingerprints of the activity and searching 
historical traffic traces (e.g, pcaps) for that pattern. Traffic volume 
at the largest darknets can exceed 100GB/hour, rendering it challenging 
to process at the packet level. Aggregated flow-based metadata can 
reduce computation, storage and I/O overhead at the expense of 
finer-grained information about the traffic. Customized data structures 
and streaming algorithms offer an alternative approach to extracting 
information from raw packets, but they are typically traffic tailored 
for estimating specific metrics and thus limited in their ability to 
detect a wide range of events. We propose a machine learning (ML)-based 
framework to detect events by characterizing traffic dynamics across 
many time series generated from raw traffic processed by the Corsaro 
software package. Our method extracts signals of attacks in time-series 
statistics that can reveal promising time periods in which to further 
investigate an attack using raw packet traces."

Internet Domain Name System from the proposed revision of the European 
Union’s Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive. The European 
Union NIS-2 Directive replaces the original network and information 
systems (NIS Directive) from 2016, to account for (among other things) 
the changing character of the digital society and the increased need for
 improved cybersecurity. Quoting the directive: \r\n\r\n\u003e The NIS 
Directive is not sufficiently clear when it comes to the scope for 
operators of essential services and its provisions do not provide 
sufficient clarity regarding national competence over digital service 
providers. \r\n\r\nThe directive imposes general requirements on 
providers of network and information services, if deemed _critical_ or 
_important_, including vulnerability reporting, risk assessment, 
operating their systems at a level of security consistent with assessed 
risk, and attention to supply chain issues and third-party 
relationships. The legislation also imposes specific obligations on 
providers of DNS services in the EU (including registries and 
registrars) to maintain complete and accurate registration data 
(sometimes known as ”Know Your Customer” or KYC obligations), and share 
this data in a timely manner to ”legitimate access seekers”. Some 
smaller providers are exempt, but providers of electronic communications
 networks or of publicly available electronic communications services, 
trust service providers, and Top-level domain name (TLD) name registries
 are obligated under this legislation, independent of size. This memo 
examines the sections of the Directive that relate to DNS operation and 
security."

     "description": "Large-scale Internet scans are a common method to 
identify victims of a specific attack. Stateless scanning like in ZMap 
has been established as an efficient approach to probing at Internet 
scale. Stateless scans, however, need a second phase to perform the 
attack. This remains invisible to network telescopes, which only capture
 the first incoming packet, and is not observed as a related event by 
honeypots, either. In this work, we examine Internet-wide scan traffic 
through Spoki, a reactive network telescope operating in real-time that 
we design and implement. Spoki responds to asynchronous TCP SYN packets 
and engages in TCP handshakes initiated in the second phase of two-phase
 scans. Because it is extremely lightweight it scales to large prefixes 
where it has the unique opportunity to record the first data sequence 
submitted within the TCP handshake ACK. We analyze two-phase scanners 
during a three months period using globally deployed Spoki reactive 
telescopes as well as flow data sets from IXPs and ISPs. We find that a 
predominant fraction of TCP SYNs on the Internet has irregular 
characteristics. Our findings also provide a clear signature of today’s 
scans as: (i) highly targeted, (ii) scanning activities notably vary 
between regional vantage points, and (iii) a significant share 
originates from malicious sources."

authoritative name servers to study the reactions of domain owners 
affected by the 2016 DDoS attack on Dyn. We use industry sources of 
information about domain names to study the influence of factors such as
 industry sector and website popularity on the willingness of domain 
managers to invest in high availability of online services. 
Specifically, we correlate business characteristics of domain owners 
with their resilience strategies in the wake of DoS attacks affecting 
their domains. Our analysis revealed correlations between two properties
 of domains – industry sector and popularity – and post-attack 
strategies. Specifically, owners of more popular domains were more 
likely to re-act to increase the diversity of their authoritative DNS 
service for their domains. Similarly, domains in certain industry 
sectors were more likely to seek out such diversity in their DNS 
service. For example, domains categorized as General News were nearly 6 
times more likely to re-act than domains categorized as Internet 
Services. Our results can inform managed DNS and other network service 
providers regarding the potential impact of downtime on their customer 
portfolio."

     "description": "The goal of this article is to offer framing for 
conversations about the role of measurement in informing public policy 
about the Internet. We review different stakeholders’ approaches to 
measurements and associated challenges, including the activities of U.S.
 government agencies. We show how taxonomies of existing harms can 
facilitate the search for clarity along the fraught path from 
identifying to measuring harms. Looking forward, we identify barriers to
 advancing our empirical grounding of Internet infrastructure to inform 
policy, societal challenges that create pressure to overcome these 
barriers, and steps that could facilitate measurement to support 
policymaking."

     "description": "The Internet has become a critical component of 
modern civilization requiring scientific exploration akin to endeavors 
to understand the land, sea, air, and space environments. Understanding 
the baseline statistical distributions of traffic are essential to the 
scientific understanding of the Internet. Correlating data from 
different Internet observatories and outposts can be a useful tool for 
gaining insights into these distributions. This work compares observed 
sources from the largest Internet telescope (the CAIDA darknet 
telescope) with those from a commercial outpost (the GreyNoise 
honeyfarm). Neither of these locations actively emit Internet traffic 
and provide distinct observations of unsolicited Internet traffic 
(primarily botnets and scanners). Newly developed GraphBLAS hyperspace 
matrices and D4M associative array technologies enable the efficient 
analysis of these data on significant scales. The CAIDA sources are well
 approximated by a Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution. Over a 6-month period 
70% of the brightest (highest frequency) sources in the CAIDA telescope 
are consistently detected by coeval observations in the GreyNoise 
honeyfarm. This overlap drops as the sources dim (reduce frequency) and 
as the time difference between the observations grows. The probability 
of seeing a CAIDA source is proportional to the logarithm of the 
brightness. The temporal correlations are well described by a modified 
Cauchy distribution. These observations are consistent with a correlated
 high frequency beam of sources that drifts on a time scale of a month."

     "description": "We investigate a novel approach to the use of 
jitter to infer network congestion using data collected by probes in 
access networks. We discovered a set of features in jitter and jitter 
dispersion —a jitter- derived time series we define in this paper— time 
series that are characteristic of periods of congestion. We leverage 
these concepts to create a jitter-based congestion inference framework 
that we call Jitterbug. We apply Jitterbug’s capabilities to a wide 
range of traffic scenarios and discover that Jitterbug can correctly 
identify both recurrent and one-off congestion events. We validate 
Jitterbug inferences against state-of-the- art autocorrelation-based 
inferences of recurrent congestion. We find that the two approaches have
 strong congruity in their inferences, but Jitterbug holds promise for 
detecting one-off as well as recurrent congestion. We identify several 
future directions for this research including leveraging ML/AI 
techniques to optimize performance and accuracy of this approach in 
operational settings."

     "description": "The InternetRoute Registry(IRR)and Resource Public 
Key Infrastructure (RPKI) both emerged as different solutions to improve
 routing security in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) by allowing 
networks to register information and develop route filters based on 
information other networks have registered. RPKI is a crypto system, 
with associated complexity and policy challenges; it has seen 
substantial but slowing adoption. IRR databases often contain inaccurate
 records due to lack of validation standards. Given the widespread use 
of IRR for routing security purposes, this inaccuracy merits further 
study. We study IRR accuracy by quantifying the consistency between IRR 
and RPKI records, analyze the causes of inconsistency, and examine which
 ASes are contributing correct IRR information. In October 2021, we 
found matching Route Origin Authorization objects (ROAs) for around 20% 
of RADB IRR records, and a consistency of 38% and 60% in v4 and v6. For 
RIPE IRR, we found ROAs for 47% records and a consistency of 73% and 82%
 in v4 and v6. For APNIC IRR, we found ROAs for 76% records and a high 
consistency of 98% and 99% in v4 and v6. For AFRINIC IRR, we found ROAs 
for only 4% records and a consistency of 93% and 97% in v4 and v6."

     "description": "Web-based speed tests are popular among end-users 
for measuring their network performance. Thousands of measurement 
servers have been deployed in diverse geographical and network locations
 to serve users worldwide. However, most speed tests have opaque 
methodologies, which makes it difficult for researchers to interpret 
their highly aggregated test results, let alone leverage them for 
various studies. In this paper, we propose WebTestKit, a unified and 
configurable framework for facilitating automatic test execution and 
cross-layer analysis of test results for five major web-based speed test
 platforms. Capturing only packet headers of traffic traces, WebTestKit 
performs in-depth analysis by carefully extracting HTTP and timing 
information from test runs. Our testbed experiments showed WebTestKit is
 lightweight and accurate in interpreting encrypted measurement traffic.
 We applied WebTestKit to compare the use of HTTP requests across speed 
tests and investigate the root causes for impeding the accuracy of 
latency measurements, which play a vital role in test server selection 
and throughput estimation. "

     "description": "Almost all popular Internet services are hosted in a
 select set of countries, forcing other nations to rely on international
 connectivity to access them. We identify nations where traffic towards a
 large portion of the country is serviced by a small number of 
Autonomous Systems, and, therefore, may be exposed to observation or 
selective tampering by these ASes. We introduce the Country-level 
Transit Influence (CTI) metric to quantify the significance of a given 
AS on the international transit service of a particular country. By 
studying the CTI values for the top ASes in each country, we find that 
34 nations have transit ecosystems that render them particularly 
exposed, where a single AS is privy to traffic destined to over 40% of 
their IP addresses. In the nations where we are able to validate our 
findings with in-country operators, our top- five ASes are 90% accurate 
on average. In the countries we examine, CTI reveals two classes of 
networks frequently play a particularly prominent role: submarine cable 
operators and state-owned ASes."

     "description": "Geolocating Internet routers is a long-standing and
 notoriously difficult challenge, and current solutions lack the 
accuracy and adaptability to yield reliable results.We revisit this 
problem, designing a solution capable of accurately and comprehensively 
extracting geographic information that network operators embed into 
router interface hostnames. We train our system using dictionaries that 
map geographic codes to known locations, and constrain inferences with 
delay measurements conducted from a distributed set of vantage points. 
While most operators use known geographic codes, some devise their own 
mnemonic codes for locations, which our system also extracts and 
interprets. \r\n\r\nWe evaluate our system on Internet-wide topology 
datasets, automatically learning regular expressions (regexes) for 1023 
different domain suffixes with IPv4 routers, and 241 different domain 
suffixes with IPv6 routers. We received ground truth from operators of 
13 domain suffixes, all of whom confirmed the correctness of our learned
 regexes, and that our system correctly interpreted 78.6% of the custom 
geographic codes. For these 13 suffixes, our solution more accurately 
extracts and interprets geographic information than the previous 
state-of-the-art, correctly geolocating 94.0% of router hostnames with a
 geohint compared to DRoP (56.6%) and HLOC (73.1%). This work advances 
the ability of researchers and network operators to characterize the 
location of critical Internet infrastructure, a foundational building 
block of network performance, security, and resilience analysis. We 
release the source code of our system and our inferred regexes."

online applications for remote learning and telecommuting during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The network performance between cloud regions and 
access networks directly impacts application performance and users’ 
quality of experience (QoE). However, the location and network 
connectivity of vantage points often limits the visibility of edge-based
 measurement platforms (e.g., RIPE Atlas). We designed and implemented 
the CLoud-based Applications Speed Platform (CLASP) to measure 
performance to various networks from virtual machines in cloud regions 
with speed test servers that have been widely deployed on the Internet. 
In our five-month longitudinal measurements in Google Cloud Platform 
(GCP), we found that 30-70% of ISPs we measured showed severe throughput
 degradation from the peak throughput of the day."

     "description": "Autonomous Systems (ASes) exist in two dimensions 
on the Internet: the administrative and the operational one. Regional 
Internet Registries (RIRs) rule the former, while BGP the latter. In 
this work, we reconstruct the lives of the ASes on both dimensions, 
performing a joint analysis that covers 17 years of data. For the 
administrative dimension, we leverage delegation files published by RIRs
 to report the daily status of Internet resources they allocate. For the
 operational dimension, we characterize the temporal activity of ASNs in
 the Internet control plane using BGP data collected by the RouteViews 
and RIPE RIS projects. We present a methodology to extract insights 
about AS life cycles, including dealing with pitfalls affecting 
authoritative public datasets. We then perform a joint analysis to 
establish the relationship (or lack of) between these two dimensions for
 all allocated ASNs and all ASNs visible in BGP. We characterize the 
usual behaviors, specific differences between RIRs and historical 
resources, as well as measure the discrepancies between the two 
\"parallel\" lives. We find discrepancies and misalignment that reveal 
useful insights, and we highlight through examples the potential of this
 new lens to help pinpoint malicious BGP activity and various types of 
misconfigurations. This study illuminates a largely unexplored aspect of
 the Internet global routing system and provides methods and data to 
support broader studies that relate to security, policy, and network 
management."

     "description": "In this paper we present and apply a methodology to
 accurately identify state-owned Internet operators worldwide and their 
Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs). Obtaining an accurate dataset of ASNs 
of state-owned Internet operators enables studies where state ownership 
is an important dimension, including research related to Internet 
censorship and surveillance, cyber-warfare and international relations, 
ICT development and digital divide, critical infrastructure protection, 
and public policy. Our approach is based on a multi-stage, in-depth 
manual analysis of datasets that are highly diverse in nature. We find 
that each of these datasets contributes in different ways to the 
classification process and we identify limitations and shortcomings of 
these data sources. We obtain the first data set of this type, make it 
available to the research community together with the several lessons we
 learned in the process, and perform a preliminary analysis based on our
 data. We find that 53% (i.e., 123) of the world’s countries are 
majority owners of Internet operators, highlighting that this is a 
widespread phenomenon. We also find and document the existence of 
subsidiaries of state-owned governments operating in foreign countries, 
an aspect that touches every continent and particularly affects Africa. 
We hope that this work and the associated data set will inspire and 
enable a broad set of Internet measurement studies and interdisciplinary
 research.dies that relate to security, policy, and network management."

     "description": "IPv6's large address space allows ample freedom for
 choosing and assigning addresses. To improve client privacy and resist 
IP-based tracking, standardized techniques leverage this large address 
space, including privacy extensions and provider prefix rotation. 
Ephemeral and dynamic IPv6 addresses confound not only tracking and 
traffic correlation attempts, but also traditional network measurements,
 logging, and defense mechanisms. We show that the intended 
anti-tracking capability of these widely deployed mechanisms is 
unwittingly subverted by edge routers using legacy IPv6 addressing 
schemes that embed unique identifiers.\r\n\r\nWe develop measurement 
techniques that exploit these legacy devices to make tracking such 
moving IPv6 clients feasible by combining intelligent search space 
reduction with modern high-speed active probing. Via an Internet-wide 
measurement campaign, we discover more than 9M affected edge routers and
 approximately 13k /48 prefixes employing prefix rotation in hundreds of
 ASes worldwide. We mount a six-week campaign to characterize the size 
and dynamics of these deployed IPv6 rotation pools, and demonstrate via a
 case study the ability to remotely track client address movements over 
time. We responsibly disclosed our findings to equipment manufacturers, 
at least one of which subsequently changed their default addressing 
logic."

     "description": "The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the protocol 
that networks use to exchange (announce) routing information across the 
Internet. Unfortunately, BGP has no mechanism to prevent unauthorized 
announcement of network addresses, also known as prefix hijacks. Since 
the 1990s, the primary means of protecting against unauthorized origin 
announcements has been the use of routing information databases, so that
 networks can verify prefix origin information they receive from their 
neighbors in BGP messages. In the 1990s, operators deployed databases 
now collectively known as the Internet Routing Registry (IRR), which 
depend on voluntary (although sometimes contractually required) 
contribution of routing information without strict (or sometimes any) 
validation. Coverage, accuracy, and use of these databases remains 
inconsistent across ISPs and over time.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, after years of 
debate over approaches to improving routing security, the operator 
community deployed an alternative known as the Resource Public Key 
Infrastructure (RPKI). The RPKI includes cryptographic attestation of 
records, including expiration dates, with each Regional Internet 
Registry (RIR) operating as a \"root\" of trust. Similar to the IRR, 
operators can use the RPKI to discard routing messages that do not pass 
origin validation checks. But the additional integrity comes with 
complexity and cost. Furthermore, operational and legal implications of 
potential malfunctions have limited registration in and use of the RPKI.
 In response, some networks have redoubled their efforts to improve the 
accuracy of IRR registration data. These two technologies are now 
operating in parallel, along with the option of doing nothing at all to 
validate routes.\r\n\r\nAlthough RPKI use is growing, its limited 
coverage means that security-conscious operators may query both IRR and 
RPKI databases to maximize routing security. However, IRR information 
may be inaccurate due to improper hygiene, such as not updating the 
origin information after changes in routing policy or prefix ownership. 
Since RPKI uses a stricter registration and validation process, we use 
it as a baseline against which to compare the trends in accuracy and 
coverage of IRR data."

and new ways of applying them, we have undertaken a comprehensive active
 measurement-driven study of the topology of U.S. regional access ISPs. 
We used state-of-the-art approaches in various combinations to 
accommodate the geographic scope, scale, and architectural richness of 
U.S. regional access ISPs. In addition to vantage points from research 
platforms, we used public WiFi hotspots and public transit of mobile 
devices to acquire the visibility needed to thoroughly map access 
networks across regions. We observed many different approaches to 
aggregation and redundancy, across links, nodes, buildings, and at 
different levels of the hierarchy. One result is substantial disparity 
in latency from some Edge COs to their backbone COs, with implications 
for end users of cloud services. Our methods and results can inform 
future analysis of critical infrastructure, including resilience to 
disasters, persistence of the digital divide, and challenges for the 
future of 5G and edge computing."

     "description": "Anycast has proven to be an effective mechanism to 
enhance resilience in the DNS ecosystem and for scaling DNS nameserver 
capacity, both in authoritative and the recursive resolver 
infrastructure. Since its adoption for root servers, anycast has 
mitigated the impact of failures and DDoS attacks on the DNS ecosystem. 
In this work, we quantify the adoption of anycast to support 
authoritative domain name service for top- level and second-level 
domains (TLDs and SLDs). Comparing two comprehensive anycast census 
datasets in 2017 and 2021, with DNS measurements captured over the same 
period, reveals that anycast adoption is increasing, driven by a few 
large operators. While anycast offers compelling resilience advantage, 
it also shifts some resilience risk to other aspects of the 
infrastructure. We discuss these aspects, and how the pervasive use of 
anycast merits a re-evaluation of how to measure DNS resilience."

Exposure of Internet Traffic"
,
     "datePublished": "2021.8",
     "date": "202108",
     "description": "Computer networks play a central role in the 
transmission of information across the world. Autonomous systems 
(administrative domains or “ASes”) are the building blocks of such 
wide-area networks and are responsible for delivering traffic to their 
individual subscribers as well as to other networks to which they are 
connected. So-called transit ASes—who sell access to the rest of the 
Internet to customer ASes for a fee—are mostly invisible to end users 
but may be able to operate on their traffic, for instance by observing 
unencrypted traffic or metadata, or by tampering with specific network 
flows serving popular applications. In many countries, transit ASes 
serve as the principal intermediaries between domestic access ASes and 
the global Internet. xv In this dissertation, we introduce the concept 
of transit influence, which quantifies the exposure of an AS or groups 
thereof, such as in an industrial sector, or nation, to observation and 
tampering by a specific transit network. We hypothesize that there are 
countries where transit agreements are the dominant form of 
international connectivity, and where specific ASes have significant 
degrees of transit influence (TI) over the country as a whole as well as
 over individual organizations within them. We quantify TI by developing
 three metrics at distinct granularities: at the country level (CTI), at
 the AS level (ATI), and at the sectoral level (W-ATI). In order to 
apply these methods, we first identify 75 countries—with approximately 1
 billion Internet users, on aggregate—where transit providers are the 
dominant mode of inbound connectivity, using analyses of existing 
interconnection data and our own large-scale measurement campaign. 
Applying CTI, we find 32 nations that have transit ecosystems with 
concerning topological features: traffic destined to over 40% of their 
IP addresses is exposed to a single network. We further study the AS 
topologies of three nations in South America and find a small number of 
transit ASes that exert out-sized influence in several sectors, 
including finance, utilities, and education. We validate our findings 
with in-country network operators at 123 ASes in 19 countries, who 
confirm that our results are consistent with their understanding of 
their countries’ networks."

     "description": "The Internet has never been more important to our 
society, and understanding the behavior of the Internet is essential. 
The Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) Telescope observes
 a continuous stream of packets from an unsolicited darkspace 
representing 1/256 of the Internet. During 2019 and 2020 over 
40,000,000,000,000 unique packets were collected representing the 
largest ever assembled public corpus of Internet traffic. Using the 
combined resources of the Supercomputing Centers at UC San Diego, 
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and MIT, the spatial temporal 
structure of anonymized source-destination pairs from the CAIDA 
Telescope data has been analyzed with GraphBLAS hierarchical hyper- 
sparse matrices. These analyses provide unique insight on this 
unsolicited Internet darkspace traffic with the discovery of many 
previously unseen scaling relations. The data show a significant 
sustained increase in unsolicited traffic corresponding to the start of 
the COVID19 pandemic, but relatively little change in the underlying 
scaling relations associated with unique sources, source fan-outs,

     "description": "In January and April 2021 we held the Workshop on 
Overcoming Measurement Barriers to Internet Research (WOMBIR) with the 
goal of understanding challenges in network and security data set 
collection and sharing. Most workshop attendees provided white papers 
describing their perspectives, and many participated in short-talks and 
discussion in two virtual workshops over five days. That discussion 
produced consensus around several points. First, many aspects of the 
Internet are characterized by decreasing visibility of important network
 properties, which is in tension with the Internet’s role as critical 
infrastructure. We discussed three specific research areas that 
illustrate this tension: security, Internet access; and mobile 
networking. We discussed visibility challenges at all layers of the 
networking stack, and the challenge of gathering data and validating 
inferences. Important data sets require longitudinal (long-term, 
ongoing) data collection and sharing, support for which is more 
challenging for Internet research than other fields. We discussed why a 
combination of technical and policy methods are necessary to safeguard 
privacy when using or sharing measurement data. Workshop participant 
proposed several opportunities to accelerate progress, some of which 
require coordination across government, industry, and academia."

interdisciplinary Workshop on Internet Economics (WIE) in a virtual Zoom
 conference. This year our goal was to gather feedback from researchers 
on their experiences using CAIDA’s data for economics or policy 
research. We invited all researchers who reported use of CAIDA data in 
these disciplines. We discussed their successes and challenges of using 
the data, and how CAIDA could help these fields via Internet measurement
 and data curation. To avoid Zoom fatigue, we had a conversation-focused
 rather than presentation-focused workshop. Research topics we discussed
 included: Internet data for macroeconomics; connectivity and its effect
 on economic interdependence; effects of the EU’s new GDPR on internet 
interconnection; measuring corporate cyber risk; measuring 
work-from-home trends; measuring the economic value of open source 
software; and more generally how to best support evidence-based 
policymaking."

     "description": "The Internet comprises thousands of independently 
operated networks, interconnected using bilaterally negotiated data 
exchange agreements. The European Union (EU)’s General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) imposes strict restrictions on handling of personal 
data of European Economic Area (EEA) residents. A close examination of 
the text of the law suggests significant cost to application firms. 
Available empirical evidence confirms reduction in data usage in the EEA
 relative to other markets. We investigate whether this decline in 
derived demand for data exchange impacts EEA networks’ decisions to 
interconnect relative to those of non-EEA OECD networks. Our data 
consists of a large sample of interconnection agreements between 
networks globally in 2015–2019. All evidence estimates zero effects: the
 number of observed agreements, the inferred agreement types, and the 
number of observed IP-address-level inter-connection points per 
agreement. We also find economically small effects of the GDPR on the 
entry and the observed number of customers of networks. We conclude 
there is no visible short run effects of the GDPR on these measures at 
the internet layer."

     "description": "Public clouds fundamentally changed the Internet 
landscape, centralizing traffic generation in a handful of networks. 
Internet performance, robustness, and public policy analyses struggle to
 properly reflect this centralization, largely because public 
collections of BGP and traceroute reveal a small portion of cloud 
connectivity.\r\nThis paper evaluates and improves our ability to infer 
cloud connectivity, bootstrapping future measurements and analyses that 
more accurately reflect the cloud-centric Internet. We also provide a 
technique for identifying the interconnections that clouds use to reach 
destinations around the world, allowing edge networks and enterprises to
 understand how clouds reach them via their public WAN. Finally, we 
present two techniques for geolocating the interconnections between 
cloud networks at the city level that can inform assessments of their 
resilience to link failures and help enterprises build multi-cloud 
applications and services."

Internet Routing Security"

     "description": "This paper is concerned with the global routing 
system of the Internet, the serious security vulnerabilities in this 
system, the persistence of these vulnerabilities and the reasons for 
this persistence, the multi-disciplinary considerations that shape this 
space, and some recent trends that may finally improve the security of 
this critical system. In short, the forces that have shaped this space, 
and have contributed to its persistent insecurity, do not center on lack
 of technical proposals, but on economic issues (incentives, 
externalities, and first mover disadvantage), the international 
character of the Internet (which precludes simple domestic regulatory 
interventions and makes consensus building more challenging) and the 
presence of actors in the ecosystem with adverse interests.\r\n\r\nUntil
 recently there had been little real-world evidence of the levels of 
malicious activity enabled by BGP flaws and of how operational practices
 can indeed limit the impact of malicious activity. This data-driven 
perspective provides a strong justification to push for better security 
and for the scheme proposed in this paper.\r\n\r\nThis paper is 
organized as follows: section 2 introduces routing, the flaws in the 
protocol used for routing and why routing security is a difficult and 
persistent problem. Section 3 presents evidence of malicious activity 
from technical measurement work. Section 4 examines a path to partially 
solve the problem and the evidence available of its benefits. In Section
 5 we explain issues not covered by this path, discuss a solution 
formulated by the IETF and its challenges, and finish by proposing a new
 scheme based on mutual agreements of ISPs to form a routing zone of 
trust. We conclude in section 6."

,
     "datePublished": "2020.12",

     "description": "IP addresses are commonly used to identify hosts or
 properties of hosts. The address assigned to a host may change, 
however, and the extent to which these changes occur in time as well as 
in the address space is currently unknown, especially in IPv6. In this 
work, we take a first step towards understanding the dynamics of IPv6 
address assignments in various networks around the world and how they 
relate to IPv4 dynamics. We present fine grained observations of 
dynamics using data collected from over 3,000 RIPE Atlas probes in 
dual-stack networks. RIPE Atlas probes in these networks report both 
their IPv4 and their IPv6 address, allowing us to track changes over 
time and in the address space. To corroborate and extend our findings, 
we also use a dataset containing 32.7 billion IPv4 and IPv6 address 
associations observed by a major CDN. Our investigation of temporal 
dynamics with these datasets shows that IPv6 assignments have longer 
durations than IPv4 assignments—often remaining stable for 
months—thereby allowing the possibility of long-term fingerprinting of 
IPv6 subscribers. Our analysis of spatial dynamics reveals IPv6 address 
assignment patterns that shed light on the size of the address pools 
network operators use in domestic networks, and provides preliminary 
results on the size of the prefixes delegated to home networks. Our 
observations can benefit many applications, including host reputation 
systems, active probing methods, and mechanisms for privacy 
preservation."

     "description": "In the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
Internet is facing unprecedented surges of traffic induced by the use of
 cloud-based applications, such as online shopping, video conferencing, 
and video streaming. Measuring network performance between cloud 
platforms and access networks can shed light on the quality of 
experience (QoE) that end-users are perceiving in cloud-based 
applications. End users often use network throughput measurement (or 
speed measurement) services to understand their performance of their 
last-mile links. However, these test results are not representative of 
cloud-based application performance, because web speed test servers are 
usually located within access networks. To better understand the 
performance impact of congestion between cloud platforms and access 
ISPs, we developed the CLASP (CLoud-based Applications Speed measurement
 Platform) to conduct throughput measurements from speed test servers to

     "description": "The modern Internet relies on the Domain Name 
System (DNS) to convert between human-readable domain names and IP 
addresses. However, the correct and efficient implementation of this 
function is jeopardized when the configuration data binding domains, 
nameservers and glue records is faulty. In particular lame delegations, 
which occur when a nameserver responsible for a domain is unable to 
provide authoritative information about it, introduce both performance 
and security risks. We perform a broad-based measurement study of lame 
delegations, using both longitudinal zone data and active querying. We 
show that lame delegations of various kinds are common (affecting 
roughly 14% of domains we queried), that they can significantly degrade 
lookup latency (when they do not lead to outright failure), and that 
they expose hundreds of thousands of domains to adversarial takeover. We
 also explore circumstances that give rise to this surprising prevalence
 of lame delegations, including unforeseen interactions between the 
operational procedures of registrars and registries. "

     "description": "We present the design, implementation, evaluation, 
and validation of a system that learns regular expressions (regexes) to 
extract Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) from hostnames associated with 
router interfaces. We train our system with ASNs inferred by 
RouterToAsAssignment and bdrmapIT using topological constraints from 
traceroute paths, as well as ASNs recorded by operators in PeeringDB, to
 learn regexes for 206 different suffixes. Because these methods for 
inferring router ownership can infer the wrong ASN, we modify bdrmapIT 
to integrate this new capability to extract ASNs from hostnames. 
Evaluating against ground truth, our modification correctly 
distinguished stale from correct hostnames for 92.5% of hostnames with 
an ASN different from bdrmapIT’s initial inference. This modification 
allowed bdrmapIT to increase the agreement between extracted and 
inferred ASNs for these routers in the January 2020 ITDK from 87.4% to 
97.1% and reduce the error rate from 1/7.9 to 1/34.5. This work presents
 a new avenue for collecting validation data, opening a broader horizon 
of opportunity for evidence-based router ownership inference."

     "description": "This paper presents and evaluates Trufflehunter, a 
DNS cache snooping tool for estimating the prevalence of rare and 
sensitive Internet applications. Unlike previous efforts that have 
focused on small, misconfigured open DNS resolvers, Trufflehunter models
 the complex behavior of large multi-layer distributed caching 
infrastructures (e.g., such as Google Public DNS). In particular, using 
controlled experiments, we have inferred the caching strategies of the 
four most popular public DNS resolvers (Google Public DNS, Cloudflare 
Quad1, OpenDNS and Quad9). The large footprint of such resolvers 
presents an opportunity to observe rare domain usage, while preserving 
the privacy of the users accessing them. Using a controlled testbed, we 
evaluate how accurately Trufflehunter can estimate domain name usage 
across the U.S. Applying this technique in the wild, we provide a 
lower-bound estimate of the popularity of several rare and sensitive 
applications (most notably smartphone stalkerware) which are otherwise 
challenging to survey."

     "description": "Anycast addressing – assigning the same IP address 
to multiple, distributed devices – has become a fundamental approach to 
improving the resilience and performance of Internet services, but its 
conventional deployment model makes it impossible to infer from the 
address itself that it is anycast. Existing methods to detect anycast 
IPv4 prefixes present accuracy challenges stemming from routing and 
latency dynamics, and efficiency and scalability challenges related to 
measurement load. We review these challenges and introduce a new 
technique we call “MAnycast2” that can help overcome them. Our technique
 uses a distributed measurement platform of anycast vantage points as 
sources to probe potential anycast destinations. This approach 
eliminates any sensitivity to latency dynamics, and greatly improves 
efficiency and scalability. We discuss alternatives to overcome 
remaining challenges relating to routing dynamics, suggesting a path 
toward establishing the capability to complete, in under 3 hours, a full
 census of which IPv4 prefixes in the ISI hitlist are anycast."

 longitudinal crowdsourcing study aimed at improving the efficiency of 
crowdsourced QoE assessments. On Amazon Mechanical Turk, we found that 
our design was 20% more cost-effective than crowdsourcing multiple 
one-off short experiments. Our results showed that subjects had a high 
level of revisit intent and continuously participated in our 
experiments. We replicated the video streaming QoE assessments in a 
traditional laboratory setting. Our study showed similar trends in the 
relationship between video bitrate and QoE, which confirm findings in 
prior research."

     "description": "Inbound traffic engineering (ITE)—the process of 
announcing routes to, e.g., maximize revenue or minimize congestion—is 
an essential task for Autonomous Systems (ASes). AS Path Prepending 
(ASPP) is an easy to use and well-known ITE technique that routing 
manuals show as one of the first alternatives to influence other ASes’ 
routing decisions. We observe that origin ASes currently prepend more 
than 25% of all IPv4 prefixes. ASPP consists of inflating the BGP AS 
path. Since the length of the AS path is the second tie-breaker in the 
BGP best path selection, ASPP can steer traffic to other routes. Despite
 being simple and easy to use, the appreciation of ASPP among operators 
and researchers is diverse. Some have questioned its need, 
effectiveness, and predictability, as well as voiced security concerns. 
Motivated by these mixed views, we revisit ASPP. Our longitudinal study 
shows that ASes widely deploy ASPP, and its utilization has slightly 
increased despite public statements against it. We surprisingly spot 
roughly 6k ASes originating at least one prefix with prepends that 
achieve no ITE goal. With active measurements, we show that ASPP 
effectiveness as an ITE tool depends on the AS location and the number 
of available upstreams; that ASPP security implications are practical; 
identify that more than 18% of the prepended prefixes contain 
unnecessary prepends that achieve no apparent goal other than amplifying
 existing routing security risks. We validate our findings in interviews
 with 20 network operators."

     "description": "Ascertaining that a network will forward spoofed 
traffic usually requires an active probing vantage point in that 
network, effectively preventing a comprehensive view of this global 
Internet vulnerability. Recently, researchers have proposed using 
Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) as observatories to detect spoofed 
packets, by leveraging Autonomous System (AS) topology knowledge 
extracted from Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) data to infer which source 
addresses should legitimately appear across parts of the IXP switch 
fabric. We demonstrate that the existing literature does not capture 
several fundamental challenges to this approach, including noise in BGP 
data sources, heuristic AS relationship inference, and idiosyncrasies in
 IXP interconnectivity fabrics. We propose Spoofer-IX, a novel method to
 navigate these challenges, leveraging customer cone semantics of AS 
relationships to guide precise classification of inter-domain traffic as
 in-cone, out-of- cone (spoofed), unverifiable, bogon, and unassigned. 
We apply our method in three distinct periods to two IXPs, with 
200\u002b and 1,600\u002b members each, and find an upper bound volume 
of out-of-cone traffic to be more than an order of magnitude less than 
the previous method inferred on the same data, revealing the practical 
importance of customer cone semantics in such analysis. We observed no 
significant improvement in deployment of Source Address Validation (SAV)
 in networks using the mid-size IXP between 2017 and 2019. In hopes that
 our methods and tools generalize to use by other IXPs who want to avoid
 use of their infrastructure for launching spoofed-source DoS attacks, 
we explore the feasibility of scaling the system to larger and more 
diverse IXP infrastructures. To promote this goal, and broad 
replicability of our results, we make the source code of Spoofer-IX 
publicly available."

make our society safer, smarter, and more sustainable. However, a key 
challenge remains, which is how to protect users and Internet 
infrastructure operators from attacks on or launched through vast 
numbers of autonomously operating sensors and actuators. In this paper, 
we discuss how the security extensions of the Domain Name System (DNS) 
offer an opportunity to help tackle that challenge, while also outlining
 the risks that the IoT poses to the DNS in terms of complex and quickly
 growing IoT-powered Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. We 
identify three challenges for the DNS and IoT industries to seize these 
opportunities and address the risks, for example by making DNS security 
functions (e.g., response verification and encryption) available on 
popular IoT operating systems. "

Unfortunately, little is known about designing and organizing virtual

challenges and rationale for various organizational decisions we made in
 designing the virtual format of PAM 2020. We then illustrate the key 
results from a questionnaire-based survey of participants’ experience 
showing that, while virtual conferences have the potential to broaden

serious challenges in promoting social interactions and broadening the

     "description": "Current methods to analyze the Internet’s 
router-level topology with paths collected using traceroute assume that 
the source address for each router in the path is either an inbound or 
off-path address on each router. In this work, we show that outbound 
addresses are common in our Internet-wide traceroute dataset collected 
by CAIDA's Ark vantage points in January 2020, accounting for 1.7% – 
5.8% of the addresses seen at some point before the end of a traceroute.
 This phenomenon can lead to mistakes in Internet topology analysis, 
such as inferring router ownership and identifying interdomain links. We
 hypothesize that the primary contributor to outbound addresses is Layer
 3 Virtual Private Networks (L3VPNs), and propose vrfinder, a technique 
for identifying L3VPN outbound addresses in traceroute collections. We 
validate vrfinder against ground truth from two large research and 
education networks, demonstrating high precision (100.0%) and recall 
(82.1% – 95.3%). We also show the benefit of accounting for L3VPNs in 
traceroute analysis through extensions to bdrmapIT, increasing the 
accuracy of its router ownership inferences for L3VPN outbound addresses
 from 61.5% - 79.4% to 88.9% - 95.5%."

,
     "datePublished": "2020.6",
     "date": "202006",
     "description": "DNS zone administration is a complex task involving
 manual work and several entities and can therefore result in 
misconfigurations. Orphan records are one of these misconfigurations, in
 which a glue record for a delegation that does not exist anymore is 
forgotten in the zone file. Orphan records are a security hazard to 
third-party domains that have these records in their delegation, as an 
attacker may easily hijack such domains by registering the domain 
associated with the orphan. The goal of this paper is to quantify this 
misconfiguration, extending previous work by Kalafut et al., by 
identifying a new type of glue record misconfiguration – which we refer 
to as abandoned records – and by performing a broader characterization. 
Our results highlight how the situation has changed, not always for the 
better, compared to a decade-old study."

current Operating Procedures for Specific Reviews, I (kc claffy) 
respectfully object to ATRT3’s recommendation on the future of reviews. 
The report recommends terminating all Specific Reviews except their own 
(ATRT): the Security, Stability, and Resiliency Review (SSR), the 
Competition, Consumer Trust, and Consumer Choice Review (CCT) and the 
Registration Directory Service (RDS) Review (formerly WHOIS Review). 
More precisely, the report recommends to suspend any further SSR or RDS 
reviews until and unless a future ATRT deems them necessary again, and 
to allow only one additional CCT review, but not until after the next 
round of new gTLDs. The report recommends replacing these terminated 
reviews with a single new holistic review approximately every 8 years, a
 remarkably long time for the Internet industry. In addition, the report
 recommends terminating all independent organizational reviews and 
replacing them with self-directed, i.e., not independent, “continuous 
improvement programs which have to produce a status report at least 
every three years.” Implementing these changes would require substantial
 changes to ICANN’s Bylaws."

Team (ATRT3) strived diligently with the assistance of the ICANN support
 teams to maintain the process, budget, and schedule identified and 
agreed upon by the team in April of 2019. Circumstances surrounding the 
COVID-19 pandemic led to completing the Final Report approximately 55 
days beyond the Bylaw-mandated one year, but within budget and proposed 
terms of reference. ATRT3 is grateful to the Board for their allowance 
and understanding. Over the course of its work, several unforeseen 
events have occurred that ATRT3 considers subjects for accountability 
and transparency review of the Board, the ICANN organization (org), and 
the community. ATRT3 discussed and made conscious decisions to not 
address some specific items due to where we were in the process at the 
time they were raised or occurred, the events not having drawn to a 
conclusion, unavailability of documents to review, lack of consensus to 
undertake the topic, and our limitations on time, resource, and budget. 
We do however wish to highlight these issues to ensure the ICANN 
community that these are indeed important issues for the accountability 
and transparency of ICANN. "

Evaluation"
,
     "datePublished": "2020.4",
     "date": "202004",
     "description": "Knowledge about the geographic locations of 
Internet routers and servers is highly valuable for research on various 
aspects of Internet structure, performance, economics, and security. 
Whereas databases for geolocation are commercially available and 
targeted mostly at end hosts, RIPE offers an open IPmap platform, 
including its single-radius engine, for geolocation of core Internet 
infrastructure. This paper introduces the research community to the 
IPmap single-radius engine and evaluates effectiveness of this method 
versus commercial geolocation databases NetAcuity and GeoLite2. Access 
to ground truth constitutes a major challenge in conducting such 
evaluation studies. The paper collects IP addresses for its study from 
three sources: virtual machines from the Ring of the Netherlands Network
 Operators’ Group, M-Lab Pods operated by Google, and CAIDA’s Ark 
monitors. The ground truth dataset is further diversified through 
addition of IP addresses that are small latency away from Ark monitors. 
The evaluation considers accuracy, coverage, and consistency of 
geolocation as well as effectiveness of the single-radius method for 
different types of autonomous systems. The paper manually analyzes a 
problematic case where single-radius mistakenly geolocates an IP address
 of a Budapest-based router to Vienna. Finally, the paper provides 
recommendations to both users and developers of the single-radius method
 and discusses limitations of the reported evaluation. The main 
conclusion is that the IPmap single-radius engine geolocates core 
Internet infrastructure more accurately than the considered commercial 
databases and that Internet researchers can greatly benefit from using 
the IPmap platform for their geolocation needs."

     "description": "We use traceroute and BGP data from globally 
distributed Internet measurement infrastructures to study the impact of a
 noteworthy submarine cable launch connecting Africa to South America. 
We leverage archived data from RIPE Atlas and CAIDA Ark platforms, as 
well as custom measurements from strategic vantage points, to quantify 
the differences in end-to-end latency and path lengths before and after 
deployment of this new South-Atlantic cable. We find that ASes operating
 in South America significantly benefit from this new cable, with 
reduced latency to all measured African countries. More surprising is 
that end-to-end latency to/from some regions of the world, including 
intra-African paths towards Angola, increased after switching to the 
cable. We track these unintended consequences to suboptimally circuitous
 IP paths that traveled from Africa to Europe, possibly North America, 
and South America before traveling back to Africa over the cable. 
Although some suboptimalities are expected given the lack of peering 
among neighboring ASes in the developing world, we found two other 
causes: (i) problematic intra-domain routing within a single Angolese 
network, and (ii) suboptimal routing/traffic engineering by its BGP 
neighbors. After notifying the operating AS of our results, we found 
that most of these suboptimalities were subsequently resolved. We 
designed our method to generalize to the study of other cable 
deployments or outages and share our code to promote reproducibility and
 extension of our work"

     "description": "Active measurement tools are important to 
understand and diagnose performance bottlenecks on the Internet. 
However, their overhead is a concern because a high number of additional
 measurement packets can congest the network they try to measure. To 
address this issue, prior work has proposed in-band approaches that 
piggyback application traffic for active measurements. However, prior 
approaches are hard to deploy because they require either specialized 
hardware or modifications in the Linux kernel. In this paper, we propose
 FlowTrace–a readily deployable user-space active measurement framework 
that leverages application TCP flows to carry out in-band network 
measurements. Our implementation of Pathneck using FlowTrace creates 
recursive packet trains to locate bandwidth bottlenecks. The 
experimental evaluation on a testbed shows that FlowTrace is able to 
locate bandwidth bottlenecks as accurately as Pathneck with 
significantly less overhead."

Registering in the RPKI Today"
,
     "datePublished": "2020.3",
     "date": "202003",
     "description": "Securing the Internet’s inter-domain routing system
 against illicit prefix advertisements by third-party networks remains a
 great concern for the research, standardization, and operator 
communities. After many unsuccessful attempts to deploy additional 
security mechanisms for BGP, we now witness increasing adoption of the 
RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure). Backed by strong 
cryptography, the RPKI allows network operators to register their BGP 
prefixes together with the legitimate Autonomous System (AS) number that
 may originate them via BGP. Recent research shows an encouraging trend:
 an increasing number of networks around the globe start to register 
their prefixes in the RPKI. While encouraging, the actual benefit of 
registering prefixes in the RPKI eventually depends on whether transit 
providers in the Internet enforce the RPKI’s content, i.e., configure 
their routers to validate prefix announcements and filter invalid BGP 
announcements. In this work, we present a broad empirical study tackling
 the question: To what degree does registration in the RPKI protect a 
network from illicit announcements of their prefixes, such as prefix 
hijacks? To this end, we first present a longitudinal study of filtering
 behavior of transit providers in the Internet, and second we carry out a
 detailed study of the visibility of legitimate and illegitimate prefix 
announcements in the global routing table, contrasting prefixes 
registered in the RPKI with those not registered. We find that an 
increasing number of transit and access providers indeed do enforce RPKI
 filtering, which translates to a direct benefit for the networks using 
the RPKI in the case of illicit announcements of their address space. 
Our findings bode well for further RPKI adoption and for increasing 
routing security in the Internet."

accurate measurement and analysis. In this paper, we present a new 
technique for resolving router IP aliases that complements existing 
techniques. Our approach, Alias Pruning by Path Length Estimation 
(apple), avoids relying on router manufacturer and operating system 
specific implementations of IP. Instead, it filters potential router 
aliases seen in traceroute by comparing the reply path length from each 
address to a distributed set of vantage points. We evaluated our 
approach on Internet-wide collections of IPv4 and IPv6 traceroutes. We 
compared apple’s router alias inferences against router configurations 
from two R\u0026E networks, finding no false positives. Moreover, 
apple’s coverage of the potential alias pairs in the ground truth 
networks rivals the current state-of-the-art in IPv4, and far exceeds 
existing techniques in IPv6. We also show that apple complements 
existing alias resolution techniques, increasing the total number of 
inferred alias pairs by 109.6% in IPv4, and by 1071.5% in IPv6."

     "description": "On 9-11 December 2019, CAIDA hosted the 10th 
interdisciplinary Workshop on Internet Economics (WIE) at UC San Diego’s
 Supercomputer Center. This workshop series provides a forum for 
researchers, Internet facilities and service providers, technologists, 
economists, theorists, policymakers, and other stakeholders to exchange 
views on current and emerging economic and policy debates. This year’s 
meeting had a narrower focus than in years past, motivated by a new 
NSF-funded project being launched at CAIDA: KISMET (Knowledge of 
Internet Structure: Measurement, Epistemology, and Technology). The 
objective of the KISMET project is to improve the security and 
resilience of key Internet systems by collecting and curating 
infrastructure data in a form that facilitates query, integration and 
analysis. This project is a part of NSF’s new Convergence Accelerator 
program, which seeks to support fundamental scientific exploration by 
creating partnerships across public and private sectors to solve 
problems of national importance."

     "description": "We use historical BGP data and recent active 
measurements to analyze trends in the growth, structure, dynamics and 
performance of the evolving IPv6 Internet, and compare them to the 
evolution of IPv4. We find that the IPv6 network is maturing, albeit 
slowly, and notably IPv6 growth at the AS-level appears to have slowed 
after 2012. While most core Internet transit providers have deployed 
IPv6, edge networks are lagging. Early IPv6 network deployment was 
stronger in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, than in North America. 
Current IPv6 network deployment still shows the same pattern. The IPv6 
topology is characterized by a single dominant player – Hurricane 
Electric – which appears in a large fraction of IPv6 AS paths, and is 
more dominant in IPv6 than the most dominant player in IPv4. Routing 
dynamics in the IPv6 topology are largely similar to those in IPv4, and 
churn in both networks grows at the same rate as the underlying 
topologies. Our measurements suggest that performance over IPv6 paths is
 now largely comparable to (or better than) that over IPv4 paths."

,
     "datePublished": "2019.12",
     "date": "201912",
     "description": "Ascertaining that a network will forward spoofed 
traffic usually requires an active probing vantage point in that 
network, effectively preventing a comprehensive view of this global 
Internet vulnerability. Recently, researchers have proposed using 
Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) as observatories to detect spoofed 
packets, by leveraging Autonomous System (AS) topology knowledge 
extracted from Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) data to infer which source 
addresses should legitimately appear across parts of the IXP switch 
fabric. We demonstrate that the existing literature does not capture 
several fundamental challenges to this approach, including noise in BGP 
data sources, heuristic AS relationship inference, and idiosyncrasies in
 IXP interconnectivity fabrics. We propose a novel method to navigate 
these challenges, leveraging _customer cone_ semantics of AS 
relationships to guide precise classification of inter-domain traffic as
 in-cone, out-of-cone (_spoofed_), unverifiable, bogon, and unassigned. 
We apply our method to a mid-size IXP with approximately 200 members, 
and find an upper bound volume of out-of-cone traffic to be more than an
 order of magnitude less than the previous method inferred on the same 
data. Our work illustrates the subtleties of scientific assessments of 
operational Internet infrastructure, and the need for a community focus 
on reproducing and repeating previous methods."

 Source Address Validation in the Internet"
,
     "datePublished": "2019.11",
     "date": "201911",
     "description": "The Spoofer project has collected data on the 
deployment and characteristics of IP source address validation on the 
Internet since 2005. Data from the project comes from participants who 
install an active probing client that runs in the background. The client
 automatically runs tests both periodically and when it detects a new 
network attachment point. We analyze the rich dataset of Spoofer tests 
in multiple dimensions: across time, networks, autonomous systems, 
countries, and by Internet protocol version. In our data for the year 
ending August 2019, at least a quarter of tested ASes did not filter 
packets with spoofed source addresses leaving their networks. We show 
that routers performing Network Address Translation do not always filter
 spoofed packets, as 6.4% of IPv4/24 tested in the year ending August 
2019 did not filter. Worse, at least two thirds of tested ASes did not 
filter packets entering their networks with source addresses claiming to
 be from within their network that arrived from outside their network. 
We explore several approaches to encouraging remediation and the 
challenges of evaluating their impact. While we have been able to 
remediate 352 IPv4/24, we have found an order of magnitude more IPv4/24 
that remains unremediated, despite myriad remediation strategies, with 
21% unremediated for more than six months. Our analysis provides the 
most complete and confident picture of the Internet’s susceptibility to 
date of this long-standing vulnerability. Although there is no simple 
solution to address the remaining long-tail of unremediated networks, we
 conclude with a discussion of possible non-technical interventions, and
 demonstrate how the platform can support evaluation of the impact of 
such interventions over time."

     "description": "We present the design, implementation, evaluation, 
and validation of a system that automatically learns to extract router 
names (router identifiers) from hostnames stored by network operators in
 different DNS zones, which we represent by regular expressions 
(regexes). Our supervised-learning approach evaluates automatically 
generated candidate regexes against sets of hostnames for IP addresses 
that other alias resolution techniques previously inferred to identify 
interfaces on the same router. Conceptually, if three conditions hold: 
(1) a regex extracts the same value from a set of hostnames associated 
with IP addresses on the same router; (2) the value is unique to that 
router; and (3) the regex extracts names for multiple routers in the 
suffix, then we conclude the regex accurately represents the naming 
convention for the suffix. We train our system using router aliases 
inferred from active probing to learn regexes for 2550 different 
suffixes.\r\n\r\nWe then demonstrate the utility of this system by using
 the regexes to find 105% additional aliases for these suffixes. Regexes
 inferred in IPv4 perfectly predict aliases for ≈85% of suffixes with 
IPv6 aliases, i.e., IPv4 and IPv6 addresses representing the same 
underlying router, and find 9.0 times more routers in IPv6 than found by
 prior techniques."

     "description": "BGP hijacks remain an acute problem in today’s 
Internet, with widespread consequences. While hijack detection systems 
are readily available, they typically rely on a priori prefix-ownership 
information and are reactive in nature. In this work, we take on a new 
perspective on BGP hijacking activity: we introduce and track the 
long-term routing behavior of serial hijackers, networks that repeatedly
 hijack address blocks for malicious purposes, often over the course of 
many months or even years. Based on a ground truth dataset that we 
construct by extracting information from network operator mailing lists,
 we illuminate the dominant routing characteristics of serial hijackers,
 and how they differ from legitimate networks.We then distill features 
that can capture these behavioral differences and train a machine 
learning model to automatically identify Autonomous Systems (ASes) that 
exhibit characteristics similar to serial hijackers. Our classifier 
identifies ≈ 900 ASes with similar behavior in the global IPv4 routing 
table. We analyze and categorize these networks, finding a wide range of
 indicators of malicious activity, misconfiguration, as well as benign 
hijacking activity. Our work presents a solid first step towards 
identifying and understanding this important category of networks, which
 can aid network operators in taking proactive measures to defend 
themselves against prefix hijacking and serve as input for current and 
future detection systems."

Internet, which was formerly dominated by large transit providers, has 
been reshaped after the transition to a multimedia-oriented network, 
first by general-purpose CDNs and now by private CDNs. In this work we 
use k-cores, an element of graph theory, to define which ASes compose 
the core of the Internet and to track the evolution of the core since 
1999. Specifically, we investigate whether large players in the Internet
 content and CDN ecosystem belong to the core and, if so, since when. In
 addition, we examine differences between the IPv4 and IPv6 cores. We 
further investigate regional differences in the evolution of large 
content providers. Finally, we show that the core of the Internet has 
incorporated an increasing number of content ASes in recent years. To 
enable reproducibility of this work, we provide a website to allow 
interactive analysis of our datasets to detect, for example, “up and 
coming” ASes using customized queries."

     "description": "The Internet is transforming our society, 
necessitating a quantitative understanding of Internet traffic. Our team
 collects and curates the largest publicly available Internet traffic 
data containing 50 billion packets. Utilizing a novel hypersparse neural
 network analysis of “video” streams of this traffic using 10,000 
processors in the MIT SuperCloud reveals a new phenomena: the importance
 of otherwise unseen leaf nodes and isolated links in Internet traffic. 
Our neural network approach further shows that a two-parameter modified 
Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution accurately describes a wide variety of 
source/destination statistics on moving sample windows ranging from 
100,000 to 100,000,000 packets over collections that span years and 
continents. The inferred model parameters distinguish different network 
streams and the model leaf parameter strongly correlates with the 
fraction of the traffic in different underlying network topologies. The 
hypersparse neural network pipeline is highly adaptable and different 
network statistics and training models can be incorporated with simple 
changes to the image filter functions."

     "description": "In previous papers, Lehr and Sicker (2018a,b) 
argued that the changing character of our telecommunications 
infrastructure called for a new regulatory approach, with a new 
Communications Act to define the duties and authorities of a 
reconceptualized FCC (what we call newFCC in this paper). 
\r\n\r\nToday's Internet ecosystem is comprised of multiple digital 
network platforms organized into a multi-layer architecture. Lower layer
 IP platforms provided by access and backbone ISPs collectively support 
the Internet, on which complementors can build higher-layer platforms, 
such as the platforms provided by powerful firms such as Google, 
Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. These firms control and operate 
multiple platforms within the larger Internet ecosystem. When dominant 
platform providers pursue multi-platform strategies in an effort to 
capture or control a market, such strategies confound current methods 
for defining markets and assessing market power.\r\n\r\nThis paper draws
 on the layered platform nature of the Internet ecosystem, as described 
in Claffy and Clark (2014), to illustrate how this layered character of 
today’s Internet ecosystem calls for new regulatory authority. This 
paper draws on the layered platform model to scope the duties for an 
agency (or agencies) with sector-specific expertise."

,
     "datePublished": "2019.9",
     "date": "201909",
     "description": "One foundational justification for regulatory 
intervention is that there are harms occurring of a character that 
create a public interest in mitigating them. This paper is concerned 
with such harms that arise in the Internet ecosystem. Looking at news 
headlines for the last few years, it may seem that the range of such 
harms is unbounded. Hoping to add some order to the chaos, we undertake 
an effort to classify harms in the Internet ecosystem, in pursuit of a 
more or less complete taxonomy of harms. Our goal in structuring this 
taxonomy is to facilitate conversations and ideas to help mitigate harms
 in a more systematic way, as opposed to fighting an endless defensive 
battle against whatever happens next.\r\n\r\nThe background we bring to 
this paper is on the one hand architectural--how the Internet ecosystem 
is actually structured---and on the other hand empirical--how we should 
measure the Internet to best understand what is happening. If everything
 were wonderful about the Internet today, the need to measure and 
understand would not be so compelling. A justification for measurement 
follows from its ability to shed light on problems and challenges. 
Sustained measurement or compelled reporting of data, and the analysis 
of the collected data, generally comes at considerable effort and cost, 
so must be justified by an argument that it will shed light on something
 important. This reasoning naturally motivates our taxonomy of things 
that are wrong--what we call harms. That is where we, the research 
community generally, and governments should focus attention. We do not 
intend this paper as a catalog of pessimism, but to help define an 
action agenda for the research community and for governments. The 
structure of the paper proceeds \"up the layers\", from technology to 
society. For harms that are closer to the technology, we can be more 
specific about the harms, and more specific about possible measurements 
and remedies, and actors that could undertake them.\r\n\r\nOne 
motivation for this paper is that we believe the Internet ecosystem is 
at an inflection point. The Internet has revolutionized our ability to 
store, move, and process information, including information about 
people, and we are only at the beginning of understanding its impact on 
society and how to manage and mitigate harms resulting from unregulated 
commercial use of these capabilities. Current events suggest that now is
 a point of transition from laissez-faire to regulation. However, the 
path to good regulation is not obvious, and now is the time for the 
research community to think hard about what advice to give the 
governments of the world, and what sort of data can back up that advice.
 Our highest-level goal for this paper is to contribute to a 
conversation along those lines."

 vital infrastructure. Last-mile Internet is no exception. Yet, unlike 
other vital infrastructure, weather’s effect on last-mile Internet

quantify the effect of weather on residential outages. 
\r\n\r\nInvestigating outages in residential networks due to weather is 
challenging because residential Internet is heterogeneous: there are 
different media types, different protocols, and different providers, in 
varying contexts of different local climate and geography. Sensitivity 
to these different factors leads to narrow categories when estimating 
how weather affects these different links. To address these issues we 
perform a large-scale study looking at eight years of active outage 
measurements that were collected across the bulk of the last mile

Researchers have employed crowdsourcing-based approaches to achieve 
scale and diversity of subjects, but not without confounding factors. 
Apart from subjective bias of users, environmental factors introduce 
variance to QoE measurements. We propose QUINCE, a QoE measurement 
platform, which uses a gamified approach to enable longitudinal study 
with repeated and varying measurements in a single platform. We 
leveraged existing Internet measurement data and infrastructures to 
integrate three different types of network and QoE measurements to yield
 a more comprehensive view of subjects. Our preliminarily results show 
that QUINCE achieves a high level of engagement from subjects and 
collects data that is useful for correlating network performance and 
YouTube video streaming QoE."

Workshop on Active Internet Measurements (AIMS-11). This workshop series
 provides a forum for stakeholders in Internet active measurement 
projects to communicate their interests and concerns, and explore 
cooperative approaches to maximizing the collective benefit of deployed 
infrastructure and gathered data. An overarching theme this year was 
scaling the storage, indexing, annotation, and usage of Internet 
measurements. We discussed tradeoffs in use of commercial cloud services
 to to make measurement results more accessible and informative to 
researchers in various disciplines. Other agenda topics included status 
updates on recent measurement infrastructures and community feedback; 
measurement of poorly configured infrastructure; and recent successes 
and approaches to evolving challenges in geolocation, topology, route 
hijacking, and performance measurement. We review highlights of 
discussions of the talks. This report does not cover each topic 
discussed; for more details examine workshop presentations linked from

Unintended Impact of Remote Peering"
,
     "datePublished": "2019.7",
     "date": "201907",
     "description": "Anycast has been widely adopted by today’s Internet
 services, including DNS, CDN, and DDoS protection, in which the same IP
 address is announced from distributed locations and clients are 
directed to the topologically-nearest service replica. Prior research 
has focused on various aspects of anycast, either its usage in 
particular services such as DNS or characterizing its adoption by 
Internetwide active probing methods. In this paper, we first explore an 
alternative approach to characterize anycast based on previously 
collected global BGP routing information. Leveraging state-of-the-art 
active measurement results as near-ground-truth, our passive method 
without requiring any Internet-wide probes can achieve 90% accuracy in 
detecting anycast prefixes. More importantly, our approach uncovers 
anycast prefixes that have been missed by prior datasets based on active
 measurements. While investigating the root causes of inaccuracy, we 
reveal that anycast routing has been entangled with the increased 
adoption of remote peering, a type of layer-2 interconnection where an 
IP network may peer at an IXP remotely without being physically present 
at the IXP. The invisibility of remote peering from layer-3 breaks the 
assumption of the shortest AS paths on BGP and causes an unintended 
impact on anycast performance. We identify such cases from BGP routing 
information and observe that at least 19.2% of anycast prefixes have 
been potentially impacted by remote peering."

 Streaming over Wireless Networks"
,
     "datePublished": "2019.7",
     "date": "201907",
     "description": "Wireless Internet access has brought legions of 
heterogeneous applications all sharing the same resources. However, 
current wireless edge networks that cater to worst or average case 
performance lack the agility to best serve these diverse sessions. 
Simultaneously, software reconfigurable infrastructure has become 
increasingly mainstream to the point that dynamic per packet and per 
flow decisions are possible at multiple layers of the communications 
stack. Exploiting such reconfigurability requires the design of a system
 that can enable a configuration, measure the impact on the application 
performance (Quality of Experience), and adaptively select a new 
configuration. Effectively, this feedback loop is a Markov Decision 
Process whose parameters are unknown. The goal of this work is to 
design, develop and demonstrate QFlow that instantiates this feedback 
loop as an application of reinforcement learning (RL). Our context is 
that of reconfigurable (priority) queueing, and we use the popular 
application of video streaming as our use case. We develop both 
model-free and model-based RL approaches that are tailored to the 
problem of determining which clients should be assigned to which queue 
at each decision period. Through experimental validation, we show how 
the RL-based control policies on QFlow are able to schedule the right 
clients for prioritization in a high-load scenario to outperform the 
status quo, as well as the best known solutions with over 25% 
improvement in QoE, and a perfect QoE score of 5 over 85% of the time."

during Elections in Nondemocratic Regimes"
,

     "description": "In this article, we study the political use of 
denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, a particular form of cyberattack that 
disables web services by flooding them with high levels of data traffic.
 We argue that websites in nondemocratic regimes should be especially 
prone to this type of attack, particularly around political focal points
 such as elections. This is due to two mechanisms: governments employ 
DoS attacks to censor regime-threatening information, while at the same 
time, activists use DoS attacks as a tool to publicly undermine the 
government's authority. We analyze these mechanisms by relying on 
measurements of DoS attacks based on large-scale Internet traffic data. 
Our results show that in authoritarian countries, elections indeed 
increase the number of DoS attacks. However, these attacks do not seem 
to be directed primarily against the country itself but rather against 
other states that serve as hosts for news websites from this country."

     "description": "The Internet is a complex ecosystem composed of 
thousands of Autonomous Systems (ASs) operated by independent 
organizations; each AS having a very limited view outside its own 
network. These complexities and limitations impede network operators to 
finely pinpoint the causes of service degradation or disruption when the
 problem lies outside of their network. In this paper, we present 
Chocolatine, a solution to detect remote connectivity loss using 
Internet Background Radiation (IBR) through a simple and efficient 
method. IBR is unidirectional unsolicited Internet traffic, which is 
easily observed by monitoring unused address space. IBR features two 
remarkable properties: it is originated worldwide, across diverse ASs, 
and it is incessant. We show that the number of IP addresses observed 
from an AS or a geographical area follows a periodic pattern. Then, 
using Seasonal ARIMA to statistically model IBR data, we predict the 
number of IPs for the next time window. Significant deviations from 
these predictions indicate an outage. We evaluated Chocolatine using 
data from the UCSD Network Telescope, operated by CAIDA, with a set of 
documented outages. Our experiments show that the proposed methodology 
achieves a good trade-off between true-positive rate (90%) and false- 
positive rate (2%) and largely outperforms CAIDA’s own IBR based 
detection method. Furthermore, performing a comparison against other 
methods, i.e., with BGP monitoring and active probing, we observe that 
Chocolatine shares a large common set of outages with them in addition 
to many specific outages that would otherwise go undetected."

     "description": "Recent reports show that BGP hijacking has 
increased substantially. BGP hijacking allows malicious ASes to obtain 
IP prefixes for spamming as well as intercepting or blackholing traffic.
 While systems to prevent hijacks are hard to deploy and require the 
cooperation of many other organizations, techniques to detect hijacks 
have been a popular area of study. In this paper, we classify detected 
hijack events in order to document BGP detectors output and understand 
the nature of reported events. We introduce four categories of BGP 
hijack: typos, prepending mistakes, origin changes, and forged AS paths.
 We leverage AS hegemony – a measure of dependency in AS relationship – 
to identify forged AS paths in a fast and efficient way. Besides, we 
utilize heuristic approaches to find common operators’ mistakes such as 
typos and AS prepending mistakes. The proposed approach classifies our 
collected ground truth into four categories with 95.71% accuracy. We 
characterize publicly reported alarms (e.g. BGPMon) with our trained 
classifier and find 4%, 1%, and 2% of typos, prepend mistakes, and BGP 
hijacking with a forged AS path, respectively."

     "description": "Monitoring mobile network performance is critical 
for optimizing the QoE of mobile apps. Until now, few studies have 
considered the actual network performance that mobile apps experience in
 a per-app or per-server granularity. In this paper, we analyze a 
two-year-long dataset collected by a crowdsourcing per-app measurement 
tool to gain new insights into mobile network behavior and application 
performance. We observe that only a small portion of WiFi networks can 
work in high-speed mode, and more than one-third of the observed ISPs 
still have not deployed 4G networks. For cellular networks, the DNS 
settings on smartphones can have a significant impact on mobile app 
network performance. Moreover, we notice that instant messaging (IM) and
 voice over IP (VoIP) services nowadays are not as performant as Web 
services, because the traffic using XMPP experiences longer latencies 
than HTTPS. We propose an automatic performance degradation detection 
and localization method for finding possible network problems in our 
huge, imbalanced and sparse dataset. Our evaluation and case studies 
show that our method is effective and the running time is acceptable."

,
     "datePublished": "2019.6",
     "date": "201906",
     "description": "Geo-locating BGP prefixes can help us understand 
routing anomalies, prefix aggregation, or reveal what regions are 
affected by an Internet outage. Our work shows that the naive approach 
to prefix geo-location—simply mapping each IP address to its 
corresponding geo-location—can be ambiguous because a prefix may contain
 another, separately-announced prefix that maps to a different 
geographical location. Should the containing prefix also map to the 
locations of the contained prefix? We show that this question is 
difficult to answer and characterize the scope of these ambiguities by 
geo-locating around 680,000 prefixes to countries, regions, and cities 
using both GeoLite and NetAcuity Edge. We find that 0.3% of prefixes are
 ambiguous with respect to countries but these prefixes constitute 8.5% 
of the IPv4 address space. In the second part of our work, we study the 
mappings from prefix to location. We find that most prefixes map to only
 a single city but the shorter a prefix, the more locations it maps to. 
Our dataset however contains outliers, e.g., a /23 that maps to as many 
as 127 (potentially spoofed) countries. Our work takes a first look at 
prefix geo-location and identifies issues one should be aware of, which 
paves the way towards more sophisticated applications such as the 
geo-location of autonomous systems. We make our code and datasets 
publicly available to facilitate further analysis."

     "description": "Network programmers can currently deploy an 
arbitrary set of protocols in forwarding devices through data plane 
programming languages such as P4. However, as any other type of 
software, P4 programs are subject to bugs and misconfigurations. Network
 verification tools have been proposed as a means of ensuring that the 
network behaves as expected, but these tools typically require 
programmers to manually model P4 programs, are limited in terms of the 
properties they can guarantee and frequently face severe scalability 
issues. In this paper, we argue for a novel approach to this problem. 
Rather than statically inspecting a network configuration looking for 
bugs, we propose to enforce networking properties at runtime. To this 
end, we developed P4box, a system for deploying runtime monitors in 
programmable data planes. Our results show that P4box allows programmers
 to easily express a broad range of properties. Moreover, we demonstrate
 that runtime monitors represent a small overhead to network devices in 
terms of latency and resource consumption."

needed to measure progress toward/away from this goal/harm? \r\n2. What 
methods do you propose to gather such data? \r\n3. Who are the right 
entities to gather such data, and how should such data be managed and 
shared? \r\n\r\nWith a specific focus on measurement challenges, the 
topics we discussed included: analyzing the evolution of the Internet in
 a layered-platform context to gain new insights; measurement and 
analysis of economic impacts of new technologies using old tools; 
security and trustworthiness, reach (universal service) and 
reachability, sustainability of investment into Internet infrastructure,
 as well as infrastructure to measure the Internet."

     "description": "Even as residential users increasingly rely upon 
the Internet, connectivity sometimes fails. Characterizing small-scale 
failures of last mile networks is essential to improving Internet 
reliability. In this paper, we develop and evaluate an approach to 
detect Internet failure events that affect multiple users simultaneously
 using measurements from the Thunderping project. Thunderping probes 
addresses across the U.S. when the areas in which they are geo-located 
are affected by severe weather alerts. It detects a disruption event 
when an IP address ceases to respond to pings. In this paper, we focus 
on simultaneous disruptions of multiple addresses that are related to 
each other by geography and ISP, and thus are indicative of a shared 
cause. Using binomial testing, we detect groups of per-IP disruptions 
that are unlikely to have happened independently. We characterize these 
dependent disruption events and present results that challenge 
conventional wisdom on how such outages affect Internet address blocks."

     "description": "In this paper, we explore new possibilities, 
created by programmable switches, for fast rerouting upon signals 
triggered by Internet traffic disruptions. We present Blink, a 
data-driven system exploiting TCP-induced signals to detect failures. 
The key intuition behind Blink is that a TCP flow exhibits a predictable
 behavior upon disruption: retransmitting the same packet over and over,
 at epochs exponentially spaced in time. When compounded over multiple 
flows, this behavior creates a strong and characteristic failure signal.
 Blink efficiently analyzes TCP flows, at line rate, to: (i) select 
flows to track; (ii) reliably and quickly detect major traffic 
disruptions; and (iii) recover data-plane connectivity, via next-hops 
compatible with the operator’s policies.\r\n\r\nWe present an end-to-end
 implementation of Blink in P4 together with an extensive evaluation on 
real and synthetic traffic traces. Our results indicate that Blink: (i) 
can achieve sub-second rerouting for realistic Internet traffic; (ii) 
prevents unnecessary traffic shifts, in the presence of noise; and (iii)
 scales to protect large fractions of realistic Internet traffic, on 
existing hardware. We further show the feasibility of Blink by running 
our system on a real Tofino switch."

ProbLink"

     "datePublished": "2019.2",
     "date": "201902",
     "description": "Knowledge of the business relationships between 
Autonomous Systems (ASes) is essential to understanding the behavior of 
the Internet routing system. Despite significant progress in the 
development of relationship inference algorithms, the resulting 
inferences are impractical for many critical real-world applications, 
cannot offer adequate predictability in the configuration of routing 
policies, and suffer from inference oscillations. To achieve more 
practical and stable relationship inference, we first illuminate the 
root causes of the contradiction between these shortcomings and the 
near-perfect validation results for AS-Rank, the state-of-the-art 
relationship inference algorithm. Using a \"naive\" inference approach 
as a benchmark, we find that available validation datasets 
over-represent AS links with easier inference requirements. We identify 
which types of links are harder to infer and develop appropriate 
validation subsets to enable more representative evaluation.\r\n\r\nWe 
then develop a probabilistic algorithm, ProbLink, to overcome the 
challenges in inferring hard links, such as nonvalley-free routing, 
limited visibility, and non-conventional peering practices. ProbLink 
reveals key AS-interconnection features derived from stochastically 
informative signals. Compared to AS-Rank, our approach reduces the error
 rate for all links by 1.6x and, importantly, by up to 6.1x for various 
types of hard links. We demonstrate the practical significance of our 
improvements by evaluating their impact on three applications. Compared 
to the current state-of-theart, ProbLink increases the precision and 
recall of route leak detection by 4.1x and 3.4x respectively, reveals 
27% more complex relationships, and increases the precision of 
predicting the impact of selective advertisements by 34%."

(CS) and in the field of networking in particular is a well-recognized 
problem. For several reasons, including the sensitive and/or proprietary
 nature of some Internet measurements, the networking research community
 pays limited attention to the of reproducibility of results, instead 
tending to accept papers that appear plausible. This article summarises a
 2.5 day long Dagstuhl seminar on Encouraging Reproducibility in 
Scientific Research of the Internet held in October 2018. The seminar 
discussed challenges to improving reproducibility of scientific Internet
 research, and developed a set of recommendations that we as a community
 can undertake to initiate a cultural change toward reproducibility of 
our work. It brought together people both from academia and industry to 
set expectations and formulate concrete recommendations for reproducible
 research. This iteration of the seminar was scoped to computer 
networking research, although the outcomes are likely relevant for a 
broader audience from multiple interdisciplinary fields."

     "description": "BGP prefix hijacking is a critical threat to 
Internet organizations and users. Despite the availability of several 
defense approaches (ranging from RPKI to popular third-party services), 
none of them solves the problem adequately in practice. In fact, they 
suffer from: (i) lack of detection comprehensiveness, allowing 
sophisticated attackers to evade detection, (ii) limited accuracy, 
especially in the case of third-party detection, (iii) delayed 
verification and mitigation of incidents, reaching up to days, and (iv) 
lack of privacy and of flexibility in post-hijack counteractions, on the
 side of network operators. In this work, we propose ARTEMIS (Automatic 
and Real-Time dEtection and MItigation System), a defense approach (a) 
based on accurate and fast detection operated by the AS itself, 
leveraging the pervasiveness of publicly available BGP monitoring 
services and their recent shift towards real-time streaming, thus (b) 
enabling flexible and fast mitigation of hijacking events. Compared to 
previous work, our approach combines characteristics desirable to 
network operators such as comprehensiveness, accuracy, speed, privacy, 
and flexibility. Finally, we show through real-world experiments that, 
with the ARTEMIS approach, prefix hijacking can be neutralized within a 
minute.\r\n"

 their Growth: Spotlight at the Internet Frontier"
,
     "datePublished": "2018.12",
     "date": "201812",
     "description": "This work aims at designing and implementing a 
system able to profile and help manage the set of IXPs in an Internet 
region. As part of the Internet Society's strategy to help monitor and 
understand the evolution of IXPs in a particular region, a 
route-collector data analyzer tool was developed before being deployed 
and tested in AfriNIC. In fact, traffic localization efforts in the 
African peering ecosystem would be more sustained and their efficacy 
assessed if they were supported by a platform, which evaluates and 
reports in real-time about their impact on the Internet. We thus built 
the \"African\" Route-collectors Data Analyzer (ARDA), an open source 
web platform for analyzing publicly available routing information 
collected since 2005 by local route-collectors. ARDA evaluates 
pre-defined metrics that picture the status of the interconnection at 
local, national, and regional levels. It shows that a small proportion 
of AfriNIC ASes (roughly 17%) are peering in the region. Through them, 
58% of all African networks are visible at one IXP or more. These have 
been static from April to September 2017, and even February 2018, 
underlining the need for increased efforts to improve local 
interconnectivity. We show how ARDA can help detect the impact of 
policies on the growth of local IXPs, or continually provide the 
community with up-to-date empirical data on the evolution of the IXP 
substrate. Given its features, this tool will be a helpful compass for 
stakeholders in the quest for better traffic localization and new 
interconnection opportunities in the targeted region."

     "description": "Autonomous Systems (ASes) can reach hundreds of 
networks via Internet eXchange Points (IXPs), allowing improvements in 
traffic delivery performance and competitiveness. Despite the benefits, 
any pair of ASes needs first to agree on exchanging traffic. By 
surveying 100\u002b network operators, we discovered that most 
interconnection agreements are established through ad-hoc and lengthy 
processes heavily influenced by personal relationships and brand image. 
As such, ASes prefer long-term agreements at the expense of a potential 
mismatch between actual delivery performance and current traffic 
dynamics. ASes also miss interconnection opportunities due to trust 
reasons. To improve wide-area traffic delivery performance, we propose 
Dynam-IX, a framework that allows operators to build trust cooperatively
 and implement traffic engineering policies to exploit the rich 
interconnection opportunities at IXPs quickly. Dynam-IX offers a 
protocol to automate the interconnection process, an intent abstraction 
to express interconnection policies, a legal framework to digitally 
handle contracts, and a distributed tamper-proof ledger to create trust 
among ASes. We build and evaluate a Dynam-IX prototype and show that an 
AS can establish tens of agreements per minute with negligible overhead 
for ASes and IXPs."

     "description": "It is well known that Internet infrastructure 
deployment is progressing at a rapid pace in the African continent. A 
flurry of recent research has quantified this, highlighting the 
expansion of its underlying connectivity network. However, improving the
 infrastructure is not useful without appropriately provisioned services
 to exploit it. This paper measures the availability and utilisation of 
web infrastructure in Africa. Whereas others have explored web 
infrastructure in developed regions, we shed light on practices in 
developing regions. To achieve this, we apply a comprehensive 
measurement methodology to collect data from a variety of sources. We 
first focus on Google to reveal that its content infrastructure in 
Africa is, indeed, expanding. That said, we find that much of its web 
content is still served from the US and Europe, despite being the most 
popular website in many African countries. We repeat the same analysis 
across a number of other regionally popular websites to find that even 
top African websites prefer to host their content abroad. To explore the
 reasons for this, we evaluate some of the major bottlenecks facing 
content delivery networks (CDNs) in Africa. Amongst other factors, we 
find a lack of peering between the networks hosting our probes, 
preventing the sharing of CDN servers, as well as poorly configured DNS 
resolvers. Finally, our mapping of middleboxes in the region reveals 
that there is a greater presence of transparent proxies in Africa than 
in Europe or the US. We conclude the work with a number of suggestions 
for alleviating the issues observed."

     "datePublished": "2018.11",

     "description": "Two complementary approaches to mapping network 
boundaries from traceroute paths recently emerged. Both approaches apply
 heuristics to inform inferences extracted from traceroute measurement 
campaigns. bdrmap used targeted traceroutes from a specific network, 
alias resolution probing techniques, and AS relationship inferences, to 
infer the boundaries of that specific network and the other networks 
attached at each boundary. MAPIT tackled the ambitious challenge of 
inferring all AS-level network boundaries in a massive archived 
collection of traceroutes launched from many different networks. Both 
were substantial contributions to the state-of-the-art, and inspired a 
collaboration to explore the potential to combine the approaches. We 
present and evaluate bdrmapIT , the result of that exploration, which 
yielded a more complete, accurate, and general solution to this 
persistent and central challenge of Internet topology research. bdrmapIT
 achieves 91.8%- 98.8% accuracy when mapping AS boundaries in two 
Internet-wide traceroute datasets, vastly improving on MAP-IT ’s 
coverage without sacrificing bdrmap ’s ability to map a single network. 
The bdrmapIT source code is available at https://git.io/fAsI0"

Workshop on Active Internet Measurements (AIMS-10). This workshop series
 provides a forum for stakeholders in Internet active measurement 
projects to communicate their interests and concerns, and explore 
cooperative approaches to maximizing the collective benefit of deployed 
infrastructure and gathered data. An overarching theme this year was how
 to inform new legislation of communications policy in the U.S. Given 
the continued limited insight into Internet operations by researchers 
and policymakers, we tried to focus these discussions on what data is or
 could be measured to shape and support current and emerging policy 
debates. Materials related to the workshop are at

Although empirical evidence of blackholing activities are documented in

 when attacks occur is still missing.\r\nThis paper presents a first 
joint look at DoS attacks and BGP blackholing in the wild. We do this on
 the basis of two complementary data sets of DoS attacks, inferred from a
 large network telescope and DoS honeypots, and on a data set of 
blackholing events. All data sets span a period of three years, thus 
providing a longitudinal overview of operational deployment of 
blackholing during DoS attacks."

     "description": "There is significant interest in the technical and 
policy communities regarding the extent,scope, and consumer harm of 
persistent interdomain congestion. We provide empirical grounding for 
discussions of interdomain congestion by developing a system and method 
to measure congestion on thousands of interdomain links without direct 
access to them. We implement a system based on the Time Series Latency 
Probes (TSLP) technique that identifies links with evidence of recurring
 congestion suggestive of an under-provisioned link. We deploy our 
system at 86 vantage points worldwide and show that congestion inferred 
using our lightweight TSLP method correlates with other metrics of 
interconnection performance impairment. We use our method to study 
interdomain links of eight large U.S. broadband access providers from 
March 2016 to December 2017, and validate our inferences against 
ground-truth traffic statistics from two of the providers. For the 
period of time over which we gathered measurements, we did not find 
evidence of widespread endemic congestion on interdomain links between 
access ISPs and directly connected transit and content providers, 
although some such links exhibited recurring congestion patterns. We 
describe limitations, open challenges, and a path toward the use of this
 method for large-scale third-party monitoring of the Internet 
interconnection ecosystem."

     "description": "Internet connectivity is changing: Autonomous 
Systems (ASes) can now reach hundreds of networks directly through 
Internet eXchange Points (IXPs), while reducing latency, and improving 
traffic delivery performance and competitiveness. Despite these 
benefits, any pair of ASes needs first to agree on exchanging traffic. 
Establishing interconnections is mostly a manual and lengthy process 
that is heavily influenced by personal relationships and brand image. As
 a result, ASes miss interconnection opportunities and prefer long-term 
agreements, at the expense of a potential mismatch between actual 
delivery performance and current Internet traffic dynamics. We posit 
that IXPs have a large unexplored potential to improve wide-area traffic
 delivery performance as they offer a rich path diversity that could be 
leveraged to enable responsiveness to traffic dynamics (e.g., traffic 
surges, link failures). Facilitating interconnection via IXPs poses two 
major challenges: (i) How to quickly negotiate an agreement? (ii) How to
 decide which networks can be trusted to route traffic? To address these
 challenges, we propose Dynam-IX. Differently from previous academic 
work and industry initiatives, our approach addresses both aspects while
 keeping the privacy of the interconnection policies, which is a concern
 for most network operators."

     "description": "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are a 
major threat to the Internet ecosystem. DDoS cannot only exhaust 
resources of end systems but also of provider uplinks. Ideally, DDoS 
attacks are mitigated close to the attacker, and mitigation only affects
 malicious traffic. Mitigation on inter-domain level is commonly 
implemented with remotely triggered blackholing (RTBH). Blackholing 
enables the victim domain to mark the (usually /32) IP prefix under 
attack using BGP communities. Based on this tagging, adjacent peers can 
filter traffic to the victim to prevent over-load. Although RTBH is an 
easy to implement, cost-efficient and effective mitigation solution, it 
faces a significant draw-back: since all traffic to the victim is 
discarded, the victim becomes completely unreachable. A more fine 
grained filtering is provided in BGP Flowspec [3], which supports 
filtering rules – exchanged through BGP – for 12 different components 
(e.g., source and destination address, TCP flags). In this poster, we 
aim for a better understanding of DDoS traffic from an inter-domain 
perspective. We analyze malicious traffic based on passive measurements 
from a national Internet Service Provider and from a large regional 
Internet Exchange Point. In contrast to previous work (e.g., [2]), we 
try to characterize collateral damage that occurs while blackholing DDoS
 traffic, compared to the benefits of deploying Flowspec. Our ongoing 
analysis shows that (i) current blackholing drops significant portion of
 valid traffic whereas BGP Flowspec requires very little additional 
information to improve the situation, (ii) an IXP is a good vantage 
point to deploy Flowspec close to the attacker."

interdisciplinary Workshop on Internet Economics (WIE) at the UC San 
Diego's Supercomputer Center. This workshop series provides a forum for 
researchers, Internet facilities and service providers, technologists, 
economists, theorists, policy makers, and other stakeholders to exchange
 views on current and emerging regulatory and policy debates. The FCC's 
expected decision (released during the workshop, on 14 December 2017) - 
to repeal the 2015 classification of broadband Internet access service 
as a telecommunications (common carrier) service - set the stage for 
vigorous discussion on what type of data can inform debate, development,
 and empirical evaluation of public policies we will need for Internet 
services in the future."

Outage Detection"
,
     "datePublished": "2018.6",
     "date": "201806",
     "description": "Internet Background Radiation (IBR) is network 
pollution, composed of all kinds of Internet traffic, namely backscatter
 data (due to spoofing), botnet scans and other traffic pollution (due 
to misconfigurations in the networking devices). For many years, IBR 
collected at routed, but unused address spaces, known as Network 
Telescope aka Darknet, has been used in multiple network research 
applications such as identifying malicious Internet activities, 
detecting Internet outages, etc. The Internet Outage Detection Analysis 
(IODA) is a research project of UCSD which uses a predictable signal 
that can be extracted from IBR to monitor the Internet for macroscopic 
Internet connectivity outages. Due to the varied composition of IBR, 
extracting consistent \"normal\" IBR traffic is difficult, but at the 
same time is required to detect outages accurately. In this report, I 
investigate and analyze IBR collected at the UC San Diego Network 
Telescope (UCSD-NT), with the goal of developing a better understanding 
of events distorting the coherent nature of the IBR signal and 
subsequently devising approaches to detect and remove traffic triggered 
by these events. These distortions in the IBR signal can be caused by 
many events, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, 
botnet scans, Domain Name Service (DNS) poisoning, etc. I investigate 
these events to study their causes by various means of statistical and 
experimental tools. In my analysis of three years of IBR data, I detect 
many short-term events which distort a stable signal extracted from IBR 
(used by IODA), by generating traffic bursts. Also, I identify and 
analyze a large-scale event: SYNRENT (coined from SYN-BitTorrent), which
 caused an increase in the TCP-SYN traffic reaching the UCSD-NT for over
 two years. I present a broad characterization of SYNRENT in terms of 
source IPs, countries, Autonomous Systems (AS), operating systems, etc. 
to better understand the phenomenon. This thesis also identifies 
possible causes of SYNRENT such as the Distributed Hash Table (DHT) 
poisoning of BitTorrent traffic in the Great Firewall of China. To 
mitigate such distorting events and bursts, I present a software 
solution to detect and filter them in real-time: the primary idea is to 
use the history of previously observed unique source IPs on destination 
ports and IPs, to determine the occurrence of a burst. In addition to 
proposing and implementing the solution, I provide substantial evidence 
to prove that it successfully detects and removes the components that 
distort the signal from IODA preferred IBR."

Internet, which was formerly dominated by large transit providers, has 
been reshaped after the transition to a multimedia-oriented network, 
first by general-purpose CDNs and now by private CDNs. In this work we 
use k-cores, an element of graph theory, to define which ASes compose 
the core of the Internet and to track the evolution of the core since 
1999. Specifically, we investigate whether large players in the Internet
 content and CDN ecosystem belong to the core and, if so, since when. We
 further investigate regional differences in the evolution of large 
content providers. Finally, we show that the core of the Internet has 
incorporated an increasing number of content ASes in recent years. To 
enable reproducibility of this work, we provide a website to allow 
interactive analysis of our datasets to detect, for example, “up and 
coming” ASes using customized queries."

 The Case of Spoofer"
,
     "datePublished": "2018.6",

     "description": "Internet measurement tools are used to make 
inferences about network policies and practices across the Internet, 
such as censorship, traffic manipulation, bandwidth, and security 
measures. Some tools must be run from vantage points within individual 
networks, so are dependent on volunteer recruitment. A small pool of 
volunteers limits the impact of these tools. Crowdsourcing marketplaces 
can potentially recruit workers to run tools from networks not covered 
by the volunteer pool. \r\n\r\nWe design an infrastructure to collect 
and synchronize measurements from five crowdsourcing platforms, and use 
that infrastructure to collect data on network source address validation
 policies for CAIDA's Spoofer project. In six weeks we increased the 
coverage of Spoofer measurements by recruiting 1519 workers from within 
91 countries and 784 unique ASes for 2,000 Euro; 342 of these ASes were 
not previously covered, and represent a 15% increase in ASes over the 
prior 12 months. We describe lessons learned in recruiting and 
remunerating workers; in particular, strategies to address worker 
behavior when workers are screened because of overlap in the volunteer 
pool."

 Interconnections"

     "description": "The current framework of Internet interconnections,
 based on transit and settlement-free peering relations, has systemic 
problems that often cause peering disputes. Repeated high-profile 
incidents show that this unfortunate state of affairs stands in the way 
of better Internet performance, sometimes even leading to large-scale 
Internet outages. We propose a new techno-economic interconnection 
framework called Nash- Peering, which is based on the principles of Nash
 Bargaining in game theory and economics. Nash-Peering constitutes a 
radical departure from current interconnection practices, providing a 
broader and more economically efficient set of interdomain relations. In
 particular, the direction of payment is not determined by the direction
 of traffic or by rigid customer-provider relationships but based on 
which AS benefits more from the interconnection. We argue that 
Nash-Peering can address the root cause of various types of peering 
disputes."

ultimately, the adoption of IPv6. In this work, we present passive 
measurement-based techniques for detecting CGN deployments across the 
entire Internet, without the requirement of access to machines behind a 
CGN. Specifically, we identify patterns in how client IP addresses are 
observed at MLab servers and at the UCSD network telescope to infer 
whether those clients are behind a CGN. We apply our methods on data 
collected from 2014 to 2016. We find that CGN deployment is increasing 
rapidly. Overall, we infer that 4.1K autonomous systems are deploying 
CGN, 6 times the number inferred by the most recent studies."

     "description": "Internet engineering, science, and public policy 
communities have significant interest in understanding the extent and 
scope of, as well as potential consumer harm induced by, persistent 
interdomain congestion on the Internet. In recent work (Dhamdhere et 
al., 2018), we developed and implemented a lightweight active 
measurement method and system to measure evidence of congestion on 
thousands of interconnection links between broadband access ISPs and 
major interconnecting parties, including directly connected content 
providers. This method provides empirical grounding for discussions of 
interconnection congestion, without requiring direct access to 
interconnection links. \r\n\r\nWe first review the previous work to 
provide context. We then present new techniques for visualizing the data
 in ways we believe are conducive to policy analysis, e.g, of 
infrastructure resilience, performance metrics, and potential harm to 
consumers of persistently under-provisioned interconnection links. We 
present data in ways that allow us to compare different access 
providers, and show how congestion varies over time. We focus on seven 
large U.S. broadband access networks, but there is nothing U.S.-specific
 about the methods we use. Finally, we describe policy-relevant 
limitations and implications of the work."

infer these techniques for assigning YouTube requests to specific Google
 video content caches, including the interconnection links between the 
access providers and Google. We then use a year of measurements (mid2016
 to mid-2017) collected from SamKnows probes hosted by broadband 
customers spanning a major ISP in the U.S. and three ISPs in Europe. We 
investigate two possible causes of different interdomain link usage 
behavior. We also compare the YouTube video cache hostnames and IPs 
observed by the probes, and find that the selection of video cache has

     "description": "BGP prefix hijacking is a threat to Internet 
operators and users. Several mechanisms or modifications to BGP that 
protect the Internet against it have been proposed. However, the reality
 is that most operators have not deployed them and are reluctant to do 
so in the near future. Instead, they rely on basic –and often 
inefficient– proactive defenses to reduce the impact of hijacking 
events, or on detection based on third party services and reactive 
approaches that might take up to several hours. In this work, we present
 the results of a survey we conducted among 75 network operators to 
study: (a) the operators’ awareness of BGP prefix hijacking attacks, (b)
 presently used defenses (if any) against BGP prefix hijacking, (c) the 
willingness to adopt new defense mechanisms, and (d) reasons that may 
hinder the deployment of BGP prefix hijacking defenses.We expect the 
findings of this survey to increase the understanding of existing BGP 
hijacking defenses and the needs of network operators, as well as 
contribute towards designing new defense mechanisms that satisfy the 
requirements of the operators."

     "description": "BGP prefix hijacking is a critical threat to 
Internet organizations and users. Despite the availability of several 
defense approaches (ranging from RPKI to popular third-party services), 
none of them solves the problem adequately in practice. They suffer 
from: (i) lack of detection comprehensiveness, allowing sophisticated 
attackers to evade detection, (ii) limited accuracy, especially in the 
case of third-party detection, (iii) delayed verification and mitigation
 of incidents, reaching up to days, and (iv) lack of privacy and of 
flexibility in post-hijack counteractions, from the side of network 
operators. In this work, we propose ARTEMIS, a defense approach (a) 
based on accurate and fast detection operated by the AS itself, 
leveraging the pervasiveness of publicly available BGP monitoring 
services and their recent shift towards real-time streaming, thus (b) 
enabling flexible and fast mitigation of hijacking events. Compared to 
previous work, our approach combines characteristics desirable to 
network operators such as comprehensiveness, accuracy, speed, privacy, 
and flexibility. Finally, we show through real-world experiments that, 
with the ARTEMIS approach, prefix hijacking can be neutralized within a 
minute."

     "description": "We develop and validate Internet path measurement 
techniques to distinguish congestion experienced when a flow 
self-induces congestion in the path from when a flow is affected by an 
already congested path. One application of this technique is for speed 
tests, when the user is affected by congestion either in the last mile 
or in an interconnect link. This difference is important because in the 
latter case, the user is constrained by their service plan (i.e., what 
they are paying for), and in the former case, they are constrained by 
forces outside of their control. We exploit TCP congestion control 
dynamics to distinguish these cases for Internet paths that are 
predominantly TCP traffic. In TCP terms, we re-articulate the question: 
was a TCP flow bottlenecked by an already congested (possibly 
interconnect) link, or did it induce congestion in an otherwise idle 
(possibly a last-mile) link? \r\nTCP congestion control affects the 
round-trip time (RTT) of packets within the flow (i.e., the flow RTT): 
an endpoint sends packets at higher throughput, increasing the occupancy
 of the bottleneck buffer, thereby increasing the RTT of packets in the 
flow. We show that two simple, statistical metrics derived from the flow
 RTT during the slow start period—its coefficient of variation, and the 
normalized difference between the maximum and minimum RTT— can robustly 
identify which type of congestion the flow encounters. We use extensive 
controlled experiments to demonstrate that our technique works with up 
to 90% accuracy. We also evaluate our techniques using two unique 
real-world datasets of TCP throughput measurements using Measurement Lab
 data and the Ark platform. We find up to 99% accuracy in detecting 
self-induced congestion, and up to 85% accuracy in detecting external 
congestion. Our results can benefit regulators of interconnection 
markets, content providers trying to improve customer service, and users
 trying to understand whether poor performance is something they can fix
 by upgrading their service tier."

     "description": "Internet measurement research frequently needs to 
map infrastructure components, such as routers, to their physical 
locations. Although public and commercial geolocation services are often
 used for this purpose, their accuracy when applied to network 
infrastructure has not been previously assessed. Prior work focused on 
evaluating the overall accuracy of geolocation databases, which is 
dominated by their performance on end-user IP addresses. In this work, 
we evaluate the reliability of router geolocation in databases. We use a
 dataset of about 1.64M router interface IP addresses extracted from the
 CAIDA Ark dataset to examine the country- and city-level coverage and 
consistency of popular public and commercial geolocation databases. We 
also create and provide a ground-truth dataset of 16,586 router 
interface addresses and locations, with city-level accuracy, and we use 
it to evaluate the databases’ accuracy with a regional breakdown 
analysis. Our results show that the databases are not reliable for 
geolocating routers and that there is room to improve their country- and
 city-level accuracy. Based on our results, we present a set of 
recommendations to researchers concerning using the geolocation 
databases to geolocate routers."

     "description": "The right vantage point is critical to the success 
of any active measurement. However, most research groups cannot afford 
to design, deploy, and maintain their own network of measurement 
endpoints, and thus rely measurement infrastructure shared by others. 
Unfortunately, the mechanism by which we share access to measurement 
endpoints today is not frictionless; indeed, issues of compatibility, 
trust, and a lack of incentives get in the way of efficiently sharing 
measurement infrastructure. We propose PacketLab, a universal 
measurement endpoint interface that lowers the barriers faced by 
experimenters and measurement endpoint operators. PacketLab is built on 
two key ideas: It moves the measurement logic out of the endpoint to a 
separate experiment control server, making each endpoint a lightweight 
packet source/sink. At the same time, it provides a way to delegate 
access to measurement endpoints while retaining fine-grained control 
over how one’s endpoints are used by others, allowing research groups to
 share measurement infrastructure with each other with little overhead. 
By making the endpoint interface simple, we also make it easier to 
deploy measurement endpoints on any device anywhere, for any period of 
time the owner chooses. We offer PacketLab as a candidate measurement 
interface that can accommodate the research community’s demand for 
future global-scale Internet measurement."

     "description": "Denial-of-Service attacks have rapidly increased in
 terms of frequency and intensity, steadily becoming one of the biggest 
threats to Internet stability and reliability. However, a rigorous 
comprehensive characterization of this phenomenon, and of 
countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks, faces many 
infrastructure and analytic challenges. We make progress toward this 
goal, by introducing and applying a new framework to enable a 
macroscopic characterization of attacks, attack targets, and DDoS 
Protection Services (DPSs). Our analysis leverages data from four 
independent global Internet measurement infrastructures over the last 
two years: backscatter traffic to a large network telescope; logs from 
amplification honeypots; a DNS measurement platform covering 60% of the 
current namespace; and a DNS-based data set focusing on DPS adoption. 
Our results reveal the massive scale of the DoS problem, including an 
eye-opening statistic that one-third of all /24 networks recently 
estimated to be active on the Internet have suffered at least one DoS 
attack over the last two years. We also discovered that often targets 
are simultaneously hit by different types of attacks. In our data, Web 
servers were the most prominent attack target; an average of 3% of the 
Web sites in .com, .net, and .org were involved with attacks, daily. 
Finally, we shed light on factors influencing migration to a DPS."

     "description": "The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) has been used for
 decades as the de facto protocol to exchange reachability information 
among networks in the Internet. However, little is known about how this 
protocol is used to restrict reachability to selected destinations, 
e.g., that are under attack. While such a feature, BGP blackholing, has 
been available for some time, we lack a systematic study of its 
Internet-wide adoption, practices, and network efficacy, as well as the 
profile of blackholed destinations. In this paper, we develop and 
evaluate a methodology to automatically detect BGP blackholing activity 
in the wild. We apply our method to both public and private BGP 
datasets. We find that hundreds of networks, including large transit 
providers, as well as about 50 Internet exchange points (IXPs) offer 
blackholing service to their customers, peers, and members. Between 
2014–2017, the number of blackholed prefixes increased by a factor of 6,
 peaking at 5K concurrently blackholed prefixes by up to 400 Autonomous 
Systems. We assess the effect of blackholing on the data plane using 
both targeted active measurements as well as passive datasets, finding 
that blackholing is indeed highly effective in dropping traffic before 
it reaches its destination, though it also discards legitimate traffic. 
We augment our findings with an analysis of the target IP addresses of 
blackholing. Our tools and insights are relevant for operators 
considering offering or using BGP blackholing services as well as for 
researchers studying DDoS mitigation in the Internet."

     "description": "There is an increasing awareness amongst developing
 regions on the importance of localizing Internet traffic in the quest 
for fast, affordable, and available Internet access. In this paper, we 
focus on Africa, where 37 IXPs are currently interconnecting local ISPs,
 but mostly at the country level. An option to enrich connectivity on 
the continent and incentivize content providers to establish presence in
 the region is to interconnect ISPs present at isolated IXPs by creating
 a distributed IXP layout spanning the continent. The goal of this paper
 is to investigate whether such IXP interconnection would be possible, 
and if successful, to estimate the best-case benefits that could be 
realized in terms of traffic localization and performance. Our hope is 
that quantitatively demonstrating the benefits will provide incentives 
for ISPs to intensify their peering relationships in the region. 
However, it is challenging to estimate this best-case scenario, due to 
numerous economic, political, and geographical factors influencing the 
region. Towards this end, we begin with a thorough analysis of the 
environment in Africa. We then investigate a naive approach to IXP 
interconnection, which shows that a theoretically optimal solution would
 be infeasible in practice due to the prevailing socio-economic 
conditions in the region. We therefore provide an innovative, realistic 
four-step interconnection scheme to achieve the distributed IXP layout 
that considers and parameterizes external socio-economic factors using 
publicly available datasets. We demonstrate that our constrained 
solution doubles the percentage of continental intra-African paths, 
reduces their lengths, and drastically decreases the median of their 
RTTs as well as RTTs to ASes hosting the top 10 global and top 10 
regional Alexa websites. Our approach highlights how, given real-world 
constraints, a solution requires careful considerations in order to be 
practically realizable."

Throughput Measurements"

     "datePublished": "2017.11",

     "description": "We revisit the use of crowdsourced throughput 
measurements to infer and localize congestion on end-to-end paths, with 
particular focus on points of interconnections between ISPs. We analyze 
three challenges with this approach. First, accurately identifying which
 link on the path is congested requires fine-grained network tomography 
techniques not supported by existing throughput measurement platforms. 
Coarse-grained network tomography can perform this link identification 
under certain topological conditions, but we show that these conditions 
do not always hold on the global Internet. Second, existing measurement 
platforms provide limited visibility of paths to popular web content 
sources, and only capture a small fraction of interconnections between 
ISPs. Third, crowdsourcing measurements inherently risks sample bias: 
using measurements from volunteers across the Internet leads to uneven 
distribution of samples across time of day, access link speeds, and home
 network conditions. Finally, it is not clear how large a drop in 
throughput to interpret as evidence of congestion. We investigate these 
challenges in detail, and offer guidelines for deployment of measurement
 infrastructure, strategies, and technologies that can address empirical
 gaps in our understanding of congestion on the Internet."

     "description": "The goal of this work is to investigate the 
prevalence, causes, and impact of congestion on the African IXP 
substrate. Towards this end, we deployed Ark probes (within networks 
peering) at six African IXPs and ran the time-sequence latency probes 
(TSLP) algorithm, thereby collecting latency measurements to both ends 
of each mapped AS link for a whole year. We were able to detect 
congestion events and quantify their periods and magnitudes at four 
IXPs. We then verified the events and investigated the causes by 
interviewing the IXP operators. Our results show that only 2.2% of the 
discovered IP links experienced (sustained or transient) congestion 
during our measurement period. Our findings suggest the need for ISPs to
 carefully monitor the provision of their peering links, so as to avoid 
or quickly mitigate the occurrence of congestion. Regulators may also 
define the maximum level of packet loss in those links to provide some 
protection to communications routed through local IXPs."

the resilience of deployed TCP implementations to blind in-window RST, 
SYN, and data attacks. These three attacks and defenses to the attacks 
were previously described in RFC5961. In this report, we consider the 
resilience of deployed TCP implementations to blind in-window FIN 
attacks, an attack not explicitly covered in RFC5961, where an off-path 
adversary disrupts an established connection by sending a packet that 
the victim believes came from its peer, causing the connection to be 
prematurely closed. We extended scamper, a parallelized packet prober 
with existing TCP behaviour inference capability, to add an active 
measurement test that infers whether or not a TCP implementation will 
accept a FIN packet that contains an acknowledgment value that should 
cause the receiver to discard the packet. We tested operating systems 
(and middleboxes deployed in front) of 4397 webservers in the wild in 
September 2017 and found 18% of tested connections were vulnerable to 
in-window FIN attack packets, consistent with our prior measurements 
testing the resilience of TCP implementations to blind in-window RST, 
SYN, and data attacks."

     "description": "IPv4 Transfer Markets have recently emerged as a 
mechanism for prolonging the usability of IPv4 address space. They 
facilitate the trading of IPv4 address space, which constitutes a 
radical shift transforming IPv4 addresses from a free resource to a 
commodity. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of all 
IPv4 transfers that are published by three regional Internet registries.
 We analyze the overall evolution of transfer markets, whether they lead
 to a healthy redistribution of IP addresses, and the interplay between 
transfers and IPv6 adoption. We find that, to a large extent, IPv4 
transfers serve their intended purpose by moving IP blocks from those 
with excess to those in need - transferred address blocks appear to be 
routed after the transfer, the utilization of transferred blocks is 
greater after the transfer date and a high percentage of the transferred
 space comes from legacy space. We have also proposed a methodology for 
detecting IPv4 transfers in the wild that tracks changes in origins of 
IP prefixes in the global routing table. This method yields promising 
results, yet it produces a large number of false positives due to the 
noisy nature of routing data. We have investigated the cause of these 
false positives and verified that they can be reduced to a volume 
analyzable by a human operator."

     "description": "Peering infrastructures, namely, colocation 
facilities and Internet exchange points, are located in every major 
city, have hundreds of network members, and support hundreds of 
thousands of interconnections around the globe. These infrastructures 
are well provisioned and managed, but outages have to be expected, e.g.,
 due to power failures, human errors, attacks, and natural disasters. 
However, little is known about the frequency and impact of outages at 
these critical infrastructures with high peering concentration. \r\nIn 
this paper, we develop a novel and lightweight methodology for detecting
 peering infrastructure outages. Our methodology relies on the 
observation that BGP communities, announced with routing updates, are an
 excellent and yet unexplored source of information allowing us to 
pinpoint outage locations with high accuracy. We build and operate a 
system that can locate the epi- center of infrastructure outages at the 
level of a building and track the reaction of networks in near 
real-time. Our analysis unveils four times as many outages as compared 
to those publicly reported over the past five years. Moreover, we show 
that such outages have significant impact on remote networks and peering
 infrastructures. Our study provides a unique view of the Internet’s 
behavior under stress that often goes unreported."

,

     "description": "We propose and evaluate a new metric for 
understanding the dependence of the AS-level Internet on individual 
routers. Whereas prior work uses large volumes of reachability probes to
 infer outages, we design an efficient active probing technique that 
directly and unambiguously reveals router restarts. We use our technique
 to survey 149,560 routers across the Internet for 2.5 years. 59,175 of 
the surveyed routers (40%) experience at least one reboot, and we 
quantify the resulting impact of each router outage on global IPv4 and 
IPv6 BGP reachability. \r\n\r\nOur technique complements existing data 
and control plane outage analysis methods by providing a causal link 
from BGP reachability failures to the responsible router(s) and 
multi-homing configurations. While we found the Internet core to be 
largely robust, we identified specific routers that were single points 
of failure for the prefixes they advertised. In total, 2,385 routers – 
4.0% of the routers that restarted over the course of 2.5 years of 
probing – were single points of failure for 3,396 IPv6 prefixes 
announced by 1,708 ASes. We inferred 59% of these routers were the 
customer-edge border router. 2,374 (70%) of the withdrawn prefixes were 
not covered by a less specific prefix, so 1,726 routers (2.9%) of those 
that restarted were single points of failure for at least one network. 
However, a covering route did not imply reachability during a router 
outage, as no previously-responsive address in a withdrawn more specific
 prefix responded during a one-week sample.We validate our reboot and 
single point of failure inference techniques with four networks, finding
 no false positive or false negative reboots, but find some false 
negatives in our single point of failure inferences."

     "description": "Network operators often face the problem of remote 
outages in transit networks leading to significant (sometimes on the 
order of minutes) downtimes. The issue is that BGP, the Internet routing
 protocol, often converges slowly upon such outages, as large bursts of 
messages have to be processed and propagated router by router. 
\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present SWIFT, a fast-reroute framework which 
enables routers to restore connectivity in few seconds upon remote 
outages. SWIFT is based on two novel techniques. First, SWIFT deals with
 slow outage notification by predicting the overall extent of a remote 
failure out of few control-plane (BGP) messages. The key insight is that
 significant inference speed can be gained at the price of some 
accuracy. Second, SWIFT introduces a new dataplane encoding scheme, 
which enables quick and flexible update of the affected forwarding 
entries. SWIFT is deployable on existing devices, without modifying 
BGP.\r\n\r\nWe present a complete implementation of SWIFT and 
demonstrate that it is both fast and accurate. In our experiments with 
real BGP traces, SWIFT predicts the extent of a remote outage in few 
seconds with an accuracy of ⇠90% and can restore connectivity for 99% of
 the affected destinations."

researchers, Internet facilities and service providers, technologists, 
economists, theorists, policy makers, and other stakeholders to inform 
current and emerging regulatory and policy debates. This year we first 
returned to the list of aspirations we surveyed at the 2014 workshop, 
and described the challenges of mapping them to actions and measurable 
progress. We then reviewed evolutionary shifts in traffic, topology, 
business, and regulatory models, and (our best understanding of) the 
economics of the ecosystem. These discussions inspired an extended 
thought experiment for the second day of the workshop: outlining a new 
telecommunications legislative framework, including proposing a set of 
goals and scope of such regulation, and minimal list of sections 
required to pursue and measure progress toward those goals. The format 
was a series of focused sessions, where presenters prepared 10-minute 
talks on relevant issues, followed by in-depth discussions. This report 
highlights the discussions and presents relevant open research questions
 identified by participants."

share a single IPv4 address across multiple customers, thus offering an 
immediate solution to the IPv4 address scarcity problem. In this paper, 
we perform a large scale active measurement campaign to detect CGNs in 
fixed broadband networks using NAT Revelio – a tool we have developed 
and validated. Revelio enables us to actively determine from within 
residential networks the type of upstream network address translation, 
namely NAT at the home gateway (customer-grade NAT) or NAT in the ISP 
(Carrier Grade NAT). We demonstrate the generality of the methodology by
 deploying Revelio in the FCC Measuring Broadband America testbed 
operated by SamKnows and also in the RIPE Atlas testbed. We enhance 
Revelio to actively discover from within any home network the type of 
upstream NAT configuration (i.e., simple home NAT or Carrier Grade NAT).
 We ran an active large-scale measurement study of CGN usage from 5,121 
measurement vantage points within over 60 different ISPs operating in 
Europe and the United States. We found that 10% of the ISPs we tested 
have some form of CGN deployment. We validate our results with four ISPs
 at the IP level and, reported to the ground truth we collected, we 
conclude that Revelio was 100% accurate in determining the upstream NAT 
configuration for all the corresponding lines. To the best of our 
knowledge, this represents the largest active measurement study of 
(confirmed) CGN deployments at the IP level in fixed broadband networks 
to date."

     "description": "Despite source IP address spoofing being a known 
vulnerability for at least 25 years, and despite many efforts to shed 
light on the problem, spoofing remains a popular attack method for 
redirection, amplification, and anonymity. To defeat these attacks 
requires operators to ensure their networks filter packets with spoofed 
source IP addresses, known as source address validation (SAV), best 
deployed at the edge of the network where traffic originates. In this 
paper, we present a new method using routing loops appearing in 
traceroute data to infer inadequate SAV at the transit provider edge, 
where a provider does not filter traffic that should not have come from 
the customer. Our method does not require a vantage point within the 
customer network. We present and validate an algorithm that identifies 
at Internet scale which loops imply a lack of ingress filtering by 
providers. We found 703 provider ASes that do not implement ingress 
filtering on at least one of their links for 1,780 customer ASes. Most 
of these observations are unique compared to the existing methods of the
 Spoofer and Open Resolver projects. By increasing the visibility of the
 networks that allow spoofing, we aim to strengthen the incentives for 
the adoption of SAV."

     "description": "The Internet has become a critical platform for 
economic, political, cultural, and social activity. The technology 
behind the Internet continues to evolve, with ramifications for not only
 the technologies that govern network and application functions, but 
also for social, economic, and legal concerns. Internet protocols impact
 not only the basic performance and reliability of Internet services, 
but also impact debates about fairness issues in content delivery, free 
speech, trust and cybersecurity, privacy and intellectual property, and 
control over content.\r\n\r\nThis article discusses a proposed future 
Internet architecture that changes how data is delivered over the 
Internet. Named Data Networking (NDN) is a prominent example within the 
broader research field of information-centric networking (ICN). We 
cannot fully predict how changing protocols will change policy outcomes:
 social impacts of technology are caused by an interdependent mix of 
technological decisions, user decisions, and social and policy contexts.
 But if we take seriously the notion that running code shapes rights, 
behavior, and governance, then analyzing how NDN would alter that 
code—the technical infrastructure we rely on every day—is an important 
challenge.\r\n\r\nThis article addresses this challenge by beginning a 
conversation about the social impacts of NDN, with a particular focus on
 content producers and consumers. We describe the building blocks of 
NDN; its request-response data exchange is inspired by the Web, but 
functions at a more fundamental level in the protocol stack. NDN uses 
data names for routing and forwarding, provides per-packet data 
signatures, and leverages in-network storage.a We provide a scenario to 
illustrate the interactions of these building blocks and describe how 
the proposed changes could expand options for free speech, security, 
privacy, and anonymity, while raising new challenges regarding data 
retention and forgetting. We will address impacts for governments and 
content industries caused by changing the way networked data is 
identified, handled, and routed as well as examine how these changes 
raise new challenges and possibilities for ensuring neutrality across 
public networks. Taken together, this anticipatory analysis suggests 
research questions and areas of technical focus for ongoing NDN 
research, and helps us better understand the potential consequences of 
information-centric networking."

     "description": "Applications often use IP addresses as end host 
identifiers based on the assumption that IP addresses do not change 
frequently, even when dynamically assigned. The validity of this 
assumption depends upon the duration of time that an IP address 
continues to be assigned to the same end host, and this duration in 
turn, depends upon the various causes that can induce the currently 
assigned IP address to change. In this work, we identify different 
causes that can lead to an address change and analyze their effect in 
ISPs around the world using data gathered from 3,038 RIPE Atlas probes 
hosted across 929 ASes and 156 countries across all 12 months of 2015. 
Our observations reveal information about ISP practices, outages, and 
dynamic address prefixes. For example, we found 20 ISPs around the world
 that periodically reassign addresses after a fixed period, typically a 
multiple of 24 hours. We also found that address changes are correlated 
with network and power outages occurring at customer premises equipment 
(CPE) devices. Furthermore, almost half of the address changes we 
observed on the same CPE were to an entirely different BGP-routed 
prefix."

     "description": "We tackle the tedious and unsolved problem of 
automatically and correctly inferring network boundaries in traceroute. 
We explain why such a conceptually simple task is so hard in the real 
world, and how lack of progress has impeded a wide range of research and
 development efforts for decades. We develop and validate a method that 
uses targeted traceroutes, knowledge of traceroute idiosyncrasies, and 
codification of topological constraints in a structured set of 
heuristics, to correctly identify interdomain links at the granularity 
of individual border routers. In this study we focus on the network 
boundaries we have most confidence we can accurately infer in the 
presence of sampling bias: interdomain links attached to the network 
launching the traceroute. We develop a scalable implementation of our 
algorithm and validate it against ground truth information provided by 
four networks on 3,277 links, which showed 96.3% - 98.9% of our 
inferences were correct.\r\n\r\nWith 19 vantage points (VPs) distributed
 across a large U.S. broadband provider, we use our method to reveal the
 tremendous density of router-level interconnection between some ASes. 
In January 2016, the broad- band provider had 45 router-level links with
 a Tier-1 peer. We also quantify the VP deployment required to observe 
this ISP's interdomain connectivity, with 17 VPs required to observe all
 45 links. Our method forms the cornerstone of the system we are 
building to map interdomain performance, and we release our code."

     "description": "The limitations of a BGP-inferred AS-level topology
 are generally understood, but the impact of various types of missing 
links on various topology properties and characteristics remains an open
 question. As part of CAIDA's continuing work to improve the 
completeness, accuracy, and richness of the measured AS-level Internet 
graphs, we developed a methodology to combine different types of data 
into a comprehensive (\"combined\") Internet topology. \r\n\r\nOur 
methodology has three steps: deriving a base graph from AS paths 
observed in publicly available BGP by breaking AS paths into AS links; 
augmenting this base graph with traceroute-derived inferred AS links 
(corresponding to only the first AS hop in the traceroute, for 
methodological reasons); and extracting AS level topology data from 
multilateral peering registration information in European Internet 
eXchange Point (IXP) route server data. Specifically, we examined how 
the introduction of 241,459 additional peering links (a 136% increase 
over the BGP graph) and 144 additional nodes (0.3% increase) inferred 
from traceroute and Internet eXchange (IX) data changed the topological 
properties of the ASlevel graph originally derived from the BGP data. 
Notably, only 6.8% of the ASes in the original BGP-based graph gained 
additional links. Of those ASes, links were primarily added to medium 
degree ASes, and ASes classified as edge ASes remained largely 
unaffected. For all four metrics we used to define the peripheral part 
of the graphs (customer cone, coreness, eccentricity, node betweenness),
 the change of the relative size of this part was 3% or less between the
 BGP-based and the combined graphs. One of the primary insights of this 
exercise is that for the largest and smallest degree ASes, BGP 
measurements capture connectivity characteristics well, but for many 
middle-degree ASes, additional connectivity not visible in global BGP 
data repositories is revealed by traceroute-based inferences."

     "description": "We present BGPStream, an open-source software 
framework for the analysis of both historical and real-time Border 
Gateway Protocol (BGP) measurement data. Although BGP is a crucial 
operational component of the Internet infrastructure, and is the subject
 of research in the areas of Internet performance, security, topology, 
protocols, economics, etc., there is no efficient way of processing 
large amounts of distributed and/or live BGP measurement data. BGPStream
 fills this gap, enabling efficient investigation of events, rapid 
prototyping, and building complex tools large-scale monitoring 
applications (e.g., detection of connectivity disruptions or BGP 
hijacking attacks). We discuss the goals and architecture of BGPStream. 
We apply the components of the framework to different scenarios, and we 
describe the development and deployment of complex services for global 
Internet monitoring that we built on top of it."

     "description": "Interconnection links connecting access providers 
to their peers, transit providers and major content providers are a 
potential point of discriminatory treatment and impairment of user 
experience. In the U.S., the FCC has asserted regulatory authority over 
those links, although they have acknowledged they lack sufficient 
expertise to develop appropriate regulations thus far. Without a basis 
of knowledge that relates measurement to justified inferences about 
actual impairment, different actors can put forward opportunistic 
interpretations of data to support their points of view. \r\n\r\nWe 
introduce a topology-aware model of interconnection, to add clarity to a
 recent proliferation of data and claims, and to elucidate our own 
beliefs about how to measure interconnection links of access providers, 
and how policymakers should interpret the results. We use six case 
studies that span data sets offered by access providers, edge providers,
 academic researchers, and one mandated by the FCC. This last example 
reflects our recent experience as the Independent Measurement Experts 
that worked with the FCC and AT\u0026T in establishing a measurement 
methodology for reporting on the state of AT\u0026T’s interconnection 
links. These case studies show how our conceptual model can guide a 
critical analysis of what is or should be measured and reported, and how
 to soundly interpret these measurements. We conclude with insights 
gained in the process of defining the AT\u0026T/DirecTV methodology and 
in the process of defining and applying our conceptual model."

Workshop on Active Internet Measurements (AIMS-8) as part of our series 
of Internet Statistics and Metrics Analysis (ISMA) workshops. This 
workshop series provides a forum for stakeholders in Internet active 
measurement projects to communicate their interests and concerns, and 
explore cooperative approaches to maximizing the collective benefit of 
deployed infrastructure and gathered measurements. Discussion topics 
included: infrastructure development status and plans; experimental 
design, execution, and cross-validation; challenges to incentivize 
hosting, sharing, and using measurement infrastructure; data access, 
sharing, and analytics; and challenges of emerging high bandwidth 
network measurement infrastructure. Other recurrent topics included 
paths toward increased interoperability and cooperative use of 
infrastructures, and ethical frameworks to support active Internet 
measurement. Materials related to the workshop are at

     "description": "This document is a companion to the document titled
 “Report of AT\u0026T Independent Measurement Expert: Reporting 
requirements and measurement methods”, which is the set of requirements 
specified by the Independent Measurement Expert in the matter of the 
Memorandum Opinion and Order for the merger of AT\u0026T and DirecTV. In
 this document, we elaborate on the reasoning and motivation behind the 
measurement methodology we have specified. A paragraph from the merger 
order provides context for our task:\r\n\r\n\u003e Discussion. As stated
 in the 2015 Open Internet Order, “consumers bear the harm when they 
experience degraded access to the applications and services of their 
choosing due to a dispute between a large broadband provider and an 
interconnecting party.” Also, because OVD subscribers expect 
high-quality video, OVDs are vulnerable to degradation at the 
interconnection point with a broadband Internet access service 
provider’s last mile network. Thus, as stated in the 2015 Open Internet 
Order, we find that “broadband Internet access providers have the 
ability to use terms of interconnection to disadvantage edge providers 
and that consumers’ ability to respond to unjust or unreasonable 
broadband provider practices are limited by switching costs.” We 
appreciate commenters’ concerns in this area."

economists, theorists, policy makers, and other stakeholders to inform 
current and emerging regulatory and policy debates.\r\n\r\nThe FCC’s 
latest open Internet order ostensibly changes the landscape of 
regulation by using Title II as its basis. This year we discussed the 
implications of Title II (common- carrier-based) regulation for issues 
we have looked at in the past, or those shaping current policy 
conversations. Discussion topics included differentiated services on the
 public Internet, evolving approaches to interconnection across 
different segments of the ecosystem (e.g., content to access), QoE and 
QoS measurement techniques and their limitations, interconnection 
measurement and modeling challenges and opportunities, and transparency.
 The format was a series of focused sessions, where presenters prepared 
10-minute talks on relevant issues, followed by in-depth discussions. 
This report highlights the discussions and presents relevant open

The research and operations communities have developed a set of tools 
and data sources for understanding and experimenting with BGP, and on 
February 2016 we organized the first BGP Hackathon, themed around live 
measurement and monitoring of Internet routing. The Hackathon included 
students, researchers, operators, providers, policymakers, and funding 
agencies, working together on projects to measure, visualize, and 
improve routing or the tools we use to study routing. This report 
describes the tools used at the Hackathon and presents an overview of 
the projects. The Hackathon was a success, and we look forward to future
 iterations."

     "description": "We revisit thirty-five years of history related to 
the design of Quality of Service (QoS) on the Internet, hoping to offer 
some clarity to current debates around service differentiation. We 
describe the continual failure to get QoS capabilities deployed on the 
public Internet, including the technical challenges of the 1980s and 
1990s, the business challenges of the 1990s and 2000s, and recent 
regulatory challenges. In short, while the standards community developed
 protocols to support enhanced services (QoS), service providers have 
only deployed them in intranet scenarios where they can internalize 
costs and benefits, rather than across fiscally distinct organizational 
boundaries. We examine lessons learned from this failure to deploy 
interdomain QoS, the resulting tensions and risks, and their regulatory 
implications."

AT\u0026T.\r\n\r\nThe structure of this document is as follows. Section 2
 specifies the disclosure exemption. Section 3 described the reporting 
requirements on interconnecting parties, connectivity and traffic 
management details. Sections 4 and 5 catalog the data that AT\u0026T 
must collect, and methods to collect it. We distinguish the process of 
collection from the reporting that results from the measurements. 
Section 6 specifies the nature of the reporting.\r\n\r\nIn a separate

Utilization"

     "datePublished": "2016.6",
     "date": "201606",
     "description": "One challenge in understanding the evolution of the
 Internet infrastructure is the lack of systematic mechanisms for 
monitoring the extent to which allocated IP addresses are actually used.
 In this paper we advance the science of inferring IPv4 address space 
utilization by proposing a novel taxonomy and analyzing and correlating 
results obtained through different types of measurements. We have 
previously studied an approach based on passive measurements that can 
reveal used portions of the address space unseen by active approaches. 
In this paper, we study such passive approaches in detail, extending our
 methodology to new types of vantage points and identifying traffic 
components that most significantly contribute to discovering used IPv4 
network blocks. We then combine the results we obtained through passive 
measurements together with data from active measurement studies, as well
 as measurements from BGP and additional datasets available to 
researchers. Through the analysis of this large collection of 
heterogeneous datasets, we substantially improve the state of the art in
 terms of: (i) understanding the challenges and opportunities in using 
passive and active techniques to study address utilization; and (ii) 
knowledge of the utilization of the IPv4 space."

     "description": "End-to-end IPv6 performance is a factor that can 
influence IPv6 adoption. The stability of IPv6 – both in the control and
 data plane – is an important determinant of end-to-end performance, as 
it influences packet loss, network latency, and hence application 
performance. In this paper we compare stability and performance 
measurements from the control and data plane in IPv6 and IPv4. To study 
control plane stability, we use BGP feeds from five dual-stacked vantage
 points to measure routing dynamics towards IPv4 and IPv6 destinations. 
To study data plane stability, we probe dual-stacked webservers in 629 
target ASes to determine the availability, RTT performance and RTT 
stability of paths toward these targets. In both control and data plane 
experiments IPv6 exhibited less stability than IPv4. In the control 
plane, most routing dynamics were generated by a small fraction of 
pathological unstable prefixes. In the data-plane, episodes of 
unavailability were longer on IPv6 than on IPv4. We found evidence of 
correlated performance degradation over IPv4 and IPv6 caused by shared 
infrastructure."

 into Internet connectivity and performance by offering a set of 
distributed vantage points that allow both data plane and control plane 
measurements. However, the lack of input and output standardization and 
limitations in querying frequency have hindered the development of 
automated measurement tools that would allow systematic use of LGs. In 
this paper we introduce Periscope, a publicly-accessible overlay that 
unifies LGs into a single platform and automates the discovery and use 
of LG capabilities. The system architecture combines crowd-sourced and 
cloud-hosted querying mechanisms to automate and scale the available 
querying resources. Periscope can handle large bursts of requests, with 
an intelligent controller coordinating multiple concurrent user queries 
without violating the various LG querying rate limitations. As of 
December 2015 Periscope has automatically extracted 1,691 LG nodes in 
297 Autonomous Systems. We show that Periscope significantly extends our
 view of Internet topology obtained through RIPE Atlas and CAIDA's Ark, 
while the combination of traceroute and BGP measurements allows more 
sophisticated measurement studies."

     "description": "In this paper, we propose NAT Revelio, a novel test
 suite and methodology for detecting NAT deployments beyond the home 
gateway, also known as NAT444 (e.g., Carrier Grade NAT). Since NAT444 
solutions may impair performance for some users, understanding the 
extent of NAT444 deployment in the Internet is of interest to 
policymakers, ISPs, and users. We perform an initial validation of the 
NAT Revelio test suite within a controlled NAT444 trial environment 
involving operational residential lines managed by a large operator in 
the UK. We leverage access to a unique SamKnows deployment in the UK and
 collect information about the existence of NAT444 solutions from 2,000 
homes and 26 ISPs. To demonstrate the flexibility of NAT Revelio, we 
also deployed it in project BISmark, an open platform for home broadband
 internet research. We analyze the results and discuss our findings."

     "description": "Network operators measure Internet routes to 
troubleshoot problems, and researchers measure routes to characterize 
the Internet. However, they still rely on decades-old tools like 
traceroute, BGP route collectors, and Looking Glasses, all of which 
permit only a single query about Internet routes—what is the path from 
here to there? This limited interface complicates answering queries 
about routes such as “find routes traversing the Level3/AT\u0026T 
peering in Atlanta,” to understand the scope of a reported problem 
there.\r\n\r\nThis paper presents Sibyl, a system that takes rich 
queries that researchers and operators express as regular expressions, 
then issues and returns traceroutes that match even if it has never 
measured a matching path in the past. Sibyl achieves this goal in three 
steps. First, to maximize its coverage of Internet routing, Sibyl 
integrates together diverse sets of traceroute vantage points that 
provide complementary views, measuring from thousands of networks in 
total. Second, because users may not know which measurements will 
traverse paths of interest, and because vantage point resource 
constraints keep Sibyl from tracing to all destinations from all 
sources, Sibyl uses historical measurements to predict which new ones 
are likely to match a query. Finally, based on these predictions, Sibyl 
optimizes across concurrent queries to decide which measurements to 
issue given resource constraints. We show that Sibyl provides 
researchers and operators with the routing information they need--in 
fact, it matches 76% of the queries that it could match if an oracle 
told it which measurements to issue."

     "description": "This paper presents a network security laboratory 
project for teaching network traffic anomaly detection methods to 
electrical engineering students. The project design follows a 
research-oriented teaching principle, enabling students to make their 
own discoveries in real network traffic, using data captured from a 
large IP darkspace monitor operated at the University of California, San
 Diego (UCSD). Although darkspace traffic does not include bidirectional
 conversations (only attempts to initiate them), it contains traffic 
related to or actually perpetrating a variety of network attacks 
originating from millions of Internet addresses around the world. This 
breadth of coverage makes this darkspace data an excellent choice for a 
hands-on study of Internet attack detection techniques. In addition, 
darkspace data is less privacy-critical than other network traces, 
because it contains only unwanted network traffic and no legitimate 
communication. In the lab exercises presented, students learn about 
network security challenges, search for suspicious anomalies in network 
traffic, and gain experience in presenting and interpreting their own 
findings. They acquire not only security-specific technical skills but 
also general knowledge in statistical data analysis and data mining 
techniques. They are also encouraged to discover new phenomena in the 
data, which helps to ignite their general interest in science and 
engineering research. The Vienna University of Technology, Austria, 
first implemented this laboratory during the summer semester 2014, with a
 class of 41 students. With the help of the Center for Applied Internet 
Data Analysis (CAIDA) at UCSD, all exercises and IP darkspace data are 
publicly available."

IPv6 Network Security Policy"
,
     "datePublished": "2016.2",
     "date": "201602",
     "description": "There is growing operational awareness of the 
challenges in securely operating IPv6 networks. Through a measurement 
study of 520,000 dual-stack servers and 25,000 dual-stack routers, we 
examine the extent to which security policy codified in IPv4 has also 
been deployed in IPv6. We find several high-value target applications 
with a comparatively open security policy in IPv6 including: (i) SSH, 
Telnet, SNMP, are more than twice as open on routers in IPv6 as they are
 in IPv4; (ii) nearly half of routers with BGP open were only open in 
IPv6; and (iii) in the server dataset, SNMP was twice as open in IPv6 as
 in IPv4. We conduct a detailed study of where port blocking policy is 
being applied and find that protocol openness discrepancies are 
consistent within network boundaries, suggesting a systemic failure in 
organizations to deploy consistent security policy. We successfully 
communicate our findings with twelve network operators and all twelve 
confirm that the relative openness was unintentional. Ten of the twelve 
immediately moved to deploy a congruent IPv6 security policy, reflecting
 real operational concern. Finally, we revisit the belief that the 
security impact of this comparative openness in IPv6 is mitigated by the
 infeasibility of IPv6 network-wide scanning—we find that, for both of 
our datasets, host addressing practices make discovering these 
high-value hosts feasible by scanning alone. To help operators 
accurately measure their own IPv6 security posture, we make our probing 
system publicly available."

can also stifle it and lead to user frustration when network performance
 falls below expectations. As mobile networks become the predominant 
method of Internet access, developer, research, network operator, and 
regulatory communities have taken an increased interest in measuring 
end-to-end mobile network performance to, among other goals, minimize 
negative impact on application responsiveness. In this survey, we 
examine current approaches to end-to-end mobile network performance 
measurement, diagnosis, and application prototyping. We compare 
available tools and their shortcomings with respect to the needs of 
developers, researchers, network operators, and regulators. We intend 
for this survey to provide a comprehensive view of currently active 
efforts and some auspicious directions for future work in mobile network
 measurement and mobile application performance evaluation."

     "description": "Annotating Internet interconnections with robust 
physical coordinates at the level of a building facilitates network 
management including interdomain troubleshooting, but also has practical
 value for helping to locate points of attacks, congestion, or 
instability on the Internet. But, like most other aspects of Internet 
interconnection, its geophysical locus is generally not public; the 
facility used for a given link must be inferred to construct a 
macroscopic map of peering. We develop a methodology, called constrained
 facility search, to infer the physical interconnection facility where 
an interconnection occurs among all possible candidates. We rely on 
publicly available data about the presence of networks at different 
facilities, and execute traceroute measurements from more than 8,500 
available measurement servers scattered around the world to identify the
 technical approach used to establish an interconnection. A key insight 
of our method is that inference of the technical approach for an 
interconnection sufficiently constrains the number of candidate 
facilities such that it is often possible to identify the specific 
facility where a given interconnection occurs. Validation via private 
communication with operators confirms the accuracy of our method, which 
outperforms heuristics based on naming schemes and IP geolocation. Our 
study also reveals the multiple roles that routers play at 
interconnection facilities; in many cases the same router implements 
both private interconnections and public peerings, in some cases via 
multiple Internet exchange points. Our study also sheds light on peering
 engineering strategies used by different types of networks around the 
globe."

     "description": "While the performance characteristics of access 
networks and end-user-to-server paths are well-studied, measuring the 
performance of the Internet's _core_ remains, largely, an uncharted 
territory. With more content being moved closer to the end-user, 
server-to-server paths have increased in length and have a significant 
role in dictating the quality of services offered by content and service
 providers. In this paper, we present a large-scale study of the effects
 of _routing_ changes and _congestion_ on the end-to-end latencies of 
server-to-server paths in the core of the Internet. \r\n\r\nWe exploit 
the distributed platform of a large content delivery network, composed 
of thousands of servers around the globe, to assess the performance 
characteristics of the Internet’s core. We conduct measurement campaigns
 between thousands of server pairs, in both forward and reverse 
directions, and analyze the performance characteristics of 
server-to-server paths over both long durations (months) and short 
durations (hours). Our analyses show that there is a large variation in 
the frequency of routing changes. While routing changes typically have 
marginal or no impact on the end-to-end round-trip times (RTTs), 20% of 
them impact IPv4 (IPv6) paths by at least 26 ms (31 ms). We highlight 
how dual-stack servers can be utilized to reduce server-to-server 
latencies by up to 50 ms. Our results indicate that significant daily 
oscillations in end-to-end RTTs of server-to-server paths is not the 
norm, but does occur, and, in most cases, contributes about a 20 ms 
increase in server-to-server path latencies."

     "description": "Data transfer is one of the main functions of the 
Internet. The Internet consists of a large number of interconnected 
subnetworks or domains, known as Autonomous Systems (ASes). Due to 
privacy and other reasons the information about what route to use to 
reach devices within other ASes is not readily available to any given 
AS. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is responsible for discovering and
 distributing this reachability information to all ASes. Since the 
topology of the Internet is highly dynamic, all ASes constantly exchange
 and update this reachability information in small chunks, known as 
routing control packets or BGP updates. In the view of the quick growth 
of the Internet there are significant concerns with the scalability of 
the BGP updates and the efficiency of the BGP routing in general. 
Motivated by these issues we conduct a systematic time series analysis 
of BGP update rates. We find that BGP update time series are extremely 
volatile, exhibit long-term correlations and memory effects, similar to 
seismic time series, or temperature and stock market price fluctuations.
 The presented statistical characterization of BGP update dynamics could
 serve as a basis for validation of existing and developing better 
models of Internet interdomain routing."

     "description": "Quality of Experience (QoE) is a measure of whether
 a use of the Internet meets the needs and (“reasonable”) expectations 
of the user and provider in the context of any specific application. But
 QoE is a subjective measure of quality. While quality of service (QOS) 
is used to describe the technical parameters of any service (peak speed,
 latency, jitter, packet loss), assessment of QoE is 
application-specific. Impairments to QoE derive in part from underlying 
QoS parameters (e.g., jitter impairs voice QoE but not email), and can 
arise anywhere in the network. \r\n\r\nCAIDA and MIT have demonstrated a
 research method that can detect such congestion at points of 
interconnection, and found that business contention (usually well- 
reported in the press) correlates with evidence of substantial 
persistent congestion at points of interconnection – some episodes have 
persisted for days or months. Our current research method focuses on 
measuring persistent rather than instantaneous congestion, but with 
instrumentation and refinement of such methods, the research community 
could develop tools that they, the consumer or the FCC could use to 
gather evidence on whether jitter is arising at points of 
interconnection or elsewhere in the network."

     "description": "As part of TCP’s steady evolution, recent standards
 have recommended mechanisms to protect against weaknesses in TCP. But 
adoption, configuration, and deployment of TCP improvements can be slow.
 In this work, we consider the resilience of deployed TCP 
implementations to blind in-window attacks, where an off-path adversary 
disrupts an established connection by sending a packet that the victim 
believes came from its peer, causing data corruption or connection 
reset. We tested operating systems (and middleboxes deployed in front) 
of webservers in the wild in September 2015 and found 22% of connections
 vulnerable to in-window SYN and reset packets, 30% vulnerable to 
in-window data packets, and 38.4% vulnerable to at least one of three 
in-window attacks we tested. We also tested out-of-window packets and 
found that while few deployed systems were vulnerable to reset and SYN 
packets, 5.4% of connections accepted in-window data with an invalid 
acknowledgment number. In addition to evaluating commodity TCP stacks, 
we found vulnerabilities in 12 of 14 of the routers and switches we 
characterized – critical network infrastructure where the potential 
impact of any TCP vulnerabilities is particularly acute. This 
surprisingly high level of extant vulnerabilities in the most mature 
Internet transport protocol in use today is a perfect illustration of 
the Internet’s fragility. Embedded in historical context, it also 
provides a strong case for more systematic, scientific, and longitudinal
 measurement and quantitative analysis of fundamental properties of 
critical Internet infrastructure, as well as for the importance of 
better mechanisms to get best security practices deployed."

 Although BGP is a crucial operational component of the Internet 
infrastructure, and is the subject of research in the areas of Internet 
performance, security, topology, protocols, economics, etc., there is no
 standard and efficient way of processing large amounts of distributed 
and/or live BGP measurement data. BGPStream fills this gap, enabling 
efficient investigation of events, rapid prototyping, and building 
complex tools and efficient large-scale monitoring applications (e.g., 
detection of connectivity disruptions or BGP hijacking attacks). We 
discuss the design choices and challenges in the development of 
BGPStream. We apply the components of the framework to different 
scenarios, and we describe the development and deployment of complex 
services for global Internet monitoring that we built on top of it."

     "description": "We have developed a method to localize and quantify
 interdomain congestion in the Internet. Our Time Sequence Latency 
Probes (TSLP) method depends on two facts: Internet traffic patterns are
 typically diurnal, and queues increase packet delay through a router 
during periods of adjacent link congestion. Repeated round trip delay 
measurements from a single test point to the two edges of a congested 
link will show sustained increased latency to the far (but not to the 
near) side of the link. We are designing and implementing a system for 
network-wide measurement of congestion using the TSLP method. We plan to
 support QoE measurements on this system to complement our measurement 
of QoS metrics such as delay and loss rate."

 Network Analysis"

     "description": "For more than a decade, unsolicited traffic sent to
 unused regions of the address space has provided valuable insight into 
malicious Internet activities. In this paper, we explore the utility of 
this traffic, known as Internet Background Radiation (IBR), for a 
different purpose: as a data source of Internet-wide measurements. We 
collect and analyze IBR from two large darknets, carefully 
deconstructing its various components and characterizing them along 
dimensions applicable to Internet-wide measurements. Intuitively, IBR 
can provide insight into network properties when traffic from that 
network contains relevant information and is of sufficient volume. We 
turn this intuition into a scientific investigation, examining which 
networks send IBR, identifying components of IBR that enable 
opportunistic network inferences, and characterizing the frequency and 
granularity of traffic sources. We also consider the influences of time 
of collection and position in the address space on our results. We 
leverage IBR properties in three case studies to show that IBR can 
supplement existing techniques by improving coverage and/or diversity of
 analyzable networks while reducing measurement overhead. Our main 
contribution is a new framework for understanding the circumstances and 
properties for which unsolicited traffic is an appropriate data source 
for inference of macroscopic Internet properties, which can help other 
researchers assess its utility for a given study."

Utilization"

     "description": "One challenge in understanding the evolution of 
Internet infrastructure is the lack of systematic mechanisms for 
monitoring the extent to which allocated IP addresses are actually used.
 In this paper we try to advance the science of inferring IPv4 address 
space utilization by proposing a novel taxonomy and analyzing and 
correlating results obtained through different types of measurements. We
 have previously studied an approach based on passive measurements that 
can reveal used portions of the address space unseen by active 
approaches. In this paper, we study such passive approaches in detail, 
extending our methodology to new types of vantage points, identifying 
traffic components that most significantly contribute to discovering 
used IPv4 network blocks. We then combine the results we obtained 
through passive measurements together with data from active measurement 
studies, as well as measurements from BGP and additional datasets 
available to researchers. Through the analysis of this large collection 
of heterogeneous datasets, we substantially improve the state of the art
 in terms of: (i) understanding the challenges and opportunities in 
using passive and active techniques to study address utilization; and 
(ii) knowledge of the utilization of the IPv4 space."

     "description": "Ensuring a healthy ecosystem for broadband services
 is critical to securing the future of a healthy and open Internet. From
 the perspective of social welfare maximization, this means collective 
management of the decision-making regarding how we design, operate, 
provide access to, use, and pay for our broadband access networks. 
Realizing this collective goal requires balancing the interests of 
multiple market participants that are often in conflict and evolve in 
light of changing technical, business, and policy conditions.\r\n\r\nThe
 efficiency of markets and regulatory interventions depends on whether 
decision-makers at all market levels are appropriately informed. This 
requires the selective sharing of information. Consumers need 
information about their broadband access options in order to make 
informed decisions about which (if any) broadband services to subscribe 
to, how to use those services, and what investments to make in 
complementary assets (devices, content, applications). Providers of 
content, applications, and other complementary goods and services need 
to know about broadband access options to appropriately position their 
offerings in the market. And, regulators need information about 
broadband access options to design and enforce policies that will 
promote competition and ensure appropriate market choices 
exist.\r\n\r\nAll of these stakeholders need information about broadband
 service availability, pricing, performance, and to the extent 
discernible, about trends and plans that will shape future options. 
Furthermore, broadband access service providers either already possess 
or may more easily obtain a great deal of the information needed by 
market participants. However, the information sharing challenges are far
 from simple. Different stakeholders need different information, 
information is costly to collect and share, and to the extent it impacts
 market outcomes, has strategic value. For example, better informed 
consumers might be more inclined to switch providers, thereby 
intensifying price competition; while better informed regulators may be 
better able to limit supra-competitive profit opportunities. 
Additionally, sharing of too much information about the performance of 
specific broadband connections might threaten subscriber privacy or 
render broadband networks more vulnerable to attack.\r\n\r\nDisclosure 
and Transparency (D\u0026T) policies comprise a toolset of rules, 
processes, and mechanisms that are used by market participants to help 
structure and manage the flow of information that is needed for informed
 decision-making. D\u0026T policies comprise a significant component of 
the regulatory provisions in the FCC's 2015 OIO, which sets forth the 
FCC's approach for regulating providers of broadband access services. 
The focus of this paper is on providing a framework with which to 
interpret the OIO's D\u0026T provisions within the larger market 
context. The OIO's specific D\u0026T provisions are just one component 
of the tools and mechanisms that shape how broadband management relevant
 information is discovered, shared, and interpreted. Other regulatory 
provisions in the OIO and other market mechanisms such as performance 
testing platforms interact with the explicit D\u0026T provisions that 
mandate specific obligations and responsibilities. As we shall explain, 
the richness of D\u0026T tools is desirable in order to address the 
complex and diverse questions that arise in the context of broadband 
management requiring information sharing. Moreover, understanding how 
these D\u0026T policy tools interact and complement (or substitute) for 
each other is helpful if these tools are to be appropriately applied and
 appreciated. Application of these tools should be nuanced and evolvable
 to incentivize cooperation and voluntary disclosure by the ISPs while 
also safeguarding the interests of end users and intermediaries in the 
broadband Internet ecosystem.\r\n\r\nIn Section 2, we review the 
specific D\u0026T provisions in the FCC's 2015 OIO and situate these 
within the larger D\u0026T policy framework. We introduce a meta-tool, 
the D\u0026T Coordinator, to assist in better understanding the 
landscape of potential interventions and with which to contrast the 
relative merits of different interventions in different 
contexts.\r\n\r\nIn Section 3, we apply our framework to divergent 
prototypical examples of the sorts of questions that confront the 
challenge of how to best manage broadband networks. At one end, we have 
what appears to be the narrow and specific question of crafting an 
appropriate set of D\u0026T policies to ensure adequate reporting of 
packet loss by ISPs. At the other extreme, we consider open-ended 
questions that relate to society's aspirations or goals for what the 
Internet and broadband services should be. We argue that an assortment 
of D\u0026T tools are needed for the array of questions confronting 
broadband stakeholders, but with different emphasis, because the 
contexts within which they arise engage both specific and general, 
closed and open-ended details to be addressed 
appropriately.\r\n\r\nSection 4 offers our concluding summary and 
directions for future work."

History"
,
     "datePublished": "2015.9",
     "date": "201509",
     "description": "We revisit the last 35 years of history related to 
the design and specification of Quality of Service (QoS) on the 
Internet, in hopes of offering some clarity to the current debates 
around service differentiation. We describe the continual failure to get
 QoS capabilities deployed on the public Internet, including the 
technical challenges of the 1980s and 1990s, the market-oriented 
(business) challenges of the 1990s and 2000s, and recent regulatory 
challenges. Our historical perspective draws on, among other things, our
 own work from the 1990s that offered proposals for supporting enhanced 
services using the Internet Protocol (IP) suite, and our attempts to 
engage both industry and policymakers in understanding the dynamics of 
the Internet ecosystem. In short, the engineering community successfully
 developed protocols and mechanisms to implement enhanced services 
(QoS), and a few individual service providers have deployed them 
internally or in trusted two-party scenarios. The long-standing failure 
has been to deploy this capability across the public Internet.\r\n\r\nWe
 reflect on lessons learned from the history of this failure, the 
resulting tensions and risks, and their implications for the future of 
Internet infrastructure regulation. First, the continued failure of QoS 
over the last three decades derives from political and economic 
(business) obstacles as well as technical obstacles. The competitive 
nature of the industry, and a long history of anti-trust regulation (at 
least in the U.S.) conflicts with the need for competing providers to 
agree on protocols that require sharing operational data with each other
 to parameterize and verify committed service qualities. Second, QoS 
technology can yield benefits as well as harms, so policymaking should 
focus on harms rather than mechanisms. To assure the benefit to 
consumers, regulators may need to require transparency about the state 
of congestion and provisioning on networks using such mechanisms. Third,
 using QoE as the basis for any regulation will require research, tools 
and capabilities to measure, quantify, and characterize QoE, and 
developing metrics of service quality that better reflect our 
understanding of QoS and QoE for a range of applications. Finally, 
profound shifts in interconnection arrangements suggest a reshaping of 
the debate over QoS on the public Internet. Some access networks are 
interconnecting their private IP-based network platforms to support 
enhanced services, and using this interconnected platform to vertically 
integrate infrastructure and applications. Access networks are also 
connecting directly to large content providers to minimize the risk of 
performance impairments. These changes trigger new regulatory concerns 
over the fate of the public Internet, including capital investment 
incentives and gaps across different bodies of law.\r\n\r\nBarriers to 
the deployment of scalable interprovider QoS may be unsurmountable, but 
since any Internet of the future will face them, it is worth developing a
 systematic understanding to the challenge of enhanced services, and 
documenting successes and failures over the history of the Internet as 
carefully as possible."

     "description": "Securing communication in network applications 
involves many complex tasks that can be daunting even for security 
experts. The Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture builds data 
authentication into the network layer by requiring all applications to 
sign and authenticate every data packet. To make this authentication 
usable, the decision about which keys can sign which data and the 
procedure of signature verification need to be automated. This paper 
explores the ability of NDN to enable such automation through the use of
 trust schemas. Trust schemas can provide data consumers an automatic 
way to discover which keys to use to authenticate individual data 
packets, and provide data producers an automatic decision process about 
which keys to use to sign data packets and, if keys are missing, how to 
create keys while ensuring that they are used only within a narrowly 
defined scope (\"the least privilege principle\"). We have developed a 
set of trust schemas for several prototype NDN applications with 
different trust models of varying complexity. Our experience suggests 
that this approach has the potential of being generally applicable to a 
wide range of NDN applications."

subscriptions for a period of one month. In general, we find high 
variation in delay within the same radio access type and RRC state. 
Across both networks we study, we observe connections with round trip 
delays of several seconds, often multiple times per hour, that are more 
frequent when nodes are moving. Correlating these extreme delay events

     "description": "We introduce and explore a method for inferring 
hidden geometric coordinates of nodes in complex networks based on the 
number of common neighbors between the nodes. We compare this approach 
to the HyperMap method, which is based only on the connections (and 
disconnections) between the nodes, i.e., on the links that the nodes 
have (or do not have). We find that for high degree nodes, the 
common-neighbors approach yields a more accurate inference than the 
link-based method, unless heuristic periodic adjustments (or “correction
 steps”) are used in the latter. The common-neighbors approach is 
computationally intensive, requiring O(t4) running time to map a network
 of t nodes, versus O(t3) in the link-based method. But we also develop a
 hybrid method with O(t3) running time, which combines the 
common-neighbors and link-based approaches, and we explore a heuristic 
that reduces its running time further to O(t2), without significant 
reduction in the mapping accuracy. We apply this method to the 
autonomous systems (ASs) Internet, and we reveal how soft communities of
 ASs evolve over time in the similarity space. We further demonstrate 
the method's predictive power by forecasting future links between ASs. 
Taken altogether, our results advance our understanding of how to 
efficiently and accurately map real networks to their latent geometric 
spaces, which is an important necessary step toward understanding the 
laws that govern the dynamics of nodes in these spaces, and the 
fine-grained dynamics of network connections."

     "description": "The daunting pace of innovation in the information 
and communications technology (ICT) landscape, a landscape of technology
 and business structure, is a well-known but under-appreciated reality. 
In contrast, the rate of  policy and regulatory innovation is much 
slower, partly due to its inherently more deliberative character. We 
describe this disparity in terms of the natural rates of change in 
different parts of the ecosystem, and examine why it has impeded 
attempts to impose effective regulation on the telecommunications 
industry. We explain why a recent movement to reduce this disparity by 
increasing the pace of regulation - adaptive regulation - faces five 
obstacles that may hinder its feasibility in the ICT ecosystem. As a 
means to achieve more sustainable regulatory frameworks for ICT 
industries, we introduce an approach based on finding stable points in 
the system architecture. We explore the origin and role of these stable 
points in a rapidly evolving system, and argue that they can provide a 
means to support development of policies, including adaptive regulation 
approaches, that are more likely to survive the rapid pace of evolution 
in technology.\r\n"

sensitive to these biases. Crowdsourcing is a promising approach to 
address these challenges, although the epistemological implications have
 not yet received substantial attention by the research community. We 
share our findings from leveraging Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) 
system for three distinct network measurement tasks. We describe our 
failure to outsource to MTurk an execution of a security measurement 
tool, our subsequent successful integration of a simple yet meaningful 
measurement within a HIT, and finally the successful use of MTurk to 
quickly provide focused small sample sets that could not be obtained 
easily via alternate means. Finally, we discuss the implications of our 
experiences for other crowdsourced measurement research."

     "description": "On December 10-11 2014, we hosted the 4th 
interdisciplinary Workshop on Internet Economics (WIE) at the UC San 
Diego’s Supercomputer Center. This workshop series provides a forum for 
researchers, Internet facilities and service providers, technologists, 
economists, theorists, policy makers, and other stakeholders to inform 
current and emerging regulatory and policy debates. The objective for 
this year’s workshop was a structured consideration of whether and how 
policy-makers should try to shape the future of the Internet. To 
structure the discussion about policy, we began the workshop with a list
 of potential aspirations for our future telecommunications 
infrastructure (a list we had previously collated), and asked 
participants to articulate an aspiration or fear they had about the 
future of the Internet, which we summarized and discussed on the second 
day. The focus on aspirations was motivated by the high-level 
observation that before discussing regulation, we must agree on the 
objective of the regulation, and why the intended outcome is justified. 
In parallel, we used a similar format as in previous years: a series of 
focused sessions, where 3-4 presenters each prepared 10-minute talks on 
issues in recent regulatory discourse, followed by in-depth discussions.
 This report highlights the discussions and presents relevant open 
research questions identified by participants. Slides presented and a 
copy of this report are available at

     "description": "The RFI asks \"What innovative, transformational 
technologies have the potential to enhance the security, reliability, 
resiliency, and trustworthiness of the digital infrastructure, and to 
protect consumer privacy?\"\r\n\r\nWe believe that it would be 
beneficial to reframe and broaden the scope of this question. The 
security problems that we face today are not new, and do not persist 
because of a lack of a technical breakthrough. Rather, they arise in 
large part in the larger context within which the technology sits, a 
space defined by misaligned economic incentives that exacerbate 
coordination problems, lack of clear leadership, regulatory and legal 
barriers, and the intrinsic complications of a globally connected 
ecosystem with radically distributed ownership of constituent parts of 
the infrastructure. Worse, although the public and private sectors have 
both made enormous investments in cybersecurity technologies over the 
last decade, we lack relevant data that can characterize the nature and 
extent of specific cybersecurity problems, or assess the effectiveness 
of technological or other measures intended to address them.\r\n\r\nWe 
first examine two inherently disconnected views of cybersecurity, the 
correct-operation view and the harm view. These two views do not always 
align. Attacks on specific components, while disrupting correct 
operation, may not map to a specific and quantifiable harm. Classes of 
harms do not always derive from a specific attack on a component; there 
may be many stages of attack activity that result in harm. Technologists
 tend to think about assuring correct operation while users, businesses,

strategies must bridge this gap.\r\n\r\nWe then provide two case studies
 to illustrate our point, and emphasize the importance of developing 
ways to measure the return on federal investment in cybersecurity

nature and society share some common structural properties like 
heterogeneous degree distributions and strong clustering. Recent 
research on network geometry has shown that those real networks can be 
adequately modeled as random geometric graphs in hyperbolic spaces. In 
this paper, we present a computer program to generate such graphs. 
Besides realworld-like networks, the program can generate random graphs 
from other well-known graph ensembles, such as the soft configuration 
model, random geometric graphs on a circle, or Erdős–Rényi random 
graphs. The simulations show a good match between the expected values of
 different network structural properties and the corresponding empirical
 values measured in generated graphs, confirming the accurate behavior 
of the program."

 the Aftermath of an Internet-Wide Scan"
,
     "datePublished": "2015.4",
     "date": "201504",
     "description": "Internet scanning is a de facto background traffic 
noise that is not clear if it poses a dangerous threat, i.e., what 
happens to scanned hosts? what is the success rate of scanning? and 
whether the problem is worth investing significant effort and money on 
mitigating it, e.g., by filtering unwanted traffic? In this work we take
 a first look into Internet scanning from the point of view of scan 
repliers using a unique combination of data sets which allows us to 
estimate how many hosts replied to scanners and whether they were 
subsequently attacked in an actual network. To contain our analysis, we 
focus on a specific interesting scanning event that was orchestrated by 
the Sality botnet during February 2011 which scanned the entire IPv4 
address space. By analyzing unsampled NetFlow records, we show that 2% 
of the scanned hosts actually replied to the scanners. Moreover, by 
correlating scan replies with IDS alerts from the same network, we show 
that significant exploitation activity followed towards the repliers, 
which eventually led to an estimated 8% of compromised repliers. These 
observations suggest that Internet scanning is dangerous: in our 
university network, at least 142 scanned hosts were eventually 
compromised. World-wide, the number of hosts that were compromised in 
response to the studied event is likely much larger."

\"Black\" in the \"Black Art\""
,
     "datePublished": "2015.4",
     "date": "201504",
     "description": "Peering in the Internet interdomain network has 
long been considered a \"black art\", understood in-depth only by a 
select few peering experts while the majority of the network operator 
community only scratches the surface employing conventional 
rules-of-thumb to form peering links through ad hoc personal 
interactions. Why is peering considered a black art? What are the main 
sources of complexity in identifying potential peers, negotiating a 
stable peering relationship, and utility optimization through peering? 
How do contemporary operational practices approach these problems? In 
this work we address these questions for Tier-2 Network Service 
Providers. We identify and explore three major sources of complexity in 
peering: (a) inability to predict traffic flows prior to link formation 
(b) inability to predict economic utility owing to a complex transit and
 peering pricing structure (c) computational infeasibility of 
identifying the optimal set of peers because of the network structure. 
We show that framing optimal peer selection as a formal optimization 
problem and solving it is rendered infeasible by the nature of these 
problems. Our results for traffic complexity show that 15% NSPs lose 
some fraction of customer traffic after peering. Additionally, our 
results for economic complexity show that 15% NSPs lose utility after 
peering, approximately, 50% NSPs end up with higher cumulative costs 
with peering than transit only, and only 10% NSPs get paid-peering 
customers."

     "description": "Botnets are the most common vehicle of 
cyber-criminal activity. They are used for spamming, phishing, denial of
 service\r\nattacks, brute-force cracking, stealing private information,
 and cyber warfare. Botnets carry out network scans for 
several\r\nreasons, including searching for vulnerable machines to 
infect and recruit into the botnet, probing networks for enumeration or 
penetration, etc. We present the measurement and analysis of a 
horizontal scan of the entire IPv4 address space conducted by the Sality
 botnet in February 2011. This 12-day scan originated from approximately
 3 million distinct IP addresses, and used a heavily coordinated and 
unusually covert scanning strategy to try to discover and compromise 
VoIP-related (SIP server) infrastructure. \r\n\r\nWe observed this event
 through the UCSD Network Telescope, a /8 darknet continuously receiving
 large amounts of unsolicited traffic, and we correlate this traffic 
data with other public sources of data to validate our inferences. 
Sality is one of the largest botnets ever identified by researchers, its
 behavior represents ominous advances in the evolution of modern 
malware: the use of more sophisticated stealth scanning strategies by 
millions of coordinated bots, targeting critical\r\nvoice communications
 infrastructure. This work offers a detailed dissection of the botnet‛s 
scanning behavior, including general methods to correlate, visualize, 
and extrapolate botnet behavior across the global Internet."

     "description": "With the 20th anniversary of IPv6 nearing quickly, a
 growing number of Internet service providers (ISPs) now offer their 
customers both IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity. This makes multi-homing with 
IPv4 and IPv6 increasingly common even with just a single ISP 
connection. Furthermore, the growing popularity of multi-path transport,
 especially Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) that is the extension of the 
well-known Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), leads to the question of
 whether this identity duality can be utilized for improving application
 performance in addition to providing resilience. In this paper, we 
first investigate the AS-level congruency of IPv4 and IPv6 paths in the 
Internet. We find that more than 60% of the current IPv4 and IPv6 
AS-paths are non-congruent at the AS-level, which motivates us to 
explore how MPTCP can utilize the IPv4/IPv6 identity duality to improve 
data transfer performance. Our results show that MPTCP, even with a 
single dual-stack Internet connection, can significantly improve the 
end-to-end performance when the underlying paths are noncongruent. The 
extent of the improvement can reach up to the aggregate of the IPv4 and 
IPv6 bandwidths."

     "description": "There is increasing evidence that IPv6 deployment 
is maturing as a response to the exhaustion of unallocated IPv4 address 
blocks, leading to gradual convergence of the IPv4 and IPv6 topologies 
in terms of structure and routing paths. However, the lack of a 
fully-connected\r\ntransit-free clique in IPv6, as well as a different 
economic evolution than IPv4, implies that existing IPv4 AS relationship
 algorithms will not accurately infer relationships between autonomous 
systems in IPv6, encumbering our ability to model and understand IPv6 AS
 topology evolution. We modify CAIDA‛s IPv4 relationship inference 
algorithm to accurately infer IPv6 relationships using publicly 
available BGP data. We validate 24.9% of our 41,589 c2p and p2p 
inferences for July 2014 to have a 99.3% and 94.5% PPV, respectively. 
Using these inferred relationships, we analyze the BGP-observed IPv4 and
 IPv6 AS topologies, and find that ASes are converging toward the same 
relationship types in IPv4 and IPv6, but disparities remain due to 
differences in the transit-free clique and the influence of Hurricane 
Electric in IPv6."

uninterrupted system availability, or *uptime*, from a remote vantage

broader efforts to measure and characterize the availability of critical
 infrastructure, provides insight into network operations, and has 
subtle security implications. Our approach utilizes active probes to 
periodically elicit IPv6 fragment identifiers from IPv6 router 
interfaces, and analyzes the resulting identifier time series for 
reboots. We demonstrate the approach‛s potential by characterizing 
21,539 distinct IPv6 router interfaces over a five-month period. We find
 evidence of clustered reboot events, popular maintenance windows, and 
correlation with globally visible control plane data. Our results, 
validated by five ASes, provide initial insight into the current state

     "description": "Recent years have shown a promising progress in 
understanding geometric underpinnings behind the structure, function, 
and dynamics of many complex networks in nature and society. However, 
these promises cannot be readily fulfilled and lead to important 
practical applications, without a simple, reliable, and fast network 
mapping method to infer the latent geometric coordinates of nodes in a 
real network. Here, we present _HyperMap_, a simple method to map a 
given real network to its hyperbolic space. The method utilizes a recent
 geometric theory of complex networks modeled as random geometric graphs
 in hyperbolic spaces. The method replays the network's geometric 
growth, estimating at each time-step the hyperbolic coordinates of new 
nodes in a growing network by maximizing the likelihood of the network 
snapshot in the model. We apply HyperMap to the Autonomous Systems (AS) 
Internet and find that: 1) the method produces meaningful results, 
identifying soft communities of ASes belonging to the same geographic 
region; 2) the method has a remarkable predictive power: Using the 
resulting map, we can predict missing links in the Internet with high 
precision, outperforming popular existing methods; and 3) the resulting 
map is highly navigable, meaning that a vast majority of greedy 
geometric routing paths are successful and low-stretch. Even though the 
method is not without limitations, and is open for improvement, it 
occupies a unique attractive position in the space of tradeoffs between 
simplicity, accuracy, and computational complexity."

     "description": "Network tarpits, whereby a single host or appliance
 can masquerade as many fake hosts on a network and slow network 
scanners, are a form of defensive cyber-deception. In this work, we 
develop degreaser, an efficient fingerprinting tool to remotely detect 
tarpits. In addition to validating our tool in a controlled environment,
 we use degreaser to perform an Internet-wide scan. We discover tarpits 
of non-trivial size in the wild (prefixes as large as /16), and 
characterize their distribution and behavior. We then show how tarpits 
pollute existing network measurement surveys that are tarpit-naive, e.g.
 Internet census data, and how degreaser can improve the accuracy of 
such surveys. Lastly, our findings suggest several ways in which to 
advance the realism of current network tarpits, thereby raising the bar 
on tarpits as an operational security mechanism."

     "description": "In the first months of 2011, Internet 
communications were disrupted in several North African countries in 
response to civilian protests and threats of civil war. In this paper we
 analyze episodes of these disruptions in two countries: Egypt and 
Libya. Our analysis relies on multiple sources of large-scale data 
already available to academic researchers: BGP interdomain routing 
control plane data; unsolicited data plane traffic to unassigned address
 space; active macroscopic traceroute measurements; RIR delegation 
files; and MaxMind's geolocation database. We used the latter two data 
sets to determine which IP address ranges were allocated to entities 
within each country, and then mapped these IP addresses of interest to 
BGP-announced address ranges (prefixes) and origin ASes using publicly 
available BGP data repositories in the U.S. and Europe. We then analyzed
 observable activity related to these sets of prefixes and ASes 
throughout the censorship episodes. Using both control plane and data 
plane data sets in combination allowed us to narrow down which forms of 
Internet access disruption were implemented in a given region over time.
 Among other insights, we detected what we believe were Libya's attempts
 to test firewall-based blocking before they executed more aggressive 
BGP-based disconnection. Our methodology could be used, and automated, 
to detect outages or similar macroscopically disruptive events in other 
geographic or topological regions."

,
     "datePublished": "2014.11",

     "description": "The traditional approach of modeling relationships 
between ASes abstracts relationship types into three broad categories: 
transit, peering, and sibling. More complicated configurations exist, 
and understanding them may advance our knowledge of Internet economics 
and improve models of routing. We use BGP, traceroute, and geolocation 
data to extend CAIDA's AS relationship inference algorithm to infer two 
types of complex relationships: hybrid relationships, where two ASes 
have different relationships at different interconnection points, and 
partial transit relationships, which restrict the scope of a customer 
relationship to the provider's peers and customers. Using this new 
algorithm, we find 4.5% of the 90,272 provider-customer relationships 
observed in March 2014 were complex, including 1,071 hybrid 
relationships and 2,955 partial-transit relationships. Because most 
peering relationships are invisible, we believe these numbers are lower 
bounds. We used feedback from operators, and relationships encoded in 
BGP communities and RPSL, to validate 20% and 6.9% of our partial 
transit and hybrid inferences, respectively, and found our inferences 
have 92.9% and 97.0% positive predictive values. Hybrid  relationships 
are not only established between large transit providers; in  57% of the
 inferred hybrid transit/peering relationships the customer had a 
customer cone of fewer than 5 ASes."

     "description": "We introduce and demonstrate the utility of a 
method to localize and quantify inter-domain congestion in the Internet.
 Our Time Sequence Latency Probes (TSLP) method depends on two facts: 
Internet traffic patterns are typically diurnal, and queues increase 
packet delay through a router during periods of adjacent link 
congestion. Repeated round trip delay measurements from a single test 
point to the two edges of a congested link will show sustained increased
 latency to the far (but not to the near) side of the link, a delay 
pattern that differs from the typical diurnal pattern of an uncongested 
link. We describe our technique and its surprising potential, carefully 
analyze the biggest challenge with the methodology (interdomain 
router-level topology inference), describe other less severe challenges,
 and present initial results that are sufficiently promising to motivate
 further attention to overcoming the challenges."

     "description": "On 26-27 March 2014, CAIDA hosted the sixth 
Workshop on Active Internet Measurements (AIMS-6) as part of our series 
of Internet Statistics and Metrics Analysis (ISMA) workshops. As with 
previous AIMS workshops, the goals were to further our understanding of 
the potential and limitations of active measurement research and 
infrastructure in the wide-area Internet, and to promote cooperative 
solutions and coordinated strategies between academics, industry, 
policymakers, and funding agencies in the area of active Internet 
measurement. This year, we explored capabilities and opportunities for 
network measurement in the wireless domain, and research infrastructure 
to support it. Participants found the workshop content challengingly 
diverse, with substantial knowledge exchange regarding the wireless 
research infrastructure landscape(s) and existing measurement 
capabilities. But attendees agreed that the conversation was only 
beginning, and that some challenges merit further discussion, such as 
finding consensus on standard metrics to measure, and constructing a 
road map for wireless measurement research infrastructure and activities
 for the next decade. This report describes topics discussed at the 
workshop, and summarizes participants' views of priorities for future 
funding as well as follow-on workshops in this area. \r\n\r\nMaterials 
related to the workshop are available at

Utilization"
,
     "datePublished": "2014.10",
     "date": "201410",
     "description": "One challenge in understanding the evolution of 
Internet infrastructure is the lack of systematic mechanisms for 
monitoring the extent to which allocated IP addresses are actually used.
 In this paper we try to advance the science of inferring IPv4 address 
space utilization by analyzing and correlating results obtained through 
different types of measurements. We have previously studied an approach 
based on passive measurements that can reveal used portions of the 
address space unseen by active approaches. In this paper, we study such 
passive approaches in detail, extending our methodology to four 
different types of vantage points, identifying traffic components that 
most significantly contribute to discovering used IPv4 network blocks. 
We then combine the results we obtained through passive measurements 
together with data from active measurement studies, as well as 
measurements from BGP and additional datasets available to researchers. 
Through the analysis of this large collection of heterogeneous datasets,
 we substantially improve the state of the art in terms of: (i) 
understanding the challenges and opportunities in using passive and 
active techniques to study address utilization; and (ii) knowledge of 
the utilization of the IPv4 space."

Congestion"

     "description": "This paper examines the nature of congestion in the
 interior of the Internet: its location and its intensity. We present 
results of a new method for probing the Internet which allows us to 
detect the presence of congestion on specific links. We are particularly
 interested in the links that interconnect ISPs, including what are 
called peering links. There is little data on the extent of congestion 
across interconnection links, leaving users to wonder if peering links 
are properly engineered, or whether they are a major source of problems 
transferring data across the Internet.\r\n\r\nQuestions about congestion
 are an important part of the current debates about reasonable network 
management. Our results suggest that peering connections are properly 
provisioned in the majority of cases, and the locations of major 
congestion are associated with specific sources of high-volume flows, 
specifically from the Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and dominant 
content providers such as Netflix and Google. We see variation in the 
congestion patterns among these different sources that suggests 
differences in business relationships among them. We argue that a major 
goal for the industry is to work out methods of cooperation among 
different ISPs and higher-level services (who may be competitors in the 
market) so as to jointly achieve cost-effective delivery of data with 
maximum quality of service and quality of experience. We discuss some of
 the problems that must be addressed in this coordination exercise, as 
well as some of the barriers.\r\n\r\n"

     "description": "The dynamic nature of the telecommunications 
industry, with its rapidly changing technology and industry structure, 
presents a serious challenge to the theory and practice of regulation, 
which has a slower response time and a tendency to embed assumptions 
about technology and industry into regulation. This paper proposes a 
model that attempts to capture two durable and persistent features of 
today's telecommunications ecosystem: the use of layered platforms to 
implement desired functionality; and interconnection between actors at 
different platform layers.  We use platform theory, and in particular 
theories of multi-sided platforms (MSPs), to focus on key technical and 
business aspects of today's industry. We use an MSP-aware layered model 
of the ecosystem to explore several recent and impending innovations in 
the ecosystem that have been naively conflated with the global Internet,
 illuminate their differences, and describe how regulators could use our
 model to more rigorously consider them. To illustrate its potential as a
 baseline for future research, we briefly consider how this model can 
help scope consistent policy discourse   of   three   policy   
challenges:   specialized   services,   minimum   quality regulations 
(\"the dirt road\" problem), and structural separation.\r\n"

     "description": "Embedded in a challenging legal and historical 
context, the FCC must act in the short term to address concerns about 
harmful discriminatory behavior. But its actions should be consistent 
with an effective, long-term approach that might ultimately reflect a 
change in legal framing and authority. In this comment we do not express
 a preference among short-term options, e.g., section 706 vs. Title II. 
Instead we suggest steps that would support any short-term option chosen
 by the FCC, but also inform debate about longer term policy options. 
Our suggestions are informed by recent research on Internet connectivity
 structure and performance, from technical as well as business 
perspectives, and our motivation is enabling fact-based policy. Our line
 of reasoning is as follows.\r\n\r\n1) Recent discourse about Internet 
regulation has focused on whether or how to regulate discrimination 
rather than on its possible harms and benefits. For four reasons, we 
advocate explicit attention to possible harms, their causes, and means 
to prevent them. First, the court has stated that while the FCC cannot 
ban traffic discrimination unless it reclassifies Internet access 
providers under Title II, the FCC does have the authority  to remedy 
harms. Second, a focus on harms provides a possible way to govern 
specialized services, which are currently not subject to traffic 
management constraints. Third, if the FCC chooses Title II, it will open
 up many  questions about which parts to enforce, which will require a 
discussion of the harms vs. benefits of selective forbearance. Fourth, 
any new regulatory framework would be well-served by a thorough 
understanding of potential harms and benefits that result from behavior 
of various actors.\r\n\r\n2) Impaired quality of experience (QoE) is a 
meaningful indicator of harm, essential to effective regulatory analysis
 focused on harms, but not well-understood. Unfortunately, tools to 
measure and analyze QoE today are primitive, which is a key obstacle to 
using it as part of a sound basis for regulation. The FCC should promote
 research, tools and capabilities to measure, quantify, and characterize
 QoE, and explore metrics of service quality that better reflect our 
understanding of QoS and QoE for a range of applications. \r\n\r\n3) 
Interconnection is not separable from discrimination when evaluating 
harmful behavior, since interconnection practices can induce harms 
\r\nthat do not materially differ from those induced by discrimination. 
Different modes of connection raise different potential harms, and an 
overall analysis of such harms can suggest reasonable constraints on ISP
 and edge provider behavior.\r\n\r\n4) One such constraint is that to 
the extent that terminating monopoly ISPs are under no obligation to 
peer, they should have to provide uncongested interconnection (peering 
and transit) links. However, this approach requires cognizance of the 
distinction between small edge providers (\"congestion-takers\") and 
large edge providers (\"congestion-makers\"). That is, large edge 
providers who can send enough traffic volume to induce congestion, must 
responsibly manage their traffic sources and negotiate in good faith for
 direct interconnection or other solutions where appropriate, so that 
ISPs can reasonably fulfill their obligation.\r\n\r\n5) A longer-term 
challenge is to create a regulatory framework that promotes improvements
 in infrastructure performance, robustness, and security while also 
promoting freedom and innovation in a highly  dynamic ecosystem. An 
examination of the Internet ecosystem from an industrial platform 
perspective can  help scope consistent policy discourse, in particular 
around specialized services, and anchor a framework that balances these 
aspirations.\r\n\r\n6) A regulatory requirement for transparent 
consideration of harms and benefits will support any direction the FCC 
chooses This requirement brings four challenges: ensuring such analyses 
are sufficiently detailed to allow independent, third-party evaluation; 
obtaining independent evaluations from objective parties; adapting to 
changing reasonable expectations about QoE over time; and capturing 
specific as well as more general societal harms, such as the effects of 
under-investment in capacity."

has far-reaching implications for how we design, develop, deploy, and

this new architecture, and its basic components and operations. We also 
provide a snapshot of its current design, development status, and

     "description": "Determining the physical locations of Internet 
routers is crucial for characterizing Internet infrastructure and 
understanding geographic pathways of global routing, as well as for 
creating Point-of-Presence (POP) level maps. These tasks require good 
router geolocations.  Yet current commercial geolocation efforts focus 
predominantly on geolocating clients and servers, that is, edge hosts 
rather than routers in the core of the network. In this paper we focus 
on geolocating Internet routers, using a methodology for extracting and 
decoding geography-related strings from fully qualified domain names 
(hostnames). We first compiled an extensive dictionary associating 
geographic strings (e.g., airport codes) with geophysical locations. We 
then searched a large set of router hostnames for these strings, 
assuming each autonomous naming domain uses geographic hints 
consistently within that domain. We used topology and performance data 
continually collected by our global measurement\r\ninfrastructure to 
ascertain whether a given hint appears to co-locate different hostnames 
in which it is found. Finally, generalized  geolocation hints into 
domain-specific rule sets. We generated a total of 1,711 rules covering 
1,398 different domains and validated them using domain-specific ground 
truth we gathered for six domains. Unlike previous efforts which relied 
on labor-intensive domain-specific manual analysis, our process for 
inferring the domain specific heuristics is automated, representing a 
measurable advance in the state-of-the-art of methods for geolocating 
Internet resources."

     "description": "Researchers depend on public BGP data to understand
 the structure and evolution of the AS topology, as well as the 
operational security and resiliency of BGP. BGP data is provided 
voluntarily by network operators who establish BGP sessions with route 
collectors that record this data. In this paper, we show how trivial it 
is for a single vantage point (VP) to introduce thousands of spurious 
routes into the collection by providing examples of five VPs that did 
so. We explore the impact these misbehaving VPs had on AS relationship 
inference, showing these misbehaving VPs introduced thousands of AS 
links that did not exist, and caused relationship inferences for links 
that did exist to be corrupted. We evaluate methods to automatically 
identify misbehaving VPs, although we find the result unsatisfying 
because the limitations of real-world BGP practices and AS relationship 
inference algorithms produce signatures similar to those created by 
misbehaving VPs. The most recent misbehaving VP we discovered added 
thousands of spurious routes for nine consecutive months until 8 
November 2012. This misbehaving VP barely impacts (0.1%) our validation 
of our AS relationship inferences, but this number may be misleading 
since most of our validation data relies on BGP and RPSL which validates
 only existing links, rather than asserting the non-existence of links. 
We have only a few assertions of non-existent routes, all received via 
our public-facing website that allows operators to provide validation 
data through our interactive feedback mechanism.  We only discovered 
this misbehavior because two independent operators corrected some 
inferences, and we noticed\r\nthat the spurious routes all came from the
 same VP. This event highlights the limitations of even the best 
available topology data, and provides additional evidence that 
comprehensive ground truth validation from operators is essential to 
scientific research on Internet topology."

     "description": "This paper explores the potential social impacts of
 Named Data Networking (NDN), a proposed future Internet architecture 
that forwards packets based on data names rather than host addresses. We
 highlight four departures from today's TCP/IP architecture, which 
underscore the social impacts of NDN: the architecture's emphases on 
enabling semantic classification, provenance, publication, and 
decentralized communication. While all of these principles can be 
implemented in the current Internet‛s application layer, NDN enables 
them at the network layer, and thus encourages all applications to 
comport with them. We describe how these changes from TCP/IP will expand
 affordances for free speech, and produce positive outcomes for 
security, privacy and anonymity while raising new challenges regarding 
data retention and forgetting. We describe how these changes might alter
 current corporate and law enforcement content regulation mechanisms by 
changing the way data is identified, handled, and routed across the Web.
 We examine how even as NDN empowers edges with more decentralized 
communication options, by providing more context per packet than IP, it 
raises new challenges in ensuring neutrality across the public network. 
Finally, we introduce openings where telecommunications policy can 
evolve alongside NDN to ensure an open, fair Internet. "

public data available about the interdomain peering ecosytem: PeeringDB,
 an online database where participating networks contribute information 
about their peering policies, traffic volumes and presence at various 
geographic locations. Although established to support the practical 
needs of operators, this data also provides a valuable source of 
information to researchers. Using BGP data to cross-validate three years
 of PeeringDB snapshots, we find that PeeringDB membership is reasonably
 representative of the Internet‛s transit, content, and access providers
 in terms of business types and geography of participants, and PeeringDB
 data is generally up-to-date. We find strong correlations among 
different measures of network size - BGP-advertised address space, 
PeeringDB-reported traffic volume and presence at peering facilities, 
and between these size measures and advertised peering policies. "

     "description": "Peering agreements between Autonomous Systems 
affect not only the flow of interdomain traffic but also the economics 
of the entire Internet ecosystem. The conventional wisdom is that 
transit providers are selective in choosing their settlement-free peers 
because they prefer to offer revenue-generating transit service to 
others. Surprisingly, however, a large percentage of transit providers 
use an Open peering strategy. What causes this large-scale adoption of 
Open peering, especially among transit providers? More importantly, what
 is the impact of this peering trend on the economic performance of the 
population of transit providers? We approach these questions through 
game-theoretic modeling and agent-based simulations, capturing the 
dynamics of peering strategy adoption, inter-network formation and 
interdomain traffic flow. We explain why transit providers gravitate 
towards Open peering even though that move may be detrimental \r\nto 
their economic fitness. Finally, we examine the impact of an Open 
peering variant that requires some coordination among providers. "

Traceroute Traces with the IP Timestamp Option"
,
     "datePublished": "2014.3",
     "date": "201403",
     "description": "Artifacts in traceroute measurement output can lead
 to false inferences of AS-level links and paths when used to deduce AS 
topology. One traceroute artifact is caused by routers that respond to 
traceroute probes with a source address not in the path towards the 
destination, i.e. an off-path address. The most well-known traceroute 
artifact, the third-party address, is caused by off-path addresses that 
map to ASes not in the corresponding BGP path. In PAM 2013, Marchetta et
 al. proposed a technique to detect off-path addresses in traceroute 
paths.\r\nTheir technique assumed that a router IP address reported in a
 traceroute path towards a destination was off-path if, in a subsequent 
probe towards the same destination, the router did not insert a 
timestamp into a pre-specified timestamp option in the probe‛s IP 
header. However, no standard precisely defines how routers should handle
 the pre-specified timestamp option, and implementations are 
inconsistent. Marchetta et al. claimed that most IP addresses in a 
traceroute path are off-path, and that consecutive off-path addresses 
are common. They reported no\r\nvalidation of their results. We 
cross-validate their approach with a first-principles approach, rooted 
in the assumption that subnets between connected routers are often /30 
or /31 because routers are often connected with point-to-point links. We
 infer if an address in a traceroute path corresponds to the interface 
on a router that received the packet (the inbound interface) by 
attempting to infer if its /30 or /31 subnet mate is an alias of the 
previous hop. We traceroute from 8 Ark monitors to 80K randomly chosen 
destinations, and find that most observed addresses are configured on 
the in-bound interface on a point-to-point link connecting two routers, 
i.e. are on-path. Because the technique from reports 70.9%—74.9% of 
these addresses as being off-path, we conclude it is not reliable at 
inferring which addresses are off-path or third-party. "

     "description": "An IP darkspace is a globally routed IP address 
space with no active hosts. All traffic destined to darkspace addresses 
is unsolicited and often originates from network scanning or attacks. A 
sudden increases of different types of darkspace traffic can serve as 
indicator of new vulnerabilities, misconfigurations or large scale 
attacks. In our analysis we take advantage of the fact that darkspace 
traffic typically originates from processes that use randomly chosen 
addresses or ports (e.g. scanning) or target a specific address or port 
(e.g. DDoS, worm spreading). These behaviors induce a concentration or 
dispersion in feature distributions of the resulting traffic aggregate 
and can be distinguished using entropy as a compact representation. Its 
lightweight, unambiguous, and privacy-compatible character makes entropy
 a suitable metric that can facilitate early warning capabilities, 
operational information exchange among network operators, and comparison
 of analysis results among a network of distributed IP darkspaces."

designed TIE‛s architecture and functionalities focusing on the 
evaluation, comparison, and combination of different traffic

 previously captured traffic traces. Through scientific collaborations,

     "description": "The 95th percentile billing mechanism has been an 
industry de facto standard for transit providers for well over a decade.
 While the simplicity of the scheme makes it attractive as a billing 
mechanism, dramatic evolution in traffic patterns, associated 
interconnection practices and industry structure over the last two 
decades motivates an obvious question: is it still appropriate? In this 
paper, we evaluate the 95th percentile pricing mechanism from the 
perspective of transit providers, using a decade of traffic statistics 
from SWITCH (a large research/academic network), and more recent traffic
 statistics from 3 Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). We find that over 
time, heavy-inbound and heavy-hitter networks are able to achieve a 
lower 95th-to-average ratio than heavy-inbound and moderate-hitter 
networks, possibly due to their ability to better manage their traffic 
profile. The 95th percentile traffic volume also does not necessarily 
reflect the cost burden to the provider, motivating our exploration of 
an alternative metric that better captures the costs imposed on a 
network. We define the provision ratio for a customer, which captures 
its contribution to the provider‛s peak load."

     "description": "One challenge in understanding the evolution of 
Internet infrastructure is the lack of systematic mechanisms for 
monitoring the extent to which allocated IP addresses are actually used.
 Address utilization has been monitored via actively scanning the entire
 IPv4 address space. We evaluate the potential to leverage passive 
network traffic measurements in addition to or instead of active 
probing. Passive traffic measurements introduce no network traffic 
overhead, do not rely on unfiltered responses to probing, and could 
potentially apply to IPv6 as well. We investigate two challenges in 
using passive traffic for address utilization inference: the limited 
visibility of a single observation point; and the presence of spoofed IP
 addresses in packets that can distort results by implying faked 
addresses are active. We propose a methodology for removing such spoofed
 traffic on both darknets and live networks, which yields results 
comparable to inferences made from active probing. Our preliminary 
analysis reveals a number of promising findings, including novel insight
 into the usage of the IPv4 address space that would expand with 
additional vantage points."

     "description": "In the mid 2000s there was some concern in the 
research and operational communities over the scalability of BGP, the 
Internet‛s interdomain routing protocol. The focus was on update churn 
(the number of routing protocol messages that are exchanged when the 
network undergoes routing changes) and whether churn was growing too 
fast for routers to handle. Recent work somewhat allayed those fears, 
showing that update churn grows slowly in IPv4, but the question of 
routing scalability has re-emerged with IPv6. In this work, we develop a
 model that expresses BGP churn in terms of four measurable properties 
of the routing system. We show why the number of updates normalized by 
the size of the topology is constant, and why routing dynamics are 
qualitatively similar in IPv4 and IPv6. We also show that the 
exponential growth of IPv6 churn is entirely expected, as the underlying
 IPv6 topology is also growing exponentially."

from difficulties in the discovery of p2p links, and is amplified\r\nby 
the increasing popularity of Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) to support 
peering interconnection. We describe,\r\nimplement, and validate a 
method for discovering currently invisible IXP peering links by mining 
BGP communities\r\nused by IXP route servers to implement multilateral 
peering (MLP), including communities that signal the intent to restrict 
announcements to a subset of participants at a given IXP. Using route 
server data juxtaposed with a mapping of\r\nBGP community values, we can
 infer 206K p2p links from 13 large European IXPs, four times more p2p 
links than what is directly observable in public BGP data. The 
advantages of the proposed technique are threefold. First, it utilizes 
existing BGP data sources and does not require the deployment of 
additional vantage points nor the acquisition of private data. Second, 
it requires only a few active queries, facilitating repeatability of the
 measurements. Finally, it offers a new source of data regarding the 
dense establishment of MLP at IXPs."

     "description": "In February 2011 the Internet Assigned Numbers 
Authority (IANA) exhausted its free pool of IPv4 addresses, and the 
regional registries (RIRs) have started to run out of IPv4 addresses as 
well. As RIRs have started rationing allocations, IPv4 transfer markets 
have emerged as a new mechanism to acquire IPv4 addresses. Barring a few
 high-profile exceptions, IPv4 transfers have largely flown under the 
radar. In this work, we use the lists of transfers published by three 
RIRs to characterize the transfer market - the types of players 
involved, the sizes and characteristics of transferred address blocks, 
and the visibility of transferred address blocks in the routing table 
before and after the transfer. Next, we take first steps toward 
detecting address transfers using BGP data from the Routeviews and RIPE 
repositories from 2004-2013. We identify reasons why legitimate changes 
in prefix origin could be mistakenly inferred to be transfers, and 
implement a series of 10 filters that remove 86% of candidate transfers.
 Our results indicate that BGP-based detection of transfers is prone to 
false positives due to significant noise in BGP data, while some 
transfers remain undetectable as they involve non-BGP speakers. We 
describe some additional data sources and analysis techniques that may 
help reveal an opaque market for IPv4 address block transfers."

Communication Technology Research: A Companion to the Menlo Report"

     "description": "Researchers are faced with time-driven competitive 
pressures to research and publish, to achieve tenure, and to deliver on 
grant funding proposals. That ethical considerations can be incongruent 
with these incentives is neither novel nor unique to information and 
communication technology (ICT) research. Those conducting ICT research 
(ICTR) do, however, face a different breed of tensions that can impact 
research ethics risks. Unfortunately, institutionalized guidance on the 
protection of research subjects has not kept pace with the rapid 
transformations  in information technology and infrastructure that have 
catalyzed changes in research substance and mechanics. \r\n\r\nThe Menlo
 Report summarizes a set of basic principles to guide the identification
 and resolution of ethical issues in research about or involving ICT. It
 illuminates a need to interpret and extend traditional ethical 
principles to enable ICT researchers and oversight entities to 
appropriately and consistently assess and render ethically defensible 
research. The framework it proposes can support current and potential 
institutional mechanisms that are well served to implement and enforce 
these principles, such as a research ethics board (REB). The Menlo 
Report is not an official policy statement of the Department of Homeland
 Security, but rather, offers guidance primarily for ICT researchers 
in\r\nacademia and the private sector who may be funded by the 
government, as well as corporate and independent researchers, 
professional societies, publication review committees, and funding 
agencies.\r\n\r\nThis Companion is a complement to the Menlo Report that
 details the principles and applications more granularly and illustrates
 their implementation in real and synthetic case studies. It is 
fundamentally intended for the benefit of society, by illuminating the 
potential for harm to humans (either directly or indirectly) and by 
helping researchers understand and preempt or minimize these risks in 
the lifecycle of their research. "

     "description": "Impediments to resolving IPv6 router aliases have 
precluded understanding the emerging router-level IPv6 Internet 
topology. In this work, we design, implement, and validate the first  
_Internet-scale alias resolution technique_ for IPv6. Our technique, 
_speedtrap_, leverages the ability to induce fragmented IPv6  responses 
from router interfaces in a particular temporal pattern that produces 
distinguishing per-router fingerprints. Our algorithm surmounts three 
fundamental challenges to large-scale IPv6 alias resolution using 
fragment identifier values: (1) unlike for IPv4, the identifier counters
  on IPv6 routers have no natural velocity, (2) the values of these 
counters are similar across routers, and (3) the packet size required to
 collect inferences is 46 times larger than required in IPv4. We 
demonstrate the efficacy of the technique by producing router-level 
Internet IPv6 topologies using measurements from CAIDA's distributed 
infrastructure. Our preliminary work represents a step toward 
understanding the Internet's IPv6 router-level topology, an important 
objective with respect to IPv6 network resilience, security, policy, and
  longitudinal evolution."

     "description": "As the Internet autonomous system (AS)-level 
topology grows over time, some of its structural properties remain 
unchanged. Such time-invariant properties are generally interesting 
because they tend to reflect some fundamental processes or constraints 
behind Internet growth. As has been shown before, the time-invariant 
structural properties of the Internet include some most basic ones, such
 as the degree distribution or clustering. Here, we add to this 
time-invariant list a nontrivial property-- k-dense decomposition. This 
property is derived from a recursive form of edge multiplicity, defined 
as the number of triangles that share a given edge. We show that after 
proper normalization, the k-dense decomposition of the Internet has 
remained stable over the last decade, even though the Internet size has 
approximately doubled, and so has the k-density of its k-densest core. 
This core consists mostly of content providers peering at Internet 
eXchange Points, and it only loosely overlaps with the high-degree or 
high-rank AS core, consisting mostly of tier-1 transit providers. We 
thus show that high degrees and high k-densities reflect two different 
Internet-specific properties of ASes (transit versus content providers).
 As a consequence, even though degrees and k-densities of nodes are 
correlated, the relative fluctuations are strong, and related to that, 
random graphs with the same degree distribution or even degree 
correlations as in the Internet, do not reproduce its k-dense 
decomposition. Therefore an interesting open question is what Internet 
topology models or generators can fully explain or at least reproduce 
the k-dense properties of the Internet."

     "description": "Business relationships between ASes in the Internet
 are typically confidential, yet knowledge of them is essential to 
understand many aspects of Internet structure, performance, dynamics, 
and evolution. We present a new algorithm to infer these relationships 
using BGP paths. Unlike previous approaches, our algorithm does not 
assume the presence (or seek to maximize the number) of valley-free 
paths, instead relying on three assumptions about the Internet's 
inter-domain structure: (1) an AS enters into a provider relationship to
 become globally reachable; and (2) there exists a peering _clique_ of 
ASes at the top of the hierarchy, and (3) there is no cycle of p2c 
links. We assemble the largest source of validation data for 
AS-relationship inferences to date, validating 34.6% of our 126,082 c2p 
and p2p inferences to be 99.6% and 98.7% accurate, respectively. Using 
these inferred relationships, we evaluate three algorithms for inferring
 each AS's _customer cone_, defined as the set of ASes an AS can reach 
using customer links. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithms for 
studying the rise and fall of large transit providers over the last 
fifteen years, including recent claims about the flattening of the 
AS-level topology and the decreasing influence of \"tier-1\" ASes on the
 global Internet."

     "description": "The dynamic nature of the telecommunications 
industry, with its rapidly changing technology and industry structure, 
presents a serious challenge to the theory and practice of regulation, 
which has a slower time scale and a tendency to embed assumptions about 
technology and industry into regulation. This paper proposes a model 
that attempts to capture two durable and persistent features of today‛s 
telecommunications ecosystem: the use of layered platforms to implement 
desired functionality; and interconnection between actors at different 
platform layers. We use platform theory, and in particular theories of 
multi-sided platforms (MSPs), to focus on key technical and business 
aspects of today‛s industry. We use an MSP-aware layered model of the 
ecosystem to explore several recent and impending innovations in the 
ecosystem that have been naively conflated with the global Internet, 
illuminate their differences, and describe how regulators could use our 
model to more rigorously consider them. Finally, to illustrate its 
potential as a baseline for future research, we briefly consider how 
this model can help scope consistent policy discourse of three open 
questions: specialized services, minimum quality regulations (‟the dirt 
road“ problem), and structural separation. "

Workshop on Active Internet Measurements (AIMS-5) as part of our series 
of Internet Statistics and Metrics Analysis (ISMA) workshops. As with 
previous AIMS workshops, the goals were to further our understanding of 
the potential and limitations of active measurement research and 
infrastructure in the wide-area Internet, and to promote cooperative 
solutions and coordinated strategies to address future data needs of the
 network and security operations and research communities. The workshop 
focus this year was on creating, managing, and analyzing annotations of 
large longitudinal active Internet measurement data sets. Due to popular
 demand, we also dedicated half a day to large-scale active measurement 
(performance/topology) from mobile/cellular devices. This report 
describes topics discussed at this year‛s workshop. \r\n\r\nMaterials 
related to the workshop are available at the [ISMA 2013 AIMS-5

Capability on the Internet"

     "description": "The Spoofer project originated in 2005 as the 
result of discussions over the general ability to successfully send 
spoofed-source IP packets across the Internet. At the time, a common 
misconception was that “most networks perform source address filtering, 
and, even if they don’t, botnets remove any of the anonymity advantage 
afforded by spoofing.” Such beliefs of course proved incorrect in light 
of a rash of spoofing-based denial-of-service attacks — attacks that 
still occur to this day. Despite IP source spoofing being a known 
vulnerability for at least 25 years, and despite many efforts to shed 
light on the problem, spoofing remains a viable attack vector for 
redirection, amplification, and anonymity as evidenced most recently and
 publicly in May 2013 during a 300\u002b Gb/s DDoS attack against 
Spamhaus."

     "description": "We present the design and evaluation of ITMgen, a 
tool for generating synthetic but representative Interdomain Traffic 
Matrices (ITMs). ITMgen is motivated by the observation that 
gravity-based models do not reflect application level or regional 
characteristics of Internet traffic. ITMgen works at the level of 
connections, taking into account the relative sizes of ASes, their 
popularity with respect to various applications, and the relation 
between forward and reverse traffic for different application types. The
 necessary parameters for integrating application types and the 
distribution of content popularity can be realistically estimated by 
combining public sources like Alexa that capture traffic trends at a 
macro level with local traffic sampling (NetFlow, DPI) for providing an 
additional enhancement layer at the micro level. Using the above 
philosophy we demonstrate that we can synthesize ITMs that match 
real-world measurements closer than the current state of the art. In 
addition, the modular design philosophy of ITMgen makes it easy to 
integrate additional enhancement layers that improve the accuracy of our
 existing implementation."

     "description": "A critical step in creating accurate Internet 
topology maps from traceroute data is mapping IP addresses to routers, a
 process known as alias resolution. Recent work in alias resolution 
inferred aliases based on similarities in IP ID time series produced by 
different IP addresses. We design, implement, and experiment with a new 
tool that builds on these insights to scale to Internet-scale 
topologies, i.e., millions of addresses, with greater precision and 
sensitivity. MIDAR, our Monotonic ID-Based Alias Resolution tool, 
provides an extremely precise ID comparison test based on monotonicity 
rather than proximity.\r\n\r\nMIDAR integrates multiple probing methods,
 multiple vantage points, and a novel sliding-window probe scheduling 
algorithm to increase scalability to millions of IP addresses. 
Experiments show that MIDAR‛s approach is effective at minimizing the 
false positive rate sufficiently to achieve a high positive predictive 
value at Internet scale. We provide sample statistics from running MIDAR
 on over 2 million addresses. We also validate MIDAR and RadarGun 
against available ground truth and show that MIDAR‛s results are 
significantly better than RadarGun's. Tools such as MIDAR can enable 
longitudinal study of the Internet‛s topological evolution."

     "description": "Internet Background Radiation (IBR) is unsolicited 
network traffic mostly generated by malicious software, e.g., worms, 
scans. In previous work, we extracted a signal from IBR traffic arriving
 at a large (/8) segment of unassigned IPv4 address space to identify 
large-scale disruptions of connectivity at an Autonomous System (AS) 
granularity, and used our technique to study episodes of government 
censorship and natural disasters. Here we explore other IBR-derived 
metrics that may provide insights into the causes of macroscopic 
connectivity disruptions. We propose metrics indicating packet loss 
(e.g., due to link congestion) along a path from a specific AS to our 
observation point. We use three case studies to illustrate how our 
metrics can help identify packet loss characteristics of an outage. 
These metrics could be used in the diagnostic component of a 
semi-automated system for detecting and characterizing large-scale 
outages."

strategies, gives ASes the ability to analyze the impact of each peering
 link on their economic fitness. Using this analysis, ASes engage in 
only those peering relations that can have a positive impact on their 
fitness. "

volume and characteristics of malicious and unwanted traffic as observed
 by a large IPv4 (/8) darkspace monitor over the first six months of 
2012. We did not discover significant changes in overall traffic volume 
following Patch Tuesday, but we found a significant increase of the 
number of active hosts sending to our darkspace monitor the day after 
Patch Tuesday for all six investigated months. Our early results suggest
 the effects of Patch Tuesday are worth deeper investigation. Detecting 
time intervals during which new sources become active can help tune 
sampling methods toward activity periods that likely contain more 
interesting information (i.e., many new malicious sources) than other 
time periods."

     "description": "Our growing dependence on networks has inspired a 
burst of research activity in the field of network science. One focus of
 this research is to derive network models capable of explaining common 
structural characteristics of large real networks, such as the Internet,
 social networks, and many other complex networks. A particular goal is 
to understand how these characteristics affect the various processes 
that run on top of these networks, such as routing, information sharing,
 data distribution, searching, and epidemics. Understanding the 
mechanisms that shape the structure and drive the evolution of real 
networks can also have important applications in designing more 
efficient recommender and collaborative filtering systems, and for 
predicting missing and future links - an important problem in many 
disciplines.\r\n\r\nKrioukov et al. have shown that there are intrinsic 
connections between complex network topologies and hyperbolic geometry, 
since the former exhibit hierarchical, tree-like organization, while the
 latter is the geometry of trees. Following Krioukov et al., 
Papadopoulos et al., have recently shown that trade-offs between 
popularity and similarity shape the structure and dynamics of growing 
complex networks, and that these trade-offs in network dynamics give 
rise to hyperbolic geometry. The work in Papadopoulos et al. introduces a
 simple model for constructing synthetic growing networks in the 
hyperbolic plane, which simultaneously exhibit many common structural 
and dynamical characteristics of real networks. We call the model of 
Papadopoulos et al. the Popularity×Similarity Optimization (PSO) 
model.\r\n\r\nGiven the ability of the PSO model to construct synthetic 
growing networks that resemble real networks across a wide range of 
structural and dynamical characteristics, an interesting question is 
whether one can reverse the synthesis, and given a real network, map 
(embed) the network into the hyperbolic plane, in a way congruent with 
the PSO model. Our main contribution in this work is an affirmative 
answer to this question and a systematic framework that accomplishes 
this task, by replaying the network‛s geometric growth. The proposed 
framework, called HyperMap, is quite simple and it is supported by 
theoretical analysis. We apply this framework to the Autonomous Systems 
(AS) topology of the real Internet and show that it produces meaningful 
results, identifying communities of ASs that belong to the same 
geographic region. Further, we show that the proposed framework has a 
remarkable predictive power, demonstrated by its ability to predict 
missing links with high precision. While we consider here the AS 
Internet topology and the prediction of missing links, there are also 
other interesting areas where the proposed framework could find 
applications, e.g., in community detection, and in the prediction of 
future links."

     "description": "We use historical BGP data and recent active 
measurements to analyze trends in the growth, structure, dynamics and 
performance of the evolving IPv6 Internet, and compare them to the 
evolution of IPv4. We find that the IPv6 network is maturing, albeit 
slowly. While most core Internet transit providers have deployed IPv6, 
edge networks are lagging. Early IPv6 network deployment was stronger in
 Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, than in North America. Current IPv6
 network deployment still shows the same pattern. The IPv6 topology is 
characterized by a single dominant player — Hurricane Electric — which 
appears in a large fraction of IPv6 AS paths, and is more dominant in 
IPv6 than the most dominant player in IPv4. Routing dynamics in the IPv6
 topology are largely similar to those in IPv4, and churn in both 
networks grows at the same rate as the underlying topologies. Our 
measurements suggest that performance over IPv6 paths is comparable to 
that over IPv4 paths if the AS-level paths are the same, but can be much
 worse than IPv4 if the AS-level paths differ."

networks is a central problem in network science. Structural and 
dynamical similarities of different real networks suggest that some 
universal laws might accurately describe the dynamics of these networks,
 albeit the nature and common origin of such laws remain elusive. Here 
we show that the causal network representing the large-scale structure 
of spacetime in our accelerating universe is a power-law graph with 
strong clustering, similar to many complex networks such as the 
Internet, social, or biological networks. We prove that this structural 
similarity is a consequence of the asymptotic equivalence between the 
large-scale growth dynamics of complex networks and causal networks. 
This equivalence suggests that unexpectedly similar laws govern the 
dynamics of complex networks and spacetime in the universe, with 
implications to network science and cosmology."

     "description": "Botnets are the most common vehicle of 
cyber-criminal activity. They are used for spamming, phishing, denial of
 service attacks, brute-force cracking, stealing private information, 
and cyber warfare. Botnets carry out network scans for several reasons, 
including searching for vulnerable machines to infect and recruit into 
the botnet, probing networks for enumeration or penetration, etc. We 
present the measurement and analysis of a horizontal scan of the entire 
IPv4 address space conducted by the Sality botnet in February of last 
year. This 12-day scan originated from approximately 3 million distinct 
IP addresses, and used a heavily coordinated and unusually covert 
scanning strategy to try to discover and compromise VoIP-related (SIP  
server) infrastructure. We observed this event through the UCSD Network 
Telescope, a /8 darknet continuously receiving large amounts of 
unsolicited traffic, and we correlate this traffic data with other 
public sources of data to validate our inferences. Sality is one of the 
largest botnets ever identified by researchers, its behavior represents 
ominous advances in the evolution of modern malware: the use of more 
sophisticated stealth scanning strategies by millions of coordinated 
bots, targeting critical voice communications infrastructure. This work 
offers a detailed dissection of the botnet‛s scanning behavior, 
including general methods to correlate, visualize, and extrapolate 
botnet behavior across the global Internet."

Network Telescope (a /8 darknet) revealed a sophisticated botnet 
scanning event that covertly scanned the entire IPv4 space in about 12 
days. We only serendipitously discovered this event while studying a 
completely unrelated behavior (censorship episode in Egypt in February 
2011), but we carefully studied the scan, including validating and 
crosscorrelating our observations with other large data set shared by 
others. We would like to extend these strategies to detect other 
large-scale malicious events. We suspect the fight against malware will 
benefit greatly (and perhaps require) collaborative sharing of diverse 
large-scale security-related data sets. We hope to discuss both the 
technical and the data-sharing policy aspects of this challenge at the 
workshop."

,
     "datePublished": "2012.9",
     "date": "201209",
     "description": "The principle that \"popularity is attractive\" 
underlies preferential attachment, which is a common explanation for the
 emergence of scaling in growing networks. If new connections are made 
preferentially to more popular nodes, then the resulting distribution of
 the number of connections possessed by nodes follows power laws as 
observed in many real networks. Preferential attachment has been 
directly validated for some real networks (including the Internet), and 
can be a consequence of different underlying processes based on node 
fitness, ranking, optimization, random walks or duplication. Here we 
show that popularity is just one dimension of attractiveness; another 
dimension is similarity. We develop a framework in which new connections
 optimize certain trade-offs between popularity and similarity, instead 
of simply preferring popular nodes. The framework has a geometric 
interpretation in which popularity preference emerges from local 
optimization. As opposed to preferential attachment, our optimization 
framework accurately describes the large-scale evolution of 
technological (the Internet), social (trust relationships between 
people) and biological (Escherichia coli metabolic) networks, predicting
 the probability of new links with high precision. The framework that we
 have developed can thus be used for predicting new links in evolving 
networks, and provides a different perspective on preferential 
attachment as an emergent phenomenon."

     "name": "Peering Strategy Adoption by Transit Providers in the 
Internet: A Game Theoretic Approach"
,
     "datePublished": "2012.9",
     "date": "201209",
     "description": "The Internet is composed of tens of thousands of 
Autonomous Systems (ASes)which interconnect with one another through 
customer provider (transit) and settlement-free peering links. Their 
interconnection objectives are a function of their business type e.g., 
transit providers, content providers, enterprise customers etc. In order
 to achieve these objectives the ASes adopt a set of criteria which are 
used to assess potential and existing settlement-free peering 
relationships. These relationships are bilateral in nature, i.e., for 
two ASes x and y to establish a peering relationship, they must satisfy 
each other‛s peering criteria. The set of criteria used by an AS for 
assessing potential peering relationships is referred to as its peering 
policy. We commonly observe three peering policies publicized by ASes in
 PeeringDB, an open portal where ASes voluntarily share information 
about their peering policies, — Restrictive, Selective and Open. These 
peering policies are explained in a later section.\r\n\r\nThe peering 
strategy adoption by ASes of different categories taken from a recent 
snapshot of PeeringDB showed that Open is the\r\ndominant peering 
strategy among all AS categories, with more than 60% of ASes in each 
category using Open peering. The fact that\r\n64% of NSPs (transit 
providers) use Open peering is especially surprising since transit 
providers prefer other ASes as their customers\r\nrather than peers. Why
 do transit providers tend to peer openly? \r\n\r\nIn our work we use an
 agent-based computational model, GENESIS, to study peering strategy 
adoption by transit providers. Our computational model incorporates most
 of the real world constraints e.g., geographic co-location, skewed 
distribution of traffic,\r\neconomies of scale, multiple transit prices 
per AS etc. We employed computational modeling as incorporation of all 
these constraints\r\nin an analytical model quickly renders the model 
intractable. In that work we find that peering decisions are 
interdependent and\r\nmyopic decisions and lack of coordination among 
ASes results in Open peering as an attractor among peering strategies 
for transit\r\nproviders. Interestingly, we observe that this adoption 
of Open peering results in loss of economic fitness for a majority of 
transit\r\nproviders. Further, large scale adoption of Open peering 
results in stable equilibria.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we use game theoretic
 analysis to gain further insight into peering strategy adoption by 
transit providers in the Internet. We employ a much simplified variant 
of GENESIS in our current work to keep the analytical approach 
tractable. Our analytical results corroborate our previous simulation 
based results. Our results show that when transit providers have 
complete information\r\nabout co-located providers they can optimize 
their economic fitness by adopting Selective peering strategy. Further, 
any uncertainty in\r\nthe system causes the providers to gravitate 
towards Open peering, a suboptimal equilibrium."

and Communication Technology Research"
,
     "datePublished": "2012.8",
     "date": "201208",
     "description": "This report proposes a framework for ethical 
guidelines for computer and information security research, based on the 
principles set forth in the 1979 Belmont Report, a seminal guide for 
ethical research in the biomedical and behavioral sciences. Despite its 
age, the Belmont Report‛s insightful abstraction renders it a valuable 
cornerstone for other domains. We describe how the three principles in 
the Belmont report can be usefully applied in fields related to research
 about or involving information and communication technology. ICT 
research raises new challenges resulting from interactions between 
humans and communications technologies. In particular, today‛s ICT 
research contexts contend with ubiquitously connected network 
environments, overlaid with varied, often discordant legal regimes and 
social norms. We illustrate the application of these principles to 
information systems security research — a critical infrastructure 
priority with broad impact and demonstrated potential for widespread 
harm — although we expect the proposed framework to be relevant to other
 disciplines, including those targeted by the Belmont report but now 
operating in more complex and interconnected contexts.\r\n\r\nWe first 
outline the scope and motivation for this document, including a 
historical summary of the conceptual framework for traditional human 
subjects research, and the landscape of ICT research stakeholders. We 
review four core ethical principles, the three from the Belmont Report 
(Respect for Persons, Beneficence, and Justice) and an additional 
principle Respect for Law and Public Interest. We propose standard 
methods to operationalize these principles in the domain of research 
involving information and communication technology: identification of 
stakeholders and informed consent; balancing risks and benefits; 
fairness and equity; and compliance, transparency and accountability, 
respectively. We also describe how these principles and applications can
 be supported through assistive external oversight by ethical review 
boards, and internal self-evaluation tools such as an Ethical Impact 
Assessment.\r\n\r\nThe intent of this report is to help clarify how the 
characteristics of ICT raise new potential for harm and to show how a 
reinterpretation of ethical principles and their application can lay the
 groundwork for ethically defensible research.\r\n"

Workshop on Active Internet Measurements (AIMS-4) as part of our series 
of Internet Statistics and Metrics Analysis (ISMA) workshops. As with 
the previous three AIMS workshops, the goals were to further our 
understanding of the potential and limitations of active measurement 
research and  infrastructure in the wide-area Internet, and to promote 
cooperative solutions and coordinated strategies to address future data 
needs of the network and security operations and research communities. 
This year we continued to focus on how measurement can illuminate two 
specific public policy concerns: IPv6 deployment and broadband 
performance. This report briefly describes topics discussed at this 
year‛s workshop.\r\n\r\nSlides and other materials related to the 
workshop are available at the [ISMA 2012 AIMS-4

activities on the Internet. Discussion topics included: the surprisingly
 stability in the number of BGP updates over time; techniques for 
improving measurement and analysis of inter-domain routing policies; an 
update on Colorado State's BGPMon instrumentation; using BGP data to 
improve the interpretation of traceroute data, both for real-time 
diagnostics (e.g., AS traceroute) and for large-scale topology mapping; 
using both BGP and traceroute data to support detection and mapping 
infrastructure integrity, including different types of of filtering and 
censorship; and use of BGP data to analyze existing and proposed 
approaches to securing the interdomain routing system. This report 
briefly summarizes the presentations and discussions that followed.   "

     "description": "There is much interest in studying the structure 
and evolution of the Internet at the Autonomous System (AS) level. 
However, limitations of public data sources in detecting settlement-free
 peering links meant that prior work focused almost exclusively on 
transit links. In this work, we explore the possibility of studying the 
full connectivity of a small set of ASes, which we call usable monitors.
 Usable monitors, while a subset of the ASes that provide BGP feeds to 
Routeviews/RIPE collectors, are better suited to an evolutionary study 
than other ASes. We propose CMON, an algorithm to classify the links of 
usable monitors as transit or non-transit. We classify usable monitors 
as transit providers (large and small), content producers, content 
consumers and education/research networks. We highlight key differences 
in the evolution of connectivity of usable monitors, and measure 
transitions between different relationships for the same pair of 
ASes.\r\n"

outdated or incomplete, or mix fundamentally different data sources into
 a single topology. \r\n\r\nThese compromises may undermine the fidelity

Interdomain Traffic Matrix (ITM) is fundamental for Internet 
techno-economic studies but challenging due to the lack of adequate 
traffic data. In this work, we utilize a Europe-wide measurement 
infrastructure deployed at the GÉANT backbone network to examine some 
important spatial properties of the ITM. In particular, we analyze its 
sparsity and characterize the distribution of traffic generated by 
different ASes. Our study reveals that the ITM is sparse and that the 
traffic sent by an AS can be modeled as the LogNormal or Pareto 
distribution, depending on whether the corresponding traffic experiences
 congestion or not. Finally, we show that there exist significant 
correlations between different ASes mostly due to relatively few highly 
popular prefixes."

Switching\r\n(MPLS) in the Internet for over a decade. However, its 
impact on Internet topology measurements is not well known,\r\nand it is
 possible for some MPLS configurations to lead to\r\nfalse router-level 
links in maps derived from traceroute data.\r\nIn this paper, we 
introduce a measurement-based classification of MPLS tunnels, 
identifying tunnels where IP hops are\r\nrevealed but not explicitly 
tagged as label switching routers,\r\nas well as tunnels that obscure 
the underlying path. Using a large-scale dataset we collected, we show 
that paths\r\nfrequently cross MPLS tunnels in today‛s Internet: in 
our\r\ndata, at least 30% of the paths we tested traverse an 
MPLS\r\ntunnel. We also propose and evaluate several methods 
to\r\nreveal MPLS tunnels that are not explicitly flagged as such:\r\nwe
 discover that their fraction is significant (up to half the\r\nexplicit
 tunnel quantity) but most of them do not obscure\r\nIP-level topology 
discovery."

 in the Internet"
,
     "datePublished": "2012.3",

     "description": "The Internet is a complex and dynamic 
interconnection of about 40,000 Autonomous Systems (ASes). A link in 
this context represents a business agreement between the corresponding 
two ASes that they can exchange traffic under various policy and 
capacity constraints. Each AS X follows a peering strategy (or ‟peering 
policy“) that is used to determine whether X will accept to peer with 
another AS Y. Even though they vary in their details, most peering 
policies can be grouped in three distinct classes: Restrictive (X peers 
only if necessary to avoid Internet partitioning; typically used by 
Tier-1 transit providers), Selective (X peers only with ASes that have 
comparable traffic volume), and Open (X is willing to peer with 
everyone, except its customers). The conventional wisdom is that transit
 providers use Restrictive or Selective peering, so that they can engage
 other ASes as their customers, and thus increase their transit 
revenues. In the last few years, however, there is evidence that an 
increasing fraction of the interdomain traffic flows through peering 
links between content providers (or CDNs) and access providers that 
serve end users. A major fraction of the Internet‛s traffic thus 
bypasses intermediate transit providers, and flows directly from 
producers to consumers. So, a question that motivated this study is: How
 are transit providers reacting to the previous peering trend?"

     "description": "Research of or involving Information and 
Communications Technology (ICT) presents a wide variety of ethical 
challenges and the relative immaturity of ethical decision making in the
 ICT research community has prompted calls for additional research and 
guidance. The Menlo report, a revisiting of the seminal Belmont report, 
seeks to bring clarity to this arena by articulating a basic set of 
ethical principles for ICT research. However the gap between such 
principles and actionable guidance for the ethical conduct of ICT 
research is large. In previous work we sought to bridge this gap through
 the construction of an ethical impact assessment (EIA) tool that 
provided a set of guiding questions to help researchers understand how 
to apply the Menlo principles. While a useful tool, experiences in the 
intervening years have caused us to rethink and expand the EIA. In this 
paper we: (i) discuss the various challenges encountered in applying the
 original EIA, (ii) present a new EIA framework that represents our 
evolved understanding, and (iii)  retrospectively apply this EIA to an 
ethically challenging, original study in ICTR."

     "description": "During the last decade, unsolicited one-way 
Internet traffic has been used to study malicious activity on the 
Internet. Researchers usually observe such traffic using network 
telescopes deployed on darkspace (unused address space). When darkspace 
observations began ten years ago, one-way traffic was minimal. Over the 
last five years, however, traffic levels have risen so that they are now
 high enough to require more subtle differentiation - raw packet and 
byte or even port counts make it hard to discern and distinguish new 
activities.\r\n\r\nTo make changes in composition of one-way traffic 
aggregates more detectable, we have developed iatmon (Inter-Arrival Time
 Monitor), a freely available measurement and analysis tool that allows 
one to separate one-way traffic into clearly-defined subsets. Initially 
we have implemented two subsetting schemes; source types, based on the 
schema proposed in J. Treurniet's \"A network activity classification 
schema and its application to scan detection\"; and inter-arrival-time 
(IAT) groups that summarise source behaviour over time.\r\n\r\nWe use 14
 types and 10 groups, giving us a matrix of 140 type-and-group subsets. 
Each subset constitutes only a fraction of the total traffic, so changes
 within the subsets are easily observable when changes in total traffic 
levels might not even be noticeable.\r\n\r\nWe report on our experience 
with this tool to observe changes in one-way traffic at the UCSD network
 telescope over the first half of 2011.\r\n\r\nDaily average plots of 
source numbers and their traffic volumes show clear long-term changes in
 several of our types and groups."

Formation, Traffic Flow and Economics"
,
     "datePublished": "2012.3",

     "description": "We propose an agent-based network 
formation\r\nmodel for the Internet at the Autonomous System (AS) 
level.\r\nThe proposed model, called GENESIS, is based on 
realistic\r\nprovider and peering strategies, with ASes acting in a 
myopic and decentralized manner to optimize a cost-related fitness 
function.\r\n\r\nGENESIS captures key factors that affect the network 
formation dynamics: highly skewed traffic matrix, policy-based routing, 
geographic co-location constraints, and the costs of transit/peering 
agreements. As opposed to analytical game-theoretic models, which focus 
on proving the existence of equilibria, GENESIS is a computational model
 that simulates the network formation process and allows us to actually 
compute distinct equilibria (i.e.,\r\nnetworks) and to also examine the 
behavior of sample paths\r\nthat do not converge. We find that such 
oscillatory sample paths occur in about 10% of the runs, and they always
 involve tier-1 ASes, resembling the tier-1 peering disputes often seen 
in practice. GENESIS results in many distinct equilibria that are highly
 sensitive to initial conditions and the order in which ASes (agents) 
act. This implies that we cannot predict the properties of an individual
 AS in the Internet. However, certain properties of the global network 
or of certain classes of ASes are predictable. We also examine whether 
the underlying game is zero-sum, and\r\nidentify three sufficient 
conditions for that property. \r\n\r\nFinally, we apply GENESIS in a 
specific ‟what-if“ question, asking how the openness towards peering 
affects the resulting network in terms of topology, traffic flow and 
economics. Interestingly, we find that the peering openness that 
maximizes the fitness of different network classes (tier-1, tier-2 and 
tier-3 providers) closely matches that seen in real-world peering 
policies."

     "description": "Traffic classification technology has increased in 
relevance this decade, as it is now used in the definition and 
implementation of mechanisms for service differentiation, network design
 and engineering, security, accounting, advertising, and research. Over 
the past 10 years the research community and the networking industry 
have investigated, proposed and developed several classification 
approaches. While traffic classification techniques are improving in 
accuracy and efficiency, the continued proliferation of different 
Internet application behaviors, in addition to growing incentives to 
disguise some applications to avoid filtering or blocking, are among the
 reasons that traffic classification remains one of many open problems 
in Internet research. In this article we review recent achievements and 
discuss future directions in traffic classification, along with their 
trade-offs in applicability, reliability, and privacy. We outline the 
persistently unsolved challenges in the field over the last decade, and 
suggest several strategies for tackling these challenges to promote 
progress in the science of Internet traffic classification."

     "description": "Unsolicited one-way Internet traffic, also called 
Internet background radiation (IBR), has been used for years to study 
malicious activity on the Internet, including worms, DoS attacks, and 
scanning address space looking for vulnerabilities to exploit. We show 
how such traffic can also be used to analyze macroscopic 
Internet\r\nevents that are unrelated to malware. We examine two 
phenomena: country-level censorship of Internet communications described
 in recent work, and natural disasters (two recent earthquakes). We 
introduce a new metric of local IBR activity based on the number of 
unique IP addresses per hour contributing to IBR. The advantage of this 
metric is that it is not affected by bursts of traffic from a few hosts.
 Although we have only scratched the surface, we are convinced that IBR 
traffic is an important building block for comprehensive monitoring, 
analysis, and possibly even detection of events unrelated to the IBR 
itself. In particular, IBR offers the opportunity to monitor the impact 
of events such as natural disasters on network infrastructure, and in 
particular reveals a view of events that is complementary to many 
existing measurement platforms based on (BGP) control-plane views or 
targeted active ICMP probing."

     "datePublished": "2011.11",

     "description": "In the first months of 2011, Internet 
communications were disrupted in several North African countries in 
response to civilian protests and threats of civil war. In this paper we
 analyze episodes of these disruptions in two countries: Egypt and 
Libya. Our analysis relies on multiple sources of large-scale data 
already available to academic researchers: BGP interdomain routing 
control plane data; unsolicited data plane traffic to unassigned address
 space; active macroscopic traceroute measurements; RIR delegation 
files; and MaxMind's geolocation database. We used the latter two data 
sets to determine which IP address ranges were allocated to entities 
within each country, and then mapped these IP addresses of interest to 
BGP-announced address ranges (prefixes) and origin ASes using publicly 
available BGP data repositories in the U.S. and Europe. We then analyzed
 observable activity related to these sets of prefixes and ASes 
throughout the censorship episodes. Using both control plane and data 
plane data sets in combination allowed us to narrow down which forms of 
Internet access disruption were implemented in a given region over time.
 Among other insights, we detected what we believe were Libya's attempts
 to test firewall-based blocking before they executed more aggressive 
BGP-based disconnection. Our methodology could be used, and automated, 
to detect outages or similar macroscopically disruptive events in other 
geographic or topological regions."

,
     "datePublished": "2011.9",
     "date": "201109",
     "description": "Our goal is to understand the evolution of the 
autonomous system (AS) ecosystem over the last 12 years. Instead of 
focusing on abstract topological properties, we classify ASes into a 
number of types depending on their function and business type. 
Furthermore, we consider the semantics of inter-AS links: 
customer—provider versus peering relations. We find that the available 
historic datasets from RouteViews and RIPE are not sufficient to infer 
the evolution of peering links, and so we restrict our focus to 
customer—provider links. Our findings highlight some important trends in
 the evolution of the Internet over the last 12 years and hint at what 
the Internet is heading toward. After an exponential increase phase 
until 2001, the Internet has settled into a slower exponential growth in
 terms of both ASes and inter-AS links. The growth is mostly due to 
enterprise networks and content/access providers at the periphery of the
 Internet. The average path length remains almost constant, mostly due 
to the increasing multihoming degree of transit and content/access 
providers. The AS types differ significantly from each other with 
respect to their rewiring activity; content/access providers are the 
most active. A few large transit providers act as ‟attractors“ or 
‟repellers“ of customers. For many providers, strong attractiveness 
precedes strong repulsiveness by 3—9 months. Finally, in terms of 
regional growth, we find that the AS ecosystem is now larger and more 
dynamic in Europe than in North America."

abandoned any responsibility to present an understanding of the

the U.S. government in the awkward position of trying to tighten the few

issues for the research community and funding agencies. Improved 
understanding of the structure and dynamics of Internet topology, 
routing, workload, performance, and vulnerabilities remains disturbingly
 elusive, in part for lack of realistic and representative datasets 
available to scientific researchers. The dearth is understandable; 
measurement of operational Internet infrastructure involves managing 
more complex and interconnected dimensions than measurement in most 
scientific disciplines: logistical, financial, methodological, 
technical, legal, and ethical. CAIDA has been navigating these 
challenges with modest success fifteen years, collecting, coordinating, 
curating, and sharing data sets for the Internet research and 
operational community in support of Internet science. Our three current 
biggest challenges which we hope to explore at the workshop are: 
sustainable collection, curation, and storage of large volumes of data; 
privacy-respecting sharing; and long-term archiving for 
reproducibility."

Workshop on Active Internet Measurements (AIMS-3) as part of our series 
of Internet Statistics and Metrics Analysis (ISMA) workshops. As with 
the previous two AIMS workshops, the goals were to further our 
understanding of the potential and limitations of active measurement 
research and infrastructure in the wide-area Internet, and to promote 
cooperative solutions and coordinated strategies to address future data 
needs of the network and security research communities. For three years,
 the workshop has fostered interdisciplinary conversation among 
researchers, operators, and government, focused on analysis of goals, 
means, and emerging issues in active Internet measurement projects. The 
first workshop emphasized discussion of existing hardware and software 
platforms for macroscopic measurement and mapping of Internet 
properties, in particular those related to cybersecurity. The second 
workshop included more performance evaluation and data-sharing 
approaches. This year we expanded the workshop agenda to include active 
measurement topics of more recent interest: broadband performance; 
gauging IPv6 deployment; and measurement activities in international 
research networks."

     "description": "Exhaustion of the Internet addressing authority's 
(IANA) available IPv4 address space, which occurred in February 2011, is
 finally exerting exogenous pressure on network operators to begin to 
deploy IPv6. There are two possible outcomes from this transition. IPv6 
may be widely adopted and embraced, causing many existing methods to 
measure and monitor the Internet to be ineffective. A second possibility
 is that IPv6 languishes, transition mechanisms fail, or performance 
suffers. Either scenario requires data, measurement, and analysis to 
inform technical, business, and policy decisions. We survey available 
data that have allowed limited tracking of IPv6 deployment thus far, 
describe additional types of data that would support better tracking, 
and offer a perspective on the challenging future of IPv6 evolution."

     "description": "The Internet topology discovery has been an 
extensive research subject those last years. While the raw data is 
collected using large traceroute campaigns, additional probing and/or 
extensive computation are required to gather subsets of IP addresses 
into single identifiers corresponding to routers. This alias resolution 
process leads to a router level map of the Internet. In this paper, we 
push further the Internet router level mapping with a new probing tool 
called MERLIN. \r\n\r\nMERLIN takes advantage of mrinfo, a multicast 
management tool that silently collects all IPv4 multicast enabled 
interfaces of a router and all its multicast links towards its 
neighbors. Our new probing tool fixes mrinfo technical limitations and 
eases the deployment of multicast probing campaign. We deploy and 
evaluate the performance of MERLIN at large scale. We investigate the 
completeness of MERLIN by providing a lower bound on the proportion of 
information that it may miss. We also demonstrate that the use of 
several vantage points is crucial to circumvent IGMP filtering in order 
to increase the amount of collected routers. MERLIN is a valuable tool 
for the understanding of the router level topology of the Internet. "

     "description": "We attempt a systematic quantitative comparison of 
currently available geolocation service providers. We add depth to 
previous contributions by analyzing inconsistencies across databases for
 different geographic (RIR) regions and organization (Autonomous 
Systems) types. We compare results on a country granularity, using a 
methodology that compares each database against the majority vote across
 all databases with answers for a given IP address. On a finer 
granularity than country, rigorous formal comparison gets trickier. 
Unlike the discrete country labels, coordinates can have nominally 
different values yet still represent approximately the same location, We
 compare the databases at a lat-long granularity using an 80 km 
threshold for two lat-longs coordinates to be in the same geographic 
region. We describe our process for selecting this threshold, and our 
centroid-based algorithm for comparing database lat-long results against
 a majority of responses from the set of databases we evaluated. While 
not a foolproof methodology - the databases could all be converging to 
the same wrong answers over time - it assumes that database providers 
successfully work toward improving the accuracy of their databases over 
time. In the absence of substantial ground truth, our method offers a 
systematic way to study the geolocation databases to reveal insights, 
summarized at the end of the paper. We intend to re-run the comparison 
experiment using additional databases later in 2011; we welcome 
constructive feedback on the methodology so we can further improve our 
next experiment. "

     "description": "A critical step in creating accurate Internet 
topology maps from traceroute data is mapping IP addresses to routers, a
 process known as alias resolution. Recent work in alias resolution 
inferred aliases based on similarities in IP ID time series produced by 
different IP addresses. We design, implement, and experiment with a new 
tool that builds on these insights to scale to Internet-scale 
topologies, i.e., millions of addresses, with greater precision and 
sensitivity. MIDAR, our Monotonic ID-Based Alias Resolution tool, 
provides an extremely precise ID comparison test based on monotonicity 
rather than proximity. MIDAR integrates multiple probing methods, 
multiple vantage points, and a novel sliding-window probe scheduling 
algorithm to increase scalability to millions of IP addresses. 
Experiments show that MIDAR's approach is effective at minimizing the 
false positive rate sufficiently to achieve a high positive predictive 
value at Internet scale. We provide sample statistics from running MIDAR
 on over 2 million addresses, and validate these results against 
available ground truth. Tools such as MIDAR can help preserve 
longitudinal history of the Internet's topological evolution. "

considered self-similar networks include random scale-free graphs with 
given expected node degrees and zero clustering, scale-free graphs with 
finite clustering and metric structure, growing scale-free networks, and
 many real networks. The proof and the derivation of the giant component
 size do not require the assumption that networks are treelike. Our

 hierarchy of nested subgraphs whose average degree grows with their 
depth in the hierarchy. We conjecture that this property is pivotal for 
percolation in networks."

     "description": "Data collected using traceroute-based algorithms 
underpins research into the Internet's router-level topology, though it 
is possible to infer false links from this data. One source of false 
inference is the combination of per-flow load-balancing, in which more 
than one path is active from a given source to destination, and classic 
traceroute, which varies the UDP destination port number or ICMP 
checksum of successive probe packets, which can cause per-flow 
load-balancers to treat successive packets as distinct flows and forward
 them along different paths. Consequently, successive probe packets can 
solicit responses from unconnected routers, leading to the inference of 
false links. This paper examines the inaccuracies induced from such 
false inferences, both on macroscopic and ISP topology mapping. We 
collected macroscopic topology data to 365k destinations, with 
techniques that both do and do not try to capture load balancing 
phenomena. We then use alias resolution techniques to infer if a 
measurement artifact of classic traceroute induces a false router-level 
link. This technique detected that 2.71% and 0.76% of the links in our 
UDP and ICMP graphs were falsely inferred due to the presence of 
load-balancing. We conclude that most per-flow load-balancing does not 
induce false links when macroscopic topology is inferred using classic 
traceroute. The effect of false links on ISP topology mapping is 
possibly much worse, because the degrees of a tier-1 ISP's routers 
derived from classic traceroute were inflated by a median factor of 2.9 
as compared to those inferred with Paris traceroute. "

,
     "datePublished": "2010.12",

     "description": "Recent measurements and anecdotal evidence indicate
 that the Internet ecosystem is rapidly evolving from a multi-tier 
hierarchy built mostly with transit (customer-provider) links to a dense
 mesh formed with mostly peering links. This transition can have major 
impact on the global Internet economy as well as on the traffic flow and
 topological structure of the Internet. In this paper, we study this 
evolutionary transition with an agent-based network formation model that
 captures key aspects of the interdomain ecosystem, viz., interdomain 
traffic flow and routing, provider and peer selection strategies, 
geographical constraints, and the economics of transit and peering 
interconnections. The model predicts several substantial differences 
between the Hierarchical Internet and the Flat Internet in terms of 
topological structure, path lengths, interdomain traffic flow, and the 
profitability of transit providers. We also quantify the effect of the 
three factors driving this evolutionary transition. Finally, we examine a
 hypothetical scenario in which a large content provider produces more 
than half of the total Internet traffic."

,
     "datePublished": "2010.10",
     "date": "201010",
     "description": "Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use complex 
peering policies, stipulating various rules for peering with other 
networks. Peering strategy is often considered a \"black art\" rather 
than science, and the outcome of a peering negotiation can depend on 
factors that are neither technical nor economic. Consequently, ISPs are 
required to make difficult decisions about the set of networks they 
should peer with, and the price they should demand/offer to ensure a 
stable peering link. We propose a quantitative framework for 
settlement-free and paid-peering links, based on the \"value\" of a 
peering link, i.e., the benefit that networks see from that link. We 
first study a solution where a centralized oracle determines a provably 
stable, optimal and fair price for a paid-peering link, based on perfect
 knowledge of the revenues and costs of each network. We next show that 
with perfect knowledge, the centralized solution can be implemented 
individually by the peering networks. We then study the effects of 
inaccurate estimation of peering value by the peering networks. Finally,
 we examine how value-based peering affects the density of peering 
links, the nature of end-to-end paths, and the profitability of various 
network types in the global Internet."

Rapidly growing overheads associated with the primary function of the

 routing architecture may not sustain even another decade. Here we 
present a method to map the Internet to a hyperbolic space. Guided with 
the constructed map, which we release with this paper, Internet routing 
exhibits scaling properties close to theoretically best possible, thus 
resolving serious scaling limitations that the Internet faces today. 
Besides this immediate practical viability, our network mapping method

     "description": "We develop a geometric framework to study the 
structure and function of complex networks. We assume that hyperbolic 
geometry underlies these networks, and we show that with this 
assumption, heterogeneous degree distributions and strong clustering in 
complex networks emerge naturally as simple reflections of the negative 
curvature and metric property of the underlying hyperbolic geometry. 
Conversely, we show that if a network has some metric structure, and if 
the network degree distribution is heterogeneous, then the network has 
an effective hyperbolic geometry underneath. We then establish a mapping
 between our geometric framework and statistical mechanics of complex 
networks. This mapping interprets edges in a network as non-interacting 
fermions whose energies are hyperbolic distances between nodes, while 
the auxiliary fields coupled to edges are linear functions of these 
energies or distances. The geometric network ensemble subsumes the 
standard configuration model and classical random graphs as two limiting
 cases with degenerate geometric structures. Finally, we show that 
targeted transport processes without global topology knowledge, made 
possible by our geometric framework, are maximally efficient, according 
to all efficiency measures, in networks with strongest heterogeneity and
 clustering, and that this efficiency is remarkably robust with respect 
to even catastrophic disturbances and damages to the network structure."

     "description": "The Internet topology discovery has been an 
extensive research subject those last years. While the raw data is 
collected using large traceroute campaigns, additional probing and/or 
extensive computation are required to gather subsets of IP addresses 
into single identifiers corresponding to routers. This process, known as
 alias resolution, leads to a router level map of the Internet. In this 
paper, we push further the Internet router level mapping with a new 
probing tool called MERLIN. MERLIN is based on mrinfo, a multicast 
management tool. mrinfo is able to silently collect all IPv4 multicast 
enabled interfaces of a router and all its multicast links towards its 
neighbors: it does not need or rely on any alias resolution mechanism. 
In addition, MERLIN comes with the advantage of being much more scalable
 than standard data gathering techniques. In this paper, we deploy and 
evaluate the performance of MERLIN. We demonstrate that the use of 
several vantage points is crucial to circumvent IGMP filtering in order 
to collect large amounts of routers. We also investigate the 
completeness of MERLIN by providing a lower bound on the proportion of 
information that it may miss. Finally, our dataset and the MERLIN 
implementation are freely available."

Usage Controls?"
,
     "datePublished": "2010.9",
     "date": "201009",
     "description": "Information privacy (IP) is an evolution of control
 tug-o-war between individual rights and interests, social 
responsibility, and innovation. When users overtly interact with or 
passively engage a website, social networking or otherwise, they enter a
 privacy risk zone. Most often, they cannot be sure whether data is 
surreptitiously being collected, will be used, or further disclosed in 
ways that contravene their privacy preferences. While we have evolved 
the 'state of the art' to obligate sites to disclose their privacy 
collection, use and disclosure policies, protections nevertheless hinge 
on ex ante user trust that websites will walk the talk.\r\n\r\nA privacy
 solution steeped in information use restrictions and obligations can be
 approached by better engineering the identification and application of 
the underlying reasonable expectations upon which our privacy controls 
(laws, policies, standards) operate. I propose that the solution must be
 derived from the nature of the space creating the problem to begin 
with, specifically, that a scale-free problem demands a solution derived
 from scale-free network science.\r\n\r\nIt seems intuitive that privacy
 harms are not tied to whether you're at home, or in a park, with a 
crowd, or in a public phone booth -- yet the trigger for whether we have
 a reasonable expectation of privacy (REP) is still largely tethered to 
the contours demarcating public-private spaces. In general, if one's 
behavior is conducted in 'private' then REP attaches, but if it is 
exposed to the 'public' then surveillance, tracking, collection, and use
 of that information is fair game. How do we play the game, however, 
when our privacy is tethered to information that is decoupled from our 
persons across the Web ecosystem that does not intuitively fall along 
public-private boundaries?\r\n\r\nWe lack a consistent, objective 
measurement for assessing reasonable expectation of privacy and need to 
realign standards and their applications to more empirically reflect the
 contours of the Internetwork environment in which the privacy risks 
occur and privacy interests need protection. This paper proposes a new 
way to domesticate REP by using models from network science.\r\n\r\nThis
 paper advocates approaching this problem from the conceptual strategy 
that information privacy is a complex adaptive system. Other legal 
scholarship has applied this strategy to legal contexts such as 
environmental policy, intellectual property law, common law 
jurisprudence, Internet jurisdiction, and information privacy torts. 
This approach advocates the novel application of network science to a 
broader value that underpins many of our privacy controls-reasonable 
expectation of privacy. It suggests that there is a co-evolution between
 privacy controls (laws, regulations, standards) and informal norms. 
From this position, REP should be both a top-down and bottom-up tenet, 
where social norms of what citizens should reasonably expect to be 
afforded privacy protection should influence our controls, and our 
controls should shape our REP. As such, an information privacy regime 
that is predominated by the latter, governance-imposed notion of REP 
does not objectively reflect the reality of REP 'in the trenches' and 
threatens to institutionalize a fiction that results in inefficiencies 
and disrespect for ordering forces that protect individual rights and 
fosters social good and innovation.\r\n\r\nWe can infer the incongruity 
between legacy-driven measures of REP and the changed normative 
expectations wrought by the Internetwork environment from contemporary 
controversies surrounding online social networking, geo-location based 
services, targeted behavioral advertising, and data anonymization. Using
 a network science model, we may be able to harmonize the understandings
 and applications of REP across associated privacy controls such as the 
4th Amendment, ECPA, FOIA, self-regulatory standards, consumer 
protection regulations, privacy torts, civil discovery rules, and 
private contracts and policies. Finally, network science techniques may 
enable us to operationalize REP into a more predictable, coherent, 
empirical framework for descriptive evidentiary proof and prescriptive 
risk management."

through which people meet, ideas are spread, and infectious diseases 
propagate within a society. Identifying the most efficient \"spreaders\"
 in a network is an important step to optimize the use of available 
resources and ensure the more efficient spread of information. Here we 
show that, in contrast to common belief, the most influential spreaders 
in a social network do not correspond to the best connected people or to
 the most central people (high betweenness centrality). Instead, we 
find: (i) The most efficient spreaders are those located within the core
 of the network as identified by the k-shell decomposition analysis. 
(ii) When multiple spreaders are considered simultaneously, the distance
 between them becomes the crucial parameter that determines the extend 
of the spreading. Furthermore, we find that-- in the case of infections 
that do not confer immunity on recovered individuals-- the infection 
persists in the high k-shell layers of the network under conditions 
where hubs may not be able to preserve the infection. Our analysis 
provides a plausible route for an optimal design of efficient 
dissemination strategies. \r\n"

Annotations for Routers"
,
     "datePublished": "2010.4",
     "date": "201004",
     "description": "To describe, analyze, and model the topological and
 structural characteristics of the Internet, researchers use Internet 
maps constructed at the router or autonomous system (AS) level. Although
 progress has been made on each front individually, a dual graph 
representing connectivity of routers with AS labels remains an elusive 
goal. We take steps toward merging the router-level and AS-level views 
of the Internet. We start from a collection of traces, i.e. sequences of
 IP addresses obtained with large-scale traceroute measurements from a 
distributed set of vantage points. We use state-of-the-art alias 
resolution techniques to identify interfaces belonging to the same 
router. We develop novel heuristics to assign routers to ASes, producing
 an AS-router dual graph. We validate our router assignment heuristics 
using data provided by tier-1 and tier-2 ISPs and five research 
networks, and show that we successfully assign 80% of routers with 
interfaces from multiple ASes to the correct AS. When we include routers
 with interfaces from a single AS, the accuracy drops to 71%, due to the
 24% of total inferred routers for which our measurement or alias 
resolution fails to find an interface belonging to the correct AS. We 
use our dual graph construct to estimate economic properties of the 
AS-router dual graph, such as the number of internal and border routers 
owned by different types of ASes. We also demonstrate how our techniques
 can improve IP-AS mapping, including resolving up to 62% of\r\nfalse 
loops we observed in AS paths derived from traceroutes.\r\n"

     "description": "The Domain Name System (DNS) is a crucial component
 of today.s Internet. The top layer of the DNS hierarchy (the root name-
 servers) is facing dramatic changes: cryptographically signing the root
 zone with DNSSEC, deploying Internationalized Top-Level Domain (TLD) 
Names (IDNs), and addition of other new global Top Level Domains (TLDs).
 ICANN has stated plans to deploy all of these changes in the next year 
or two, and there is growing interest in measurement, testing, and 
provisioning for foreseen (or unforeseen) complications. We describe the
 Day-in-the-Life annual datasets available to characterize workload at 
the root servers, and we provide some analysis of the last several years
 of these datasets as a baseline for operational preparation, additional
 research, and informed policy. We confirm some trends from previous 
years, including the low fraction of clients (0.55% in 2009) still 
generating most misconfigured \"pollution\", which constitutes the vast 
majority of observed queries to the root servers. We present new results
 on security-related attributes of the client population: an increase in
 the prevalence of DNS source port randomization, a short-term measure 
to improve DNS security; and a surprising decreasing trend in the 
fraction of DNSSEC-capable clients. Our insights on IPv6 data are 
limited to the nodes who collected IPv6 traffic, which does show growth.
 These statistics serve as a baseline for the impending transition to 
DNSSEC. We also report lessons learned from our global trace collection 
experiments, including improvements to future measurements that will 
help answer critical questions in the evolving DNS landscape. "

     "description": "We show that complex (scale-free) network 
topologies naturally emerge from hyperbolic metric spaces. Hyperbolic 
geometry facilitates maximally efficient greedy forwarding in these 
networks. Greedy forwarding is topology-oblivious. Nevertheless, greedy 
packets find their destinations with 100% probability following almost 
optimal shortest paths. This remarkable efficiency sustains even in 
highly dynamic networks. Our findings suggest that forwarding 
information through complex networks, such as the Internet, is possible 
without the overhead of existing routing protocols, and may also find 
practical applications in overlay networks for tasks such as 
application-level routing, information sharing, and data distribution. "

     "description": "The assumption of routing symmetry is often 
embedded into traffic\r\nanalysis and classification tools. This paper 
uses passively captured\r\nnetwork data to estimate the amount of 
traffic actually routed\r\nsymmetrically on a specic link. We propose a 
Flow-Based Symmetry\r\nEstimator (FSE)  a set of metrics to assess 
symmetry in terms of\r\nflows, packets and bytes, which disregards 
inherently asymmetrical\r\ntraffic such as UDP, ICMP and TCP background 
radiation. This\r\nnormalized metric allows fair comparison of symmetry 
across different\r\nlinks. We evaluate our method on a large 
heterogeneous dataset,\r\nand confirm anecdotal reports that routing

Internet evolution at the level of Autonomous Systems (ASs). We call our
 model the multiclass preferential attachment (MPA) model. As its name 
suggests, it is based on preferential attachment. All of its parameters 
are measurable from available Internet topology data. Given the 
estimated values of these parameters, our analytic results predict a 
definitive set of statistics characterizing the AS topology structure. 
These statistics are not part of model formulation. The MPA model thus 
closes the \"measure-model-validate-predict\" loop, and provides further
 evidence that preferential attachment is the main driving force behind 
Internet evolution. "

     "description": "We study firm collaborations in the life sciences 
and the information and communication technology sectors. We propose an 
approach to characterize industrial leadership using k-shell 
decomposition, with top-ranking firms in terms of market value in higher
 k-shell layers. We find that the life sciences industry network 
consists of three distinct components: a \"nucleus,\" which is a small 
well-connected subgraph, \"tendrils,\" which are small subgraphs 
consisting of small degree nodes connected exclusively to the nucleus, 
and a \"bulk body,\" which consists of the majority of nodes. Industrial
 leaders, i.e., the largest companies in terms of market value, are in 
the highest k-shells of both networks. The nucleus of the life sciences 
sector is very stable: once a firm enters the nucleus, it is likely to 
stay there for a long time. At the same time we do not observe the above
 three components in the information and communication technology 
sector. We also conduct a systematic study of these three components in 
random scale-free networks. Our results suggest that the sizes of the 
nucleus and the tendrils in scale-free networks decrease as the exponent
 of the power-law degree distribution \u0026#955; increases, and 
disappear for \u0026#955;\u0026ge;3. We compare the k-shell structure of
 random scale-free model networks with two real-world business firm 
networks in the life sciences and in the information and communication 
technology sectors. We argue that the observed behavior of the k-shell 
structure in the two industries is consistent with the coexistence of 
both preferential and random agreements in the evolution of industrial 
networks.\r\n"

     "description": "IP source address forgery, or \"spoofing,\" is a 
long-recognized consequence of the Internet's lack of packet-level 
authenticity. Despite historical precedent and filtering and tracing 
efforts, attackers continue to utilize spoofing for anonymity, 
indirection, and amplification. Using a distributed infrastructure and 
approximately 12,000 active measurement clients, we collect data on the 
prevalence and efficacy of current best practice source address 
validation techniques. Of clients able to test their provider's 
source-address filtering rules, we find 31% able to successfully spoof 
an arbitrary, routable source address, while 77% of clients otherwise 
unable to spoof can forge an address within their own /24 subnetwork. We
 uncover significant differences in filtering depending upon network 
geographic region, type, and size. Our new tracefilter tool for filter 
location inference finds 80% of filters implemented a single IP hop from
 sources, with over 95% of blocked packets observably filtered within 
the source's autonomous system. Finally, we provide initial longitudinal
 results on the evolution of spoofing revealing no mitigation 
improvement over four years of measurement. Our analysis provides an 
empirical basis for evaluating incentive and coordination issues 
surrounding existing and future Internet packet authentication 
strategies. "

     "description": "The coarsest approximation of the structure of a 
complex network, such as the Internet, is a simple\nundirected 
unweighted graph. This approximation, however, loses too much detail. In
 reality,\nobjects represented by vertices and edges in such a graph 
possess some nontrivial internal structure\nthat varies across and 
differentiates among distinct types of links or nodes. In this work, 
we\nabstract such additional information as network annotations. We 
introduce a network topology\nmodeling framework that treats annotations
 as an extended correlation profile of a network. Assuming\nwe have this
 profile measured for a given network, we present an algorithm to 
rescale it in\norder to construct networks of varying size that still 
reproduce the original measured annotation\nprofile.\n\nUsing this 
methodology,we accurately capture the network properties essential for 
realistic simulations\nof network applications and protocols, or any 
other simulations involving complex network\ntopologies, including 
modeling and simulation of network evolution. We apply our approach to 
the\nAutonomous System (AS) topology of the Internet annotated with 
business relationships between\nASs. This topology captures the 
large-scale structure of the Internet. In depth understanding of\nthis 
structure and tools to model it are cornerstones of research on future 
Internet architectures\nand designs. We find that our techniques are 
able to accurately capture the structure of annotation\ncorrelations 
within this topology, thus reproducing a number of its important 
properties in\nsynthetically-generated random graphs.\n"

     "description": "Measuring the global Internet is a perpetually 
challenging task for technical as well as economic and policy reasons, 
which leaves\r\nscientists as well as policymakers navigating critical 
questions in their field with little if any empirical grounding. On 
February 12-13, 2009, CAIDA hosted the Workshop on Active Internet 
Measurements (AIMS) as part of our series of Internet Statistics and 
Metrics Analysis (ISMA) workshops which provide a venue for researchers,
 operators, and policymakers to exchange ideas and perspectives. The 
two-day workshop included presentations, discussion after each 
presentation, and breakout sessions focused on how to increase potential
 and mitigate limitations of active measurements in the wide area 
Internet. We identified relevant stakeholders who may support and/or 
oppose measurement, and explored how collaborative solutions might 
maximize the benefit of research at minimal cost. This report describes 
the findings of the workshop, outlines open research problems identified
 by participants, and concludes with recommendations that can benefit 
both Internet science and communications policy.\r\n\r\nSlides from

intrusion detection research requires traces where some ground truth 
regarding application and protocol is associated with each packet or 
flow. This paper presents the design, development and experimental 
evaluation of gt, an open source software toolset for associating ground
 truth information with Internet traffic traces. By probing the 
monitored host's kernel to obtain information on active Internet 
sessions, gt gathers ground truth at the application level. Preliminary 
experimental results show that gt's effectiveness comes at little cost 
in terms of overhead on the hosting machines. Furthermore, when coupled 
with other packet inspection mechanisms, gt can derive ground truth not 
only in terms of applications (e.g., e-mail), but also in terms of 
protocols (e.g., SMTP vs. POP3).\r\n"

     "description": "Network motifs are small building blocks of complex
 networks, such as gene regulatory networks. The frequent appearance of a
 motif may be an indication of some network-specific utility for that 
motif, such as speeding up the response times of gene circuits. However,
 the precise nature of the connection between motifs and the global 
structure and function of networks remains unclear. Here we show that 
the global structure of some real networks is statistically determined 
by the distributions of local motifs of size at most 3, once we augment 
motifs to include node degree information. That is, remarkably, the 
global properties of these networks are fixed by the probability of the 
presence of links between node triples, once this probability accounts 
for the degree of the individual nodes. We consider a social web of 
trust, protein interactions, scientific collaborations, air 
transportation, the Internet, and a power grid. In all cases except the 
power grid, random networks that maintain the degree-enriched 
connectivity profiles for node triples in the original network reproduce
 all its local and global properties. This finding provides an 
alternative statistical explanation for motif significance. It also 
impacts research on network topology modeling and generation. Such 
models and generators are guaranteed to reproduce essential local and 
global network properties as soon as they reproduce their 3-node 
connectivity statistics. "

Hyperbolic Metric Spaces"
,
     "datePublished": "2009.9",
     "date": "200909",
     "description": "Routing information is the most basic and, perhaps,
 the most complicated function that networks perform. Conventional 
wisdom states that to find paths to destinations through the complex 
network maze, nodes must communicate and exchange information about the 
status of their connections to other nodes. This communication overhead 
is considered one of the most serious scaling limitations of our primary
 communication technologies today, including the Internet and emerging 
wireless and sensor networks.\r\n\r\nIn many other networks in nature 
however, nodes can efficiently communicate, even though they do not 
exchange any information about the current global state of the network 
topology. Milgram's 1969 experiments showed a classic demonstration of 
this surprising effect: humans can find paths to destinations through 
their social acquaintance network, even though no human has global 
knowledge of its structure. Much later, Jon Kleinberg offered the first 
popular explanation. In his model, each node, in addition to being a 
part of the graph representing the global network topology, resides in a
 coordinate space - a grid embedded in the Euclidean plane. The 
coordinates of a node in the plane, its address, abstracts the 
information about the destination in Milgram's experiments. Each node 
knows:\r\n\r\n1.  its coordinates;\r\n2.  the coordinates of its 
neighbors; and\r\n3.  the coordinates of the destination written on the 
packet. Given these three pieces of information, the node can route 
greedily by selecting its direct neighbor closest to the destination in 
the plane.\r\n\r\nClearly, the described greedy forwarding strategy can 
be efficient only if the network topology is in some way congruent with 
the underlying space. Therefore, the Kleinberg model stands closer to 
the beginning of an explanation for Milgram's experiment than to its 
end. The model does not (try to) reproduce the basic topological 
properties of social networks through which messages were traveling in 
Milgram's experiments. For instance, the Kleinberg model produces only 
k-regular graphs while social networks, the Internet, and many other 
complex networks are known to be scale-free, meaning that:\r\n\r\n1. the
 distribution P(k) of node degrees k in a network follows power laws 
P(k) ~ k^y with exponent y often lying between 2 and 3; and\r\n2. the 
network has strong clustering, i.e., a large number of triangular 
subgraphs.\r\n\r\nOur work follows Kleinberg's formalism. We assume that
 nodes in the Internet and other complex networks exist in some spaces 
that underlie the observed network topologies. We call these spaces 
hidden metric spaces. The observed network topology is coupled to the 
hidden space geometry in the following way: a link between two nodes in 
the topology exists with a certain probability that depends on the 
distance between two nodes in the hidden geometry. One possible and 
plausible explanation for the Kleinberg model's inability to naturally 
produce scale-free topologies is that the spaces hidden beneath the 
Internet and other real networks are not Euclidean planes. The main 
results of our work is that if we model hidden spaces as non-Euclidean 
hyperbolic spaces, then their negative curvature leads to:\r\n\r\n1. 
natural emergence of scale-free topologies constructed over such hidden 
spaces; and\r\n2. extremely efficient greedy forwarding on these 
topologies, achieving almost 100% reachability and optimal (i.e., 
shortest) path lengths, even under dynamic network conditions.\r\n"

 to estimate node similarities. Space expands exponentially in 
hyperbolic geometry, and scale-free topologies emerge as a consequence 
of this exponential expansion. Fermi-Dirac statistics connects observed 
topology to hidden geometry: observed edges are fermions, hidden 
distances are their energies; the curvature of the hidden space affects 
the heterogeneity of the degree distribution, while clustering is a 
function of temperature. Understanding the connection between topology 
and geometry of complex networks contributes to studying the efficiency 
of their functions, and may find practical applications in many 
disciplines, ranging from Internet routing to brain, cell signaling, or 
protein folding research. "

network topologies naturally emerge from hyperbolic metric spaces. 
The\r\nhyperbolic geometry can be used to facilitate maximally efficient
 greedy forwarding on these topologies where packets can find\r\ntheir 
destinations with 100% probability following almost optimal, i.e., 
shortest paths, without the need for global topology\r\nknowledge. We 
demonstrate that this remarkable efficiency is robust under dynamic 
network conditions. Our findings suggest that\r\nforwarding information 
through complex networks, e.g., like the Internet, may be possible 
without the current overhead of routing\r\nprotocols, and may also find 
practical applications in overlay networks for tasks such as

The average length of the shortest paths in networks of size N scales as
 lnlnN. Here we show that these ultrasmall worlds can be navigated in 
ultrashort time. Greedy routing on scale-free networks embedded in 
metric spaces finds paths with the average length scaling also as lnlnN.
 Greedy routing uses only local information to navigate a network. 
Nevertheless, it finds asymptotically the shortest paths, a direct 
computation of which requires global topology knowledge. Our findings 
imply that the peculiar structure of complex networks ensures that the 
lack of global topological awareness has asymptotically no impact on the
 length of communication paths. These results have important 
consequences for communication systems such as the Internet, where 
maintaining knowledge of current topology is a major scalability 
bottleneck. \r\n"

 phenomenon in both natural and manmade complex systems. When each node

 communication paths is merely a matter of distributed computation. 
However, in many real networks nodes communicate efficiently even 
without such global intelligence. Here we show that the peculiar 
structural characteristics of observable complex networks are exactly 
the characteristics needed to maximize their communication efficiency 
without global knowledge. We also describe a general mechanism that 
explains this connection between network structure and function. This 
mechanism relies on the presence of a metric space hidden behind an 
observable network. Our findings suggest that real networks in nature 
have underlying metric spaces that remain undiscovered. Their discovery 
would have enormous practical applications ranging from routing in the 
Internet and searching social networks, to studying information flows in
 neural, gene regulatory networks, or signaling pathways.\r\n"

     "description": "Recent research on Internet traffic classification 
algorithms has yielded a flurry of proposed approaches for 
distinguishing types of traffic, but no systematic comparison of the 
various algorithms. This fragmented approach to traffic classification 
research leaves the operational community with no basis for consensus on
 what approach to use when, and how to interpret results. In this work 
we critically revisit traffic classification by conducting a thorough 
evaluation of three classification approaches, based on transport layer 
ports, host behavior, and flow features. A strength of our work is the 
broad range of data against which we test the three classification 
approaches: seven traces with payload collected in Japan, Korea, and the
 US. The diverse geographic locations, link characteristics and 
application traffic mix in these data allowed us to evaluate the 
approaches under a wide variety of conditions. We analyze the advantages
 and limitations of each approach, evaluate methods to overcome the 
limitations, and extract insights and recommendations for both the study
 and practical application of traffic classification. We make our 
software, classifiers, and data available for researchers interested in 
validating or extending this work.\r\n\r\n"

     "description": "As the Internet has become critical infrastructure 
penetrating many aspects of modern society, a better understanding of 
its behavior is of great interest to a range of fields from science to 
public policy. Characteristic patterns of Internet often vary with 
geography, and coherent study of these geographical trends is important 
to optimizing operations, engineering, and capacity and service 
planning. However, the massive volumes of data, and its wide geographic 
dispersion challenge common mapping and visualizing techniques. In this 
paper, we present a novel visualization technique -- the Influence Map 
-- which renders a compressed representation of geospatially distributed
 Internet data.\r\n\r\nWe apply this new technique to illustrate the 
behavior of a critical Internet service -- specifically, the observed 
interactions between DNS root name servers and their clients. Efficient 
visualizations of these datasets reveal relationships between Internet 
services and users on a macroscopic scale and improve our ability to 
model geography-related Internet features. "

designed to perform better in a scenario where another fails.  This 
paper examines the effects that the choice of probe method has on the 
inferred forward IP path by comparing the paths inferred with UDP, ICMP,
 and TCP-based traceroute methods to (1) a list of routable IP 
addresses, (2) a list of known routers, and (3) a list of well-known 
websites.  We further compare methods by examining seven months of 
macroscopic Internet topology data collected by CAIDA's Archipelago 
infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWe found significant differences in the topology 
observed using different probe methods.  In particular, we found that 
ICMP-based traceroute methods tend to successfully reach more 
destinations, as well as collect evidence of a greater number of AS 
links. UDP-based methods infer the greatest number of IP links, despite 
reaching the fewest destinations.  We hypothesise that some per-flow 
load balancers implement different forwarding policies for TCP and UDP, 
and run a specific experiment to confirm this hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

     "description": "We analyzed the largest simultaneous collection of 
full-payload packet traces from a core component of the global Internet 
infrastructure ever made available to academic researchers. Our dataset 
consists of three large samples of global DNS traffic collected during 
three annual 'Day in the Life of the Internet' (DITL) experiments in 
January 2006, January 2007, and March 2008. Building on our previous 
comparison of DITL 2006 and DITL 2007 DNS datasets [28], we venture to 
extract historical trends, comparisons with other data sources, and 
interpretations, including traffic growth, usage patterns, impact of 
anycast distribution, and persistent problems in the root nameserver 
system that reflect ominously on the global Internet. Most notably, the 
data consistently reveals an extraordinary amount of DNS pollution - an 
estimated 98% of the traffic at the root servers should not be there at 
all. Unfortunately, there is no clear path to reducing the pollution, so
 root server operators, and those who finance them, must perpetually 
overprovision to handle this pollution. Our study presents the most 
complete characterization to date of traffic reaching the roots, and 
while the study does not adequately fulfill the 'Day in the Life of the 
Internet' vision, it does succeed at unequivocally demonstrating that 
the infrastructure on which we are all now betting our professional, 
personal, and political lives deserves a closer and more scientific 
look.\r\n"

     "description": "The complexity and dynamics of Border Gateway 
Protocol (BGP), the only inter-domain routing protocol available for the
 Internet, is driving the need for efficient, scalable, realistic and 
meaningful network simulations. To properly simulate the behavior of BGP
 as currently deployed, one requires both a realistic topology and a 
realistic model of BGP. Although a large number of topology generators 
are available, they have limitations in either their scalability or in 
the ability to model AS relationships. In this work, we describe the 
methodology employed to efficiently construct meaningful large scale 
simulations of the order of a several thousand autonomous systems using 
parallel and distributed simulations thereby leveraging the power of 
multiprocessors and clusters of workstations. Using the Georgia Tech 
Network Simulator (GTNetS) as the framework, we simulate a realistic 
topology constructed from the BGP routing table updates collected by 
RouteViews and further incorporate the policy constraints based on the 
autonomous systems relationships inferred by the Cooperative Association
 for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA). Our BGP model (called 
BGP\u002b\u002b) found in GTNetS is built from the open source Zebra BGP
 implementation, which is deployed in a number of existing Internet 
Autonomous Systems. Using BGP\u002b\u002b and our topology generation 
methods, we show how the simulations can be used to study the effect of 
using BGP anycasting at DNS root servers on the several BGP metrics, 
including convergence time and churn.\n"

     "description": "We study the following paradox associated with 
networks growing according to super-linear preferential attachment: 
super-linear preference cannot produce scale-free networks in the 
thermodynamic limit, but there are super-linearly growing network models
 that perfectly match the structure of some real scale-free networks, 
such as the Internet. We calculate the degree distribution in 
super-linearly growing networks with arbitrary average degree, and 
confirm that in the true thermodynamic limit, these networks are indeed 
degenerate, i.e., almost all nodes have low degrees. We then show that 
super-linear growth has vast pre-asymptotic regimes whose depths depend 
both on the average degree in the network and on how super-linear the 
preference kernel is. We demonstrate that a super-linearly growing 
network model can reproduce, in its pre-asymptotic regime, the structure
 of a real network, if the model captures some sufficiently strong 
structural constraints -- rich-club connectivity, for example. These 
findings suggest that real scale-free networks of finite size may exist 
in pre-asymptotic regimes of network evolution processes that lead to 
degenerate network formations in the thermodynamic limit.\r\n"

future.\r\nBut while the situation overwhelmingly indicates the\r\nneed 
for a closer objective look, the only people with\r\nmeasurement 
capability on publicly accessible network\r\ninfrastructure today are 
tasked with inferring as much\r\nprivate information on individual users
 as possible --\r\nwhether it's to target terrorists or ads. The 
traditional\r\nmode of getting data from public infrastructures 
to\r\ninform policymaking -- regulating its collection -- \r\nis a 
quixotic path, since the government regulatory\r\nagencies have as much 
reason to be reluctant as providers\r\nregarding disclosure of how the 
Internet is engineered,\r\nused, and financed. Less surprising with 
hindsight, the\r\nopaqueness of the infrastructure to empirical 
analysis\r\nhas generated many problematic responses from 
rigidly\r\ncircumscribed communities trying to get their jobs 
done.\r\nAs dismal as it sounds though, the news is not all bad 
--\r\nthere is a reason everyone wants to be connected to all\r\nthe 
world's knowledge, as well as eachother, besides its\r\nstatus as the 
most powerful complex system ever created\r\nby man. The Internet's 
practical promise for individual\r\nfreedom, democratic engagement, and 
economic empowerment\r\nis also unparalleled. Moreover, even in the dim 
light of\r\nthe profoundly needed but underattended 
interdisciplinary\r\nresearch into the network, we can ascertain some 
concrete\r\nconstraints on the possible range of policy 
solutions,\r\nwhich all involve increasing the congruity between 
what\r\nwe legislate and what we know.\r\n\r\nPrimary Subject Area:   
\r\n1. Network Competition, Policy and Management\r\n\r\nSecondary 
Subject Areas:        \r\n2. Next Generation and all-IP Networks: 
Policy, Regulatory, Architectural\r\nand Societal Issues  \r\n"

     "description": "Over the past several years, interest in municipal 
wireless and community networking has increased dramatically.  Thus far,
 these initiatives have generally focused on networking local 
communities. The next evolution in network-ing involves peering these 
networks together.  Research on broadband service provision is 
desperately needed to help forge new national telecommunications 
policies and inspire innovation in networking technologies.\n\nWith this
 goal in mind, the Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis 
(CAIDA) held a workshop to discuss -- and ultimately propose -- 
collaboration among researchers and networks to simultaneously solve 
three acute and growing problems facing the Internet. First, there 
exists a self-reported financial crisis in the Internet infrastructure 
provider industry that poses a threat to broadband growth and American 
competitiveness. Second, a data acquisition crisis has stunted the field
 of network science. Finally, emerging community, municipal, regional, 
and state networks need additional broadband connectivity but face 
limited provider, service level, and usage options.\n\nThe Cooperative 
Measurement and Modeling of Open Networked Systems (COMMONS) Initiative 
proposes to build or partner with a collaborative national backbone to 
connect participating community, municipal, regional, and state networks
 to one another and to the global Internet. The COMMONS provides a 
platform for Internet researchers to study this infrastructure. It also 
provides a low-cost medium for networks to peer with one another. This 
approach will provide vital research results for policymakers across the
 country and around the world.\n\nPart II of this article describes the 
findings from the initial COMMONS Strategy Workshop held in December 
2006. Part III outlines relevant open research problems identified by 
the participants. Part IV proposes a framework for the end-to-end 
interconnection of networks at all levels on a national scale. Finally, 
the article concludes with a discussion of the steps necessary to bring 
about such a networking arrangement. Further, this section highlights 
the potential benefits to the scientific community, network operators 
and developers, key decision makers, and the general public.\n"

greedy routing on this embedding is efficient for these topologies,

Clustering, i.e., cycles of length three, plays a crucial role in 
this\r\nframework as a topological reflection of the triangle inequality
 in the hidden geometry. We prove that\r\na class of hidden variable

 Our findings indicate that hidden\r\ngeometries underlying these real

     "description": "Researchers involved in designing network services 
and protocols rely on results from simulation and emulation environments
 to evaluate correctness, performance and scalability. To better 
understand the behavior of these applications and to predict their 
performance when deployed across the Internet, the generated topologies 
that serve as input to simulated and emulated environments must closely 
match real network characteristics, not just in terms of graph structure
 (node interconnectivity) but also with respect to various node and link
 annotations. Relevant annotations include link latencies, AS membership
 and whether a router is a peering or internal router. Finally, it 
should be possible to rescale a given topology to a variety of sizes 
while still maintaining its essential characteristics.\r\n\r\nIn this 
paper, we propose techniques to generate annotated, Internet router 
graphs of different sizes based on existing observations of Internet 
characteristics. We find that our generated graphs match a variety of 
graph properties observed topologies for a range of target graph sizes. 
While the best available data of Internet topology currently remains 
imperfect, the quality of our generated topologies will improve with the
 fidelity of available measurement techniques or next generation 
architectures that make Internet structure more transparent.\r\n"

     "description": "The Internet's routing system is facing stresses 
due to its\r\npoor fundamental scaling properties. Compact routing 
is\r\na research field that studies fundamental limits of 
routing\r\nscalability and designs algorithms that try to meet 
these\r\nlimits. In particular, compact routing research shows 
that\r\nshortest-path routing, forming a core of traditional 
routing\r\nalgorithms, cannot guarantee routing table (RT) sizes 
that\r\non all network topologies grow slower than linearly as 
functions\r\nof the network size. However, there are plenty of 
compact\r\nrouting schemes that relax the shortest-path 
requirement\r\nand allow for improved, sublinear RT size scaling 
that\r\nis mathematically provable for all static network 
topologies.\r\nIn particular, there exist compact routing schemes 
designed\r\nfor grids, trees, and Internet-like topologies that offer 
RT\r\nsizes that scale logarithmically with the network size.\r\n\r\nIn 
this paper, we demonstrate that in view of recent results\r\nin compact 
routing research, such logarithmic scaling\r\non Internet-like 
topologies is fundamentally impossible in\r\nthe presence of topology 
dynamics or topology-independent\r\n(flat) addressing. We use analytic 
arguments to show that\r\nthe number of routing control messages per 
topology change\r\ncannot scale better than linearly on Internet-like 
topologies.\r\nWe also employ simulations to confirm that logarithmic 
RT\r\nsize scaling gets broken by topology-independent addressing,\r\na 
cornerstone of popular locator-identifier split proposals\r\naiming at 
improving routing scaling in the presence of\r\nnetwork topology 
dynamics or host mobility. These pessimistic\r\nfindings lead us to the 
conclusion that a fundamental\r\nre-examination of assumptions behind 
routing models\r\nand abstractions is needed in order to find a routing 
architecture\r\nthat would be able to scale \"indefinitely.\"\r\n"

anycast in order to\r\nimprove their service to clients and increase 
their resilience against\r\nvarious types of failures. We study DNS 
traffic collected over a two-day\r\nperiod in January 2006 at anycast 
instances for the C, F and K root\r\nnameservers. We analyze how anycast
 DNS service affects the worldwide\r\npopulation of Internet users. To 
determine whether clients actually use\r\nthe instance closest to them, 
we examine client locations for each root\r\ninstance, and the 
geographic distances between a server and its clients.\r\nWe find that 
frequently the choice, which is entirely determined by BGP\r\nrouting, 
is not the geographically closest one. We also consider\r\nspecific AS 
paths and investigate some cases where local instances have\r\na higher 
than usual proportion of non-local clients. We conclude that\r\noverall,
 anycast roots significantly localize DNS traffic, thereby\r\nimproving 
DNS service to clients worldwide.\r\n\r\n"

 a surge of interest in computer science, physics, and the mathematical

approach the same problem from different angles. As a result, the field 
of Internet topology analysis and modeling must untangle sets of 
inconsistent findings, conflicting claims, and contradicting 
statements.\r\n\r\nOn May 10-12, 2006, CAIDA hosted the Workshop on 
Internet topology (WIT). By bringing together a group of researchers 
spanning the areas of computer science, physics, and the mathematical 
sciences, the workshop aimed to improve communication across these 
scientific disciplines, enable interdisciplinary crossfertilization, 
identify commonalities in the different approaches, promote synergy 
where it exists, and utilize the richness that results from exploring 
similar problems from multiple perspectives.\r\n\r\nThis report 
describes the findings of the workshop, outlines a set of relevant open 
research problems identified by participants, and concludes with 
recommendations that can benefit all scientific communities interested 
in Internet topology research.\r\n\r\n"

     "description": "Research on performance, robustness, and evolution 
of the global Internet is fundamentally handicapped without accurate and
 complete knowledge of the nature and structure of the contractual 
relationships between Autonomous Systems (ASs). In this work, we first 
examine the state-of-the-art in inferring AS relationships. We carefully
 analyze existing techniques and pinpoint limitations and inadequacies 
associated with them. We then introduce new, improved heuristics 
addressing the problems we have identified. Seeking to increase the 
value and reliability of our inference results, we then proceed to 
direct validation. We perform a survey with ASs' network administrators 
to collect information on the actual connectivity and policies of the 
surveyed ASs. Based on the survey results, we find that our new AS 
relationship inference techniques achieve high levels of accuracy: we 
correctly infer 96.5% customer to provider (c2p), 82.8% peer to peer 
(p2p), and 90.3% sibling to sibling (s2s) relationships. We then 
cross-compare the reported AS connectivity with the AS connectivity data
 contained in BGP tables. We regret to report that BGP tables miss up to
 86.2% of the true adjacencies of the surveyed ASs. The majority of the 
missing links are of the p2p type, meaning that, in reality, peering 
links are likely to be more dominant than have been previously reported 
or conjectured. Finally, to make our results easily accessible and 
practically useful for the community, we open an AS relationship 
repository where we archive, on a weekly basis, and make publicly 
available the complete Internet AS-level topologies enriched with AS 
relationship information for every pair of AS neighbors.\r\n"

convened a workshop to assess the state of networking research, and, in 
pursuit of objectivity and fresh insights, arranged for more than half 
of the attendees to be from other fields, in this case computer science.
 Among the most memorable conclusions: .. the outsiders expressed the 
view that the network research community should not devote all or even 
the majority of its time to fixing current Internet problems. Instead, 
networking research should more aggressively seek to develop new ideas 
and approaches. A program that does this would be centered on the three 
M's - measurement of the Internet, modeling of the Internet, and making 
disruptive prototypes."

     "description": "In the past few years, the network measurement 
community\r\nhas been interested in the problem of internet topology 
discovery using\r\na large number (hundreds or thousands) of measurement
 monitors. The\r\nstandard way to obtain information about the internet 
topology is to\r\nuse the traceroute tool from a small number of 
monitors. Recent papers\r\nhave made the case that increasing the number
 of monitors will give a\r\nmore accurate view of the topology. However,
 scaling up the number of\r\nmonitors is not a trivial process. 
Duplication of effort close to the mon\r\nitors wastes time by 
reexploring well-known parts of the network, and\r\nclose to 
destinations might appear to be a distributed 
denial-of-service\r\n(DDoS) attack as the probes converge from a set of 
sources towards a\r\ngiven destination. In prior work, authors of this 
paper proposed Double\r\ntree, an algorithm for cooperative topology 
discovery, that reduces the\r\nload on the network, i.e., router IP 
interfaces and end-hosts, while dis\r\ncovering almost as many nodes and
 links as standard approaches based\r\non traceroute. This paper 
presents our open-source and freely download\r\nable implementation of 
Doubletree in a tool we call traceroute@home.\r\nWe evaluate the 
performance of our implementation on the PlanetLab\r\ntestbed and 
discuss a large-scale monitoring infrastructure that could\r\nbenefit of
 Doubletree.\r\n"

     "description": "Researchers have proposed a variety of metrics to 
measure important graph properties, for instance, in social, biological,
 and computer networks. Values for a particular graph metric may capture
 a graph's resilience to failure or its routing efficiency. Knowledge of
 appropriate metric values may influence the engineering of future 
topologies, repair strategies in the face of failure, and understanding 
of fundamental properties of existing networks. Unfortunately, there are
 typically no algorithms to generate graphs matching one or more 
proposed metrics and there is little understanding of the relationships 
among individual metrics or their applicability to different 
settings.\r\n\r\nWe present a new, systematic approach for analyzing 
network topologies. We first introduce the dK-series of probability 
distributions specifying all degree correlations within d-sized 
subgraphs of a given graph G. Increasing values of d capture 
progressively more properties of G at the cost of more complex 
representation of the probability distribution. Using this series, we 
can quantitatively measure the distance between two graphs and construct
 random graphs that accurately reproduce virtually all metrics proposed 
in the literature. The nature of the dK-series implies that it will also
 capture any future metrics that may be proposed. Using our approach, we
 construct graphs for d = 0, 1, 2, 3 and demonstrate that these graphs 
reproduce, with increasing accuracy, important properties of measured 
and modeled Internet topologies. We find that the d = 2 case is 
sufficient for most practical purposes, while d = 3 essentially 
reconstructs the Internet AS- and router-level topologies exactly. We 
hope that a systematic method to analyze and synthesize topologies 
offers a significant improvement to the set of tools available to 
network topology and protocol researchers."

 (RFC1918)\r\naddresses, which leaks to global network. This spurious 
traffic not\r\nonly wastes network resources but also jeopardizes 
security and\r\nprivacy of users.\r\nWe first look at the magnitude of 
these updates on two independent\r\nAS112 [1] servers. We then analyze 
which operating systems\r\nare responsible for these updates by using 
three levels of signature\r\ntechniques and find that over 97% of 
updates come from Windows\r\nsystems. While newer versions of Windows 
OSes are more stringent\r\nin sending private DNS updates, we did not 
observe an overall\r\ndecreasing trend due to this evolution. Users, 
software vendors,\r\nand system administrators can take steps to reduce 
this RFC1918\r\ntraffic. However, since most end users are unlikely to 
interfere with\r\nvendor default settings, it should be the

     "description": "The development of realistic topology generators 
that produce faithful replicas of Internet topologies is critical for 
conducting realistic simulation studies of Internet protocols. Despite 
the volume of research in this area the last several years, current 
topology generators fail to capture an inherent aspect of the autonomous
 system (AS) topology of the Internet, namely the fact that AS links 
reflect business agreements between competing entities, which impose 
restrictions on how traffic is routed between ASs. These restrictions 
result in inflated AS paths and generally in suboptimal routing in the 
Internet. In this work, we first evaluate the importance of modeling AS 
relationships when conducting accurate and realistic simulation studies.
 We demonstrate that ignoring AS relationships produces different 
simulation results than modeling AS relationships based on known 
relationships between Internet Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Then, 
we introduce a framework for generating synthetic AS topologies 
annotated with realistic relationships. In addition to modeling the 
degree distribution of a network, which is the property that most 
existing topology generators model, our framework also models new 
properties that capture the characteristics of AS relationships. 
Finally, we propose a novel algorithm for generating synthetic graphs, 
annotated with AS relationships, that reproduce these AS 
relationships-aware properties.\r\n"

     "description": "This paper presents a new, systematic approach to 
analyzing network topologies. We first introduce a series of probability
 distributions specifying all degree correlations within d-sized 
subgraphs of a given graph G. Using this series, we can quantitatively 
evaluate how close synthetic topologies are to G, construct graphs that 
accurately reproduce the values of commonly-used graphmetrics of G, and 
provide a rigorous basis for capturing any future metrics that may be of
 interest. The d = 0 and d = 1 cases reduce to the known classical 
(Erdõs-Rényi) random graphs and random graphs with prescribed degree 
distributions respectively. However, recent research shows that simply 
reproducing a graph's degree distribution is insufficient for capturing 
important properties of network topologies. Using our approach, we 
construct graphs for d = 0, 1, 2, 3 and demonstrate that these graphs 
reproduce, with increasing accuracy, important properties of measured 
and modeled Internet topologies. We find that the d = 2 case is 
sufficient for most practical purposes, while d = 3 essentially 
reconstructs the Internet AS- and router-level topologies exactly. 
Overall, the availability of a systematic method to analyze and 
synthesize topologies offers a significant improvement to the set of 
tools available to network topology and protocol researchers."

     "description": "In the past few years, the network 
measurement\r\ncommunity has been interested in the problem of internet 
topology\r\ndiscovery using a large number (hundreds or thousands) 
of\r\nmeasurement monitors. The standard way to obtain 
information\r\nabout the internet topology is to use the traceroute tool
 from\r\na small number of monitors. Recent papers have made the 
case\r\nthat increasing the number of monitors will give a more 
accurate\r\nview of the topology. However, scaling up the number of 
monitors\r\nis not a trivial process. Duplication of effort close to the
 monitors\r\nwastes time by reexploring well-known parts of the network,
 and\r\nclose to destinations might appear to be a distributed 
denialof\r\nservice (DDoS) attack as the probes converge from a set 
of\r\nsources towards a given destination. In prior work, authors 
of\r\nthis report proposed Doubletree, an algorithm for 
cooperative\r\ntopology discovery, that reduces the load on the network,
 i.e.,\r\nrouter IP interfaces and end-hosts, while discovering 
almost\r\nas many nodes and links as standard approaches based 
on\r\ntraceroute. This report presents our open-source and 
freely\r\ndownloadable implementation of Doubletree in a tool we 
call\r\ntraceroute@home. We describe the deployment and validation\r\nof
 traceroute@home on the PlanetLab testbed and we report\r\non the 
lessons learned from this experience. We discuss how\r\ntraceroute@home 
can be developed further and discuss ideas for\r\nfuture 
improvements.\r\n"

Learning Approach"

     "datePublished": "2006.3",

     "description": "Although the Internet AS-level topology has been 
extensively studied over the past few years, little is known about the 
details of the AS taxonomy. An AS \"node\" can represent a wide variety 
of organizations, e.g., large ISP, or small private business, 
university, with vastly different network characteristics, external 
connectivity patterns, network growth tendencies, and other properties 
that we can hardly neglect while working on veracious Internet 
representations in simulation environments. In this paper, we introduce a
 radically new approach based on machine learning techniques to map all 
the ASes in the Internet into a natural AS taxonomy. We successfully 
classify 95.3% of ASes with expected accuracy of 78.1%. We release to 
the community the AS-level topology dataset augmented with: 1) the AS 
taxonomy information and 2) the set of AS attributes we used to classify
 ASes. We believe that this dataset will serve as an invaluable addition
 to further understanding of the structure and evolution of the 
Internet.\r\n\r\nThe file 
[as2attr.tgz](https://www.caida.org/data/as-taxonomy/as2attr.tgz) 
includes the set of AS attributes we extracted from CAIDA, RouteViews, 
and Internet Routing Registries data. Each line contains the following 
tab delimited fields: 1) AS number, 2) organization description record, 
3) number of inferred providers, 4) number of inferred peers, 5) number 
of inferred customers, 6) equivalent number of /24 prefixes covering all
 the advertised IP space, 7) number of advertised IP prefixes, and 8) 
inferred AS class. The classes are encoded with the following acronyms: 
\"t1\" for large ISPs, \"t2\" for small ISPs, \"edu\" for Universities, 
\"ix\" for IXPs, \"nic\" for NICs, \"comp\" for Customers and 
\"abstained\" for ASes for which the algorithm did not make a 
prediction.\r\n\r\nThe file 
[as_rel.tgz](https://www.caida.org/data/as-taxonomy/as_rel.tgz) includes
 the AS graph annotated with inferred AS relationships. Our inference is
 based on heuristics we developed in our previous work. In particular, 
customer-to-provider relationships are inferred using the methodology of
 the paper [Inferring AS Relationships: Dead End or Lively 
Beginning?](https://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2005/asrelationships/),
 while peer-to-peer links are inferred using the methodology of the 
paper \"AS Relationships: Inferance and Validation\", which is currently
 under submission (we hope to post a link here soon). Each line in 
as_rel.txt is a triplet: A B C, where A B reflects an AS link and C the 
AS relationship: if (C==0) A B is a p2p link; if (C=-1) A is a customer 
of B; and if (C==1) A is a provider of B. Each AS link is listed twice 
as A B and B A. Note that few of the AS numbers listed in as_rel.txt are
 missing from as2attr.txt, since in the latter we include only the AS 
numbers for which all six attributes were available. "

 We discover that traceroute and BGP topologies are similar to one 
another but differ substantially from the WHOIS topology. Among the 
widely considered metrics, we find that the joint degree distribution 
appears to fundamentally characterize Internet AS topologies as well as 
narrowly define values for other important metrics. We discuss the 
interplay between the specifics of the three data collection mechanisms 
and the resulting topology views. In particular, we show how the data 
collection peculiarities explain differences in the resulting joint 
degree distributions of the respective topologies. Finally, we release 
to the community the input topology datasets, along with the scripts and

,
     "datePublished": "2005.11",
     "date": "200511",
     "description": "The development of realistic topology generators is
 a problem that has attracted significant attention the last few years. 
There exist a number of competing approaches to construction of random 
graphs reproducing important properties of real networks. Unfortunately,
 all the existing approaches do not capture an inherent aspect of many 
real networks: links in real networks represent relationships, which can
 be of several types reflecting different properties. Such link type 
inhomogeneity is present in the AS topology of the Internet, which is a 
intermix of customer-to- provider (c2p), peer-to-peer (p2p) and 
sibling-to-sibling (s2s) relationships. It also exists in social 
networks (different types of social relationships), in biological 
networks (different types of protein interactions) and in many other 
real networks. Node relationships not only provide additional 
information on the network topology structure, but more significantly, 
they represent an indispensable aspect of real networks, and this aspect
 needs to be properly modeled for many practical applications. Consider 
for example the case of using synthetic AS topologies to simulate a new 
routing protocol. In order to realistically simulate routing in a 
synthetic AS topology, we need to take into account how policies affect 
routing decisions. However, this is not possible with existing topology 
generators since they solely model the network connectivity properties 
without incorporating any insight about the relationships between nodes.
 In this work we address this problem by introducing a framework for 
modeling different relationships found in real networks. We use our 
framework to model AS relationships in the Internet and to develop an AS
 topology generator that generates AS graphs with realistic connectivity
 properties as well as realistic AS relationships.\r\n"

     "description": "\nThe rapid evolution of large-scale worms, viruses
 and botnets have made Internet malware a pressing concern. Such 
infections are at the root of modern scourges including DDoS extortion, 
on-line identity theft, SPAM, phishing, and piracy.\nHowever, the most 
widely used tools for gathering intelligence on new malware - network 
honeypots - have forced investigators to choose between monitoring 
activity at a large scale or capturing behavior with high fidelity. In 
this paper, we describe an approach to minimize this tension and improve
 honeypot scalability by up to six orders of magnitude while still 
closely emulating the execution behavior of individual Internet hosts. 
We have built a prototype honeyfarm system, called Potemkin, that 
exploits virtual machines, aggressive memory sharing, and late binding 
of resources to achieve this goal. While still an immature 
implementation, Potemkin has emulated over 64,000 Internet honeypots in 
live test runs, using only a handful of physical servers.\n\n"

Although\r\nthe Internet AS topology has been studied extensively, less 
is\r\nknown about the individual ASs, the entities that

AS\r\nnumbers are used by service providers, companies,

Statistical knowledge of the ASs in the Internet is essential\r\nnot 
only to identifying the types of ASs that drive\r\nAS number exhaustion,
 but also to modeling the structure\r\nand evolution of Internet

understanding the performance of\r\nnetwork applications and protocols. 
 Thus, recently there has been\r\ntremendous interest in generating 
realistic network topologies.  Such work\r\nmust begin with an 
understanding of existing network topologies, which\r\ntoday typically 
consists of a relatively small number of data sources.  In\r\nthis 
paper, we calculate an extensive set of important characteristics 
of\r\nInternet AS-level topologies extracted from the three data sources
 most\r\nfrequently used by the research community: traceroutes, BGP, 
and WHOIS.\r\nWe find that traceroute and BGP topologies are similar to 
one another but\r\ndiffer substantially from the WHOIS topology.  We 
discuss the\r\ninterplay between the properties of the data sources that
 result from\r\nspecific data collection mechanisms and the resulting 
topology views.  We\r\nfind that, among metrics widely considered, the 
joint degree\r\ndistribution appears to fundamentally 
characterize\r\nInternet AS-topologies: it narrowly defines values for 
other\r\nimportant metrics. We also introduce an evaluation criteria for
 the\r\naccuracy oftopology generators and verify previous observations 
that\r\ngenerators solely reproducing degree distributions cannot 
capture the\r\nfull spectrum of critical topological characteristics of 
any of the\r\nthree topologies. Finally, we release to the community the
 input\r\ntopology datasets, along with the scripts and output of our 
calculations.\r\nThis supplement should enable researchers to validate 
their models\r\nagainst real data and to make more informed selection of
 topology data\r\nsources for their specific needs.\r\n"

     "description": "   We introduce the area of remote physical device 
fingerprinting, or fingerprinting a physical device, as opposed to an 
operating system\r\n   or class of devices, remotely, and without the 
fingerprinted device's known cooperation. We accomplish this goal by 
exploiting small,\r\n   microscopic deviations in device hardware: clock
 skews. Our techniques do not require any modification to the 
fingerprinted devices. Our\r\n   techniques report consistent 
measurements when the measurer is thousands of miles, multiple hops, and
 tens of milliseconds away from the\r\n   fingerprinted device, and when
 the fingerprinted device is connected to the Internet from different 
locations and via different access\r\n   technologies. Further, one can 
apply our passive and semi-passive techniques when the fingerprinted 
device is behind a NAT or firewall,\r\n   and also when the device's 
system time is maintained via NTP or SNTP. One can use our techniques to
 obtain information about whether two\r\n   devices on the Internet, 
possibly shifted in time or IP addresses, are actually the same physical
 device. Example applications include:\r\n   computer forensics; 
tracking, with some probability, a physical device as it connects to the
 Internet from different public access\r\n   points; counting the number
 of devices behind a NAT even when the devices use constant or random IP
 IDs; remotely probing a block of\r\n   addresses to determine if the 
addresses correspond to virtual hosts, e.g., as part of a virtual 
honeynet; and unanonymizing anonymized\r\n   network traces.\r\n"

 generalize the problem\r\nof AS relationship inference as a

corrections to the original objective function of\r\nminimizing the 
number of invalid paths. We solve the generalized version of the problem
 using the semidefinite programming relaxation of\r\nthe MAX2SAT

published in _Proceedings\r\nof PAM 2005_.  The hardcopy version 
published by Springer includes the deprecated version, while the 
electronic\r\nproceedings include this updated version.  The updated 
paper correctly accounts for \r\nthe specific timestamp behavior, 
previously unknown to the authors,\r\nof the particular version of the 
firmware used in the Dag GE card of our\r\nexperiments.]\r\n\r\nWe 
analyze delays of traceroute probes, i.e. packets that elicit 
ICMP\r\nTimeExceeded messages, for a full range of probe sizes up to 
9000 bytes as observed\r\non unloaded high-end routers. Our ultimate 
motivation is to use traceroute\r\nRTTs for Internet mapping of router 
and PoP (ISP point-of-presence) level nodes,\r\nincluding potentially 
gleaning information on equipment models, link 
technologies,\r\ncapacities, latencies, and spatial positions. To our 
knowledge it is the first\r\nstudy to examine in a reliable testbed 
setting the detailed statistics of ICMP 
response\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nWe find that two fundamental assumptions 
about ICMP\r\nmay not hold in some cases in modern routers, namely 
that\r\nICMP delays are a linear function of packet size\r\nand that 
ICMP generation rate is equal to the capacity\r\nof the interface on 
which probes are received.\r\nThe primary causes of these violations 
appear to be\r\ninternal segmentation of packets into cells \r\nand 
limiting of ICMP\r\npacket rates and bit rates inside a router.\r\nOur 
results suggest that the linear\r\nmodel of packet delay as a function 
of packet size merits \r\nrevisiting for certain router models and time 
resolutions.\r\nOur findings also suggest possibilities of 
\r\ndeveloping new techniques for bandwidth estimation and \r\nrouter 
fingerprinting.\r\n"

     "description": "The development of veracious models of the Internet
 topology has received a lot of attention in the last few years. Many 
proposed\r\nmodels are based on topologies derived from RouteViews BGP 
table\r\ndumps (BTDs). However, BTDs do not capture all AS-links of the 
Internet topology and most importantly the number of the hidden 
AS-links\r\nis unknown, resulting in AS-graphs of questionable quality. 
As a first\r\nstep to address this problem, we introduce a new 
AS-topology discovery\r\nmethodology that results in more complete and 
accurate graphs. More\r\nover, we use data available from existing 
measurement facilities, circumventing the burden of additional 
measurement infrastructure. We deploy\r\nour methodology and construct 
an AS-topology that has at least 61.5%\r\nmore AS-links than BTD-derived
 AS-topologies we examined. Finally,\r\nwe analyze the temporal and 
topological properties of the augmented\r\ngraph and pinpoint the 
dierences from BTD-derived AS-topologies."

     "description": "We study the burstiness of TCP flows at the packet 
level. We\r\naggregate packets into entities we call \"flights\". We 
show, using a simple\r\nmodel of TCP dynamics, that delayed-acks and 
window dynamics would\r\npotentially cause flights at two different 
timescales in a TCP flow - the\r\nlower at the order of 5-10 ms 
(sub-RTT) and the higher at about 10 times\r\nthis value (order of an 
RTT seen by the flow). The model suggests that\r\nflight sizes would be 
small at the lower timescale, regardless of the network environment. The
 model also predicts that the network conditions\r\nrequired for the 
occurrence of flights at the larger timescale are either\r\nlarge 
buffers or large available bandwidths - both of which result in\r\na 
high bandwidth delay product environment. We argue that these 
two\r\nconditions indicate that the TCP flow does not operate in a 
congestion\r\ncontrol region, either because the source of traffic is 
unaware of congestion or because there is so much bandwidth that 
congestion control\r\nis not required. We verify our model by passive 
Internet measurement.\r\nUsing the trace files obtained, we collect 
statistics on flights at the two\r\ntimescales in terms of their 
frequency and size. We also find the dependence of the sizes and 
frequency of flights on the Internet environment in\r\nwhich they 
occurred. The results concur strongly with our hypothesis on\r\nthe 
origins of flights, leading us to the conclusion that flights are 
effective\r\nindicators of excess resource in the Internet.      "

,
     "datePublished": "2004.12",

     "description": "The packet pair technique aims to estimate the 
capacity of a path (bottleneck bandwidth) from the dispersion of two 
equal-sized probing packets sent back-to-back.  It has also been argued 
that the dispersion of longer packet bursts (packet trains) can estimate
 the available bandwidth of a path.  This paper examines such packet 
pair and packet train dispersion techniques in depth.  First we 
demonstrate that, in general, packet pair bandwidth measurements follow a
 multimodal distribution, and explain the causes of multiple local 
modes.  The path capacity is a local mode, often different than the 
global mode of this distribution.  We illustrate the effects of network 
load, cross traffic packet size variability, and probing packet size on 
the bandwidth distribution of packet pairs.  We then switch to the 
dispersion of long packet trains.  The mean of the packet train 
dispersion distribution corresponds to a bandwidth metric that we refer 
to as Average Dispersion Rate (ADR).  We show that the ADR is a lower 
bound of the capacity and an upper bound of the available bandwidth of a
 path.  Putting all pieces together, we present a capacity estimation 
methodology that has been implemented in a tool called _pathrate_.  We 
report on our experiences with _pathrate_ after having measured hundreds
 of Internet paths over the last three years."

     "description": "Flash worms follow a precomputed spread tree using 
prior knowledge\r\nof all systems vulnerable to the worm's exploit. In 
previous\r\nwork we suggested that a flash worm could saturate one 
million\r\nvulnerable hosts on the Internet in under 30 seconds. 
We\r\ngrossly over-estimated.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we revisit the 
problem in the context of single\r\npacket UDP worms (inspired by 
Slammer and Witty). Simulating\r\na flash version of Slammer, calibrated
 by current Internet latency\r\nmeasurements and observed worm packet 
delivery rates, we show\r\nthat a worm could saturate 95% of one million
 vulnerable hosts on\r\nthe Internet in 510 milliseconds. A similar worm
 using a TCP based\r\nservice could 95% saturate in 1.3 
seconds.\r\n\r\nThe speeds above are achieved with flat infection trees 
and packets\r\nsent at line rates. Such worms are vulnerable to recently
 proposed\r\nworm containment techniques. To avoid this,\r\nflash worms 
should slow down and use deeper, narrower trees. We\r\nexplore the 
resilience of such spread trees when the list of vulnerable\r\naddresses
 is inaccurate. Finally, we explore the implications\r\nof flash worms 
for containment defenses: such defenses must correlate\r\ninformation 
from multiple sites in order to detect the worm,\r\nbut the speed of the
 worm will defeat this correlation unless a certain\r\nfraction of 
traffic is artificially delayed in case it later proves to\r\nbe a 
worm.\r\n"

     "description": "Since the emergence of peer-to-peer (P2P) 
networking in the\r\nlate '90s, P2P applications have multiplied, 
evolved and established\r\nthemselves as the leading 'growth app' of 
Internet\r\ntraffic workload. In contrast to first-generation P2P 
networks\r\nwhich used well-defined port numbers, current 
P2P\r\napplications have the ability to disguise their existence 
through\r\nthe use of arbitrary ports. As a result, reliable estimates 
of\r\nP2P traffic require examination of packet payload, a 
methodological\r\nlandmine from legal, privacy, technical, logistic, 
and\r\nfiscal perspectives. Indeed, access to user payload is 
often\r\nrendered impossible by one of these factors, inhibiting 
trustworthy\r\nestimation of P2P traffic growth and dynamics. In\r\nthis
 paper, we develop a systematic methodology to identify\r\nP2P flows at 
the transport layer, i.e., based on connection\r\npatterns of P2P 
networks, and without relying on packet\r\npayload. We believe our 
approach is the first method for\r\ncharacterizing P2P traffic using 
only knowledge of network\r\ndynamics rather than any user payload. To 
evaluate our\r\nmethodology, we also develop a payload technique for 
P2P\r\ntraffic identification, by reverse engineering and 
analyzing\r\nthe nine most popular P2P protocols, and demonstrate 
its\r\nefficacy with the discovery of P2P protocols in our 
traces\r\nthat were previously unknown to us. Finally, our 
results\r\nindicate that P2P traffic continues to grow unabatedly, 
contrary\r\nto reports in the popular media.\r\n"

distribution of the number of packet and byte arrivals at

large number of active connections resulting in a large\r\nnumber of 
arrivals in a short period of time. Another possibility is that the tail
 is due to one or a few very fast\r\nconnections. By examining 
time-stamped packet headers from several backbone links, we find that 
the tail is\r\nneither strictly from many users nor strictly from fast 
connections. Rather, at some times and some time-scales,\r\nwe find that
 the tail (the skewness of the distribution in particular) is strongly 
influenced by the tail of the\r\ndistribution of the number of active 
connections, while at other times, the tail of the number of arrivals is
 due\r\nto the tail of the distribution of the connection 
bit-rates.\r\n"

     "description": "One of the major hurdles limiting IPv6 adoption is 
the existence\r\nof poorly managed experimental IPv6 sites that 
negatively\r\naffect the perceived quality of the IPv6 Internet. 
To\r\nassist network operators in improving IPv6 networks, we 
are\r\nexploring methods to identify wide-area IPv6 network 
problems.\r\nOur approach makes use of parallel IPv4 and 
IPv6\r\nconnectivity to dual-stacked nodes.\r\n\r\nWe identify the 
existence of an IPv6 path problem by\r\ncomparing IPv6 delay 
measurements to IPv4 delay measurements.\r\nOur test results indicate 
that the majority of\r\nIPv6 paths have delay characteristics comparable
 to those\r\nof IPv4, although a small number of paths exhibit a 
much\r\nlarger delay with IPv6. Thus, we hope to improve the 
quality\r\nof the IPv6 Internet by identifying the worst set of 
problems.\r\n\r\nOur methodology is simple. We create a list of 
systems\r\nwith IPv6 and IPv4 addresses in actual use by 
monitoring\r\nDNS messages. We then measure delay to each address in 
order\r\nto select a few systems per site based on their 
IPv6:IPv4\r\nresponse-time ratios. Finally, we run traceroute with 
Path\r\nMTU discovery to the selected systems and then visualize\r\nthe 
results for comparative path analysis. This paper\r\npresents the tools 
used to support this study, and the results\r\nof our measurements 
conducted from two locations in\r\nJapan and one in Spain.\r\n"

     "description": "Network operators need to determine the composition
 of the traffic\r\nmix on links when looking for dominant applications, 
users, or\r\nestimating traffic matrices. Cisco's NetFlow has evolved 
into a\r\nsolution that satisfies this need by reporting flow records 
that\r\nsummarize a sample of the traffic traversing the link. But 
sampled\r\nNetFlow has shortcomings that hinder the collection and 
analysis\r\nof traffic data.  First, during flooding attacks router 
memory and\r\nnetwork bandwidth consumed by flow records can increase 
beyond what\r\nis available; second, selecting the right static sampling
 rate is\r\ndifficult because no single rate gives the right tradeoff of
 memory\r\nuse versus accuracy for all traffic mixes; third, the 
heuristics\r\nrouters use to decide when a flow is reported are a poor 
match to\r\nmost applications that work with time bins; finally, it is 
impossible\r\nto estimate without bias the number of active flows for 
aggregates\r\nwith non-TCP traffic.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we propose 
Adaptive NetFlow, deployable through an\r\nupdate to router software, 
which addresses many shortcomings of\r\nNetFlow by dynamically adapting 
the sampling rate to achieve\r\nrobustness without sacrificing accuracy.
 To enable counting of\r\nnon-TCP flows, we propose an optional Flow 
Counting Extension that\r\nrequires augmenting existing hardware at 
routers. Both our proposed\r\nsolutions readily provide descriptions of 
the traffic of progressively\r\nsmaller sizes. Transmitting these at 
progressively higher levels\r\nof reliability allows graceful 
degradation of the accuracy of traffic\r\nreports in response to network
 congestion on the reporting path."

     "description": "Previous research has shown that most of the DNS 
queries\r\nreaching the root of the hierarchy are bogus . This 
behavior\r\nderives from two constraints on the system: (1) 
queries\r\nthat cannot be satisfied locally percolate up to the root 
of\r\nthe DNS; (2) some caching nameservers are behind packet\r\nfilters
 or firewalls that allow outgoing queries but block incoming\r\nreplies.
 These resolvers assume the network failure is\r\ntemporary and 
retransmit their queries, often aggressively.\r\n\r\nDNS pollution may 
not be causing any perceivable performance problems. The root servers 
seem well equipped to\r\nhandle the load. Since DNS messages are small, 
the pollution\r\ndoes not contribute significantly to the total 
traffic\r\ngenerated by most organizations. Nonetheless, this 
paper\r\nprovides a few reasons why network operators should take\r\nthe
 time to investigate and fix these problems."

     "description": "On Friday, 19 March 2004, at approximately 8:45 
p.m. Pacific Standard Time\r\n(PST), an Internet worm began to spread, 
targeting a buffer overflow\r\nvulnerability in several Internet 
Security Systems (ISS) products,\r\nincluding its RealSecure 
Network,\r\n\r\nRealSecure Server Sensor, RealSecure Desktop, and 
BlackICE. The worm took\r\nadvantage of a security flaw in these 
firewall applications that eEye\r\nDigital Security discovered earlier 
in March. Once the Witty worm--so\r\ncalled because its payload 
contained the phrase, \"(^.^) insert witty\r\nmessage here 
(^,^)\"--infects a computer, it deletes a randomly chosen\r\nsection of 
the hard drive, which, over time, renders the machine 
unusable.\r\n\r\nWhile the Witty worm is only the latest in a string of 
self-propagating\r\nremote exploits, it distinguishes itself through 
several interesting\r\nfeatures:\r\n\r\n* It was the first widely 
propagated Internet worm to carry a\r\ndestructive payload.\r\n* It 
started in an organized manner with an order of magnitude 
more\r\nground-zero hosts than any previous worm.\r\n* It represents the
 shortest known interval between vulnerability\r\ndisclosure and worm 
release--it began spreading the day after the ISS\r\nvulnerability was 
publicized.\r\n* It spread through a host population in which every 
compromised host\r\nwas proactive in securing its computers and 
networks.\r\n* It spread through a population almost an order of 
magnitude smaller\r\nthan that of previous worms, demonstrating worms' 
viability as an automated\r\nmechanism to rapidly compromise machines on
 the Internet, even in niches\r\nwithout a software monopoly.\r\n\r\nIn 
this article, we share a global view of the worm's spread, 
with\r\nparticular attention to these worrisome features."

impossible\r\nto estimate without bias the number of active flows for 
aggregates\r\nwith non-TCP traffic.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we propose 
Adaptive NetFlow, deployable through an\r\nupdate to router software, 
which addresses many shortcomings of\r\nNetFlow by dynamically adapting 
the sampling rate to achieve\r\nrobustness without sacrificing accuracy.
 To enable counting of\r\nnon-TCP flows, we propose an optional Flow 
Counting Extension that\r\nrequires augmenting existing hardware at 
routers. Both our proposed\r\nsolutions readily provide descriptions of 
the traffic of progressively\r\nsmaller sizes. Transmitting these at 
progressively higher levels\r\nof reliability allows graceful 
degradation of the accuracy of traffic\r\nreports in response to network
 congestion on the reporting path.\r\n\r\nNote: This technical report 
contains additional proofs of lemmas\r\nand more detailed measurement 
results."

are\r\ncritical components of many network attacks. Such 
scanning\r\nallows attackers to spread a self-propagating worm or 
collect\r\ndetailed information about end-hosts in preparation for 
attacks.\r\nThis paper investigates an algorithm to detect 
TCP-SYN\r\nscanning. Special care is taken to detect even stealthy 
scanners.\r\nAttackers are detected by tracking the number of 
half-open\r\nconnections generated by each source. However, a source 
is\r\nonly tracked until it is clear that it is not currently 
scanning.\r\nThe computational load of this method is analyzed and it 
is\r\nfound that the method is not computationally intensive and\r\nis 
suitable for online detection of scanning even on backbone\r\nlinks. 
Specifically, on a backbone link investigated it was found\r\nthat the 
total number of sources that needs to be tracked at\r\nany one time is 
at most a few thousand.\r\n"

in the face\r\nof high disparity affects all aspects of network 
operation: planning, routing, \r\nengineering, security, and accounting.
 We analyze diversity/disparity\r\nfrom the perspective of selecting a 
boundary between mice and elephants\r\nin IP traffic aggregated by 
route, e.g., destination AS. Our goal is to find\r\na concise quantifier
 of size disparity for IP addresses, prefixes, policy\r\natoms and ASes,
 similar to the oft-quoted 80/20 split (e.g., 80% of volume \r\nin 20% 
of sources). We define crossover as the fraction c of total\r\nvolume 
contributed by a complementary fraction 1 - c of large 
objects.\r\nStudying sources and sinks at two Tier 1 backbones and one 
university,\r\nwe find that splits of 90/10 and 95/5 are common for IP 
traffic. We\r\ncompare the crossover diversity to common analytic models
 for size distributions \r\nsuch as Pareto/Zipf. We find that AS traffic
 volumes (by byte)\r\nare top-heavy and can only be approximated by 
Pareto with alpha = 0.5,\r\nand that empirical distributions are often 
close to Weibull with shape\r\nparameter 0.2-0.3. We also find that less
 than 20 ASes send or receive\r\n50% of all traffic in both backbones' 
samples, a disparity that can simplify \r\ntraffic engineering. Our

     "datePublished": "2004.3",
     "date": "200403",
     "description": "The Thorup-Zwick (TZ) compact routing scheme is the
 first generic stretch-3 routing scheme delivering a nearly optimal 
per-node memory upper bound. Using both direct analysis and simulation, 
we derive the stretch distribution of this routing scheme on 
Internet-like inter-domain topologies. By investigating the TZ scheme on
 random graphs with power-law node degree distributions, 
Pk\u0026cong;k-\u0026#947;, we find that the average TZ stretch is quite
 low and virtually independent of \u0026#947;. In particular, for the 
Internet inter-domain graph with \u0026#947;\u0026cong;2.1, the average 
TZ stretch is around 1.1, with up to 70% of all pairwise paths being 
stretch-1 (shortest possible). As the network grows, the average stretch
 slowly decreases. We find routing table sizes to be very small (around 
50 records for 104-node networks), well below their theoretical upper 
bounds. Furthermore, we find that both the average shortest path length 
(i.e. distance) d\u0026sim; and width of the distance distribution 
\u0026#963; observed in the real Internet inter-AS graph have values 
that are very close to the minimums of the average stretch in the 
d\u0026sim; and \u0026#963; -directions. This leads us to the discovery 
of a unique critical point of the average TZ stretch as a function of 
d\u0026sim; and \u0026#963;. The Internet's distance distribution is 
located in a close neighborhood of this point. This is remarkable given 
the fact that the Internet inter-domain topology has evolved without any
 direct attention paid to properties of the stretch distribution. It 
suggests the average stretch function may be an indirect indicator of 
the optimization criteria influencing the Internet's inter-domain 
topology evolution.\r\n"

     "description": "Since the identification of long-range dependence 
in network traffic ten years ago, its consistent appearance across 
numerous measurement studies has largely discredited Poissonbased 
models. However, since that original data set was collected, both link 
speeds and the number of Internet-connected hosts have increased by more
 than three orders of magnitude. Thus, we now revisit the Poisson 
assumption, by studying a combination of historical traces and new 
measurements obtained from a major backbone link belonging to a Tier 1 
ISP. We show that unlike the older data sets, current network traffic 
can be well represented by the Poisson model for sub-second time scales.
 At multi-second scales, we find a distinctive piecewise-linear 
non-stationarity, together with evidence of long-range dependence. 
Combining our observations across both time scales leads to a 
time-dependent Poisson characterization of network traffic that, when 
viewed across very long time scales, exhibits the observed long-range 
dependence. This traffic characterization reconciliates the seemingly 
contradicting observations of Poisson and long-memory traffic 
characteristics. It also seems to be in general agreement with recent 
theoretical models for large-scale traffic aggregation.\r\n"

     "description": "It is well known that the performance of a TCP flow
 is affected by its round-trip time (RTT), i.e., the elapsed time 
between the instant a packet is released by the source to the instant 
the corresponding ack is received by the source. The distribution of 
RTTs can dramatically affect not only the data rates realized by 
individual flows sharing a link but also the utilization of Internet 
links. In this paper we present a comprehensive study of the RTT 
distribution for TCP traffic in the Internet."

     "description": "Previously Broido and Claffy analysed the global 
Internet interdomain routing system based on BGP policy atoms: 
equivalence classes of prefixes based on common AS path as observed from
 a number of topological locations [6] [7]. In this report we define a 
variant of policy atoms, called declared atoms. Declared atoms 
constitute an aggregation mechanism complementary to CIDR aggregation. 
We describe a new routing architecture, called atomised routing, based 
on BGP and declared atoms. Atomised routing aims for a reduction in the 
number of routed objects in the default-free zone of the Internet 
(around 20k declared atoms covering around 113k prefixes), and an 
improved convergence behaviour of the interdomain routing system. We 
also demonstrate the viability of incremental deployment of atomised 
routing.\r\n"

     "description": "The Slammer worm spread so quickly that human 
response was ineffective. In January 2003, it packed a benign payload, 
but its disruptive capacity was surprising. Why was it so effective and 
what new challenges does this new breed of worm pose? \r\n\r\nSlammer 
(sometimes called Sapphire) was the fastest computer worm in history. As
 it began spreading throughout the Internet, the worm infected more than
 90 percent of vulnerable hosts within 10 minutes, causing significant 
disruption to financial, transportation, and government institutions and
 precluding any human-based response. In this article, we describe how 
it achieved its rapid growth, dissect portions of the worm to study some
 of its flaws, and look at our defensive effectiveness against it and 
its successors.\r\n\r\nSlammer began to infect hosts slightly before 
05:30 UTC on Saturday, 25 January 2003, by exploiting a buffer-overflow 
vulnerability in computers on the Internet running Microsoft's SQL 
Server or Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine (MSDE) 2000. David 
Litchfield of Next Generation Security Software discovered this 
underlying indexing service weakness in July 2002; Microsoft released a 
patch for the vulnerability before the vulnerability was publicly 
disclosed (www.microsoft.com/security/slammer.asp). Exploiting this 
vulnerability, the worm infected at least 75,000 hosts, perhaps 
considerably more, and caused network outages and unforeseen 
consequences such as canceled airline flights, interference with 
elections, and ATM failures.\r\n"

throughput  often characterize the amount of data that the network can 
transfer per unit of time. Bandwidth estimation is of interest to users 
wishing to optimize end-to-end transport performance, overlay network 
routing, and peer-to-peer file distribution. Techniques for accurate 
bandwidth estimation are also important for traffic engineering and 
capacity planning support. Existing bandwidth estimation tools measure 
one or more of three related metrics: capacity, available bandwidth, and
 bulk transfer capacity (BTC). Currently available bandwidth estimation 
tools employ a variety of strategies to measure these metrics. In this 
survey we review the recent bandwidth estimation literature focusing on 
underlying techniques and methodologies as well as open source bandwidth
 measurement tools.\n"

     "description": "Traceroute IP paths are often used in studies of 
Internet topology and\r\nrouting.  Though producing one of the best 
available router-level maps\r\nof forward paths, traceroute is 
susceptible to several types of\r\ninaccuracies.  However, no one to 
date has quantified the magnitude of\r\nthese inaccuracies in real-world
 traceroute paths.  We make an initial\r\nattempt by reporting on the 
observed frequency of one type of\r\ninaccuracy---third-party addresses.
  A third-party address is the\r\naddress of a router interface that 
does not lie in the actual path\r\ntaken by packets.  Based on an 
examination of thousands of\r\ntraceroute paths from six locations 
worldwide and the application of\r\nseveral metrics, we find that the 
situations in which third-party\r\naddresses can occur to be relatively 
uncommon.  They mostly occur\r\nwithin a few hops of the destination 
(that is, at the destination\r\nedge of the network), with multihoming 
being their most likely cause.\r\nOur conclusion is that third-party 
addresses cannot be a significant\r\nsource of AS map distortions.\r\n"

     "description": "The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical 
component\nof the modern Internet. It provides a critical link 
between\nhuman users and Internet routing infrastructure by 
mapping\nhost names to IP addresses. The DNS is a hierarchy\nof 
distributed system of servers anchored at 13 DNS root\nservers.\n\nIn 
this paper we examine the macroscopic connectivity\nbetween the DNS root
 servers and the worldwide population\nof their clients. We study the 
impact of the geographical\nlocations of root servers on the latency of 
server-client\nconnections. We also propose a methodology to estimate 
the\neffects of root servers' relocation.\n\nWe found that all root 
servers can be clustered in four\ngroups that closely correlate with 
their geographical positions.\nServers in the same group are nearly 
indistinguishable\nfor their clients in terms of latency and can replace
 one\nanother in providing DNS services to the clients. M-root, 
the\nonly root server in Asia, is in a group of its own and, 
therefore,\nis the most crucial for its clients in terms of the 
latency\nincrease in case of its unavailability. Clients in Europe 
appear\nto be relatively underprovisioned and may merit an 
additional\nroot server. Clients in North America appear 
overprovisioned.\nOne of the US servers may be a suitable candidate\nfor
 relocation to a different region of the world."

Self-Propagating Code"
,
     "datePublished": "2003.4",
     "date": "200304",
     "description": "It has been clear since 1988 that 
self-propagating\r\ncode can quickly spread across a network by 
exploiting homoge-neous\r\nsecurity vulnerabilities. However, the last 
few years have\r\nseen a dramatic increase in the frequency and 
virulence of such\r\n\"worm\" outbreaks. For example, the Code-Red worm 
epidemics\r\nof 2001 infected hundreds of thousands of Internet hosts in
 a very\r\nshort period - incurring enormous operational expense to 
track\r\ndown, contain, and repair each infected machine. In 
response\r\nto this threat, there is considerable effort focused on 
developing\r\ntechnical means for detecting and containing worm 
infections\r\nbefore they can cause such damage.\r\n\r\nThis paper does 
not propose a particular technology to address\r\nthis problem, but 
instead focuses on a more basic question: How\r\nwell will any such 
approach contain a worm epidemic on the\r\nInternet? We describe the 
design space of worm containment\r\nsystems using three key parameters- 
reaction time, contain-ment\r\nstrategy and deployment scenario. Using a
 combination of\r\nanalytic modeling and simulation, we describe how 
each of these\r\ndesign factors impacts the dynamics of a worm epidemic 
and,\r\nconversely, the minimum engineering requirements necessary 
to\r\ncontain the spread of a given worm. While our analysis 
cannot\r\nprovide definitive guidance for engineering defenses against 
all\r\nfuture threats, we demonstrate the lower bounds that any 
such\r\nsystem must exceed to be useful today. Unfortunately, our 
results\r\nsuggest that there are significant technological and 
administrative\r\ngaps to be bridged before an effective defense can be 
provided\r\nin today's Internet.\r\n"

publically available long-term Internet\r\ntraffic workload data, namely
 the NLANR PMA archive of packet header\r\ntraces. Trace samples were 
collected at a number of academic, research,\r\nand commercial sites 
during years 1998-2003. We consider four metrics of\r\ntraffic: bytes, 
packets, flows, and number of source-destination pairs.\r\nWe also 
analyze the composition of traffic by protocol.\r\n\r\n"

including: (i) a preponderance of single-packet flows; (ii) a highly

,
     "datePublished": "2003.1",
     "date": "200301",
     "description": "The Sapphire Worm was the fastest computer worm in 
history.  As it\r\nbegan spreading throughout the Internet, it doubled 
in size every 8.5\r\nseconds.  It infected more than 90 percent of 
vulnerable hosts within\r\n10 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe worm (also called 
Slammer) began to infect hosts slightly\r\nbefore 05:30 UTC on Saturday,
 January 25.  Sapphire exploited a\r\nbuffer overflow vulnerability in 
computers on the Internet running\r\nMicrosoft's SQL Server or MSDE 2000
 (Microsoft SQL Server Desktop\r\nEngine).  This weakness in an 
underlying indexing service was\r\ndiscovered in July 2002; Microsoft 
released a patch for the\r\nvulnerability before it was announced. The 
worm\r\ninfected at least 75,000 hosts, perhaps considerably more, and 
caused\r\nnetwork outages and such unforeseen consequences as canceled 
airline\r\nflights, interference with elections, and ATM failures.  
Several\r\ndisassembled versions of the source code of the worm 
are\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nPropagation speed was Sapphire's novel feature:
 in the first minute, the infected population doubled in size every 8.5 
(\u0026plusmn;1) seconds. The worm achieved its full scanning rate (over
 55 million scans per second) after approximately three minutes, after 
which the rate of growth slowed down somewhat because significant 
portions of the network did not have enough bandwidth to allow it to 
operate unhindered. Most vulnerable machines were infected within 
10-minutes of the worm's release. Although worms with this rapid 
propagation had been predicted on theoretical grounds, the spread of 
Sapphire provides the first real incident demonstrating the capabilities
 of a high-speed worm. By comparison, it was two orders magnitude faster
 than the Code Red worm, which infected over 359,000 hosts on July 19th,
 2001. In comparison, the Code Red worm population had a leisurely 
doubling time of about 37 minutes. \r\n\r\nWhile Sapphire did not 
contain a malicious payload, it caused considerable harm simply by 
overloading networks and taking database servers out of operation. Many 
individual sites lost connectivity as their access bandwidth was 
saturated by local copies of the worm and there were several reports of 
Internet backbone disruption (although most backbone providers appear to
 have remained stable throughout the epidemic). It is important to 
realize that if the worm had carried a malicious payload, had attacked a
 more widespread vulnerability, or had targeted a more popular service, 
the effects would likely have been far more severe. \r\n\r\nThis 
document is a preliminary analysis of the Sapphire worm, principally 
focused on determining the speed and scope of its spread and the 
mechanisms that were used to achieve this result. \r\n"

     "description": "Abstract -- Fragmented IP traffic is a poorly 
understood\r\ncomponent of the overall mix of traffic on the 
Internet.\r\nMany assertions about the nature and extent of 
fragmented\r\ntraffic are anecdotal rather than empirical. In this 
paper\r\nwe examine the causes and attributes of measured 
fragment\r\ntraffic, in particular, the effects of NFS, streaming 
media,\r\nnetworked video games, tunneled traffic, and the 
prevalence\r\nof packet fragmentation due to improperly configured 
machines.\r\n\r\nTo understand the prevalence, causes, and effects of 
fragmented\r\nIP traffic, we have collected and analyzed 
seven\r\nmulti-day traces from four sources. These sources include\r\na 
university commodity access link, two highly aggregated\r\ncommercial 
exchange points, and a local NAP. Although\r\nthere is no practical 
method of ascertaining whether any\r\ndata provide a representative 
sample of all Internet traffic,\r\nwe include data sources that cover 
several different types\r\nof WANs with traffic from commercial 
entities, educational\r\nand research institutions, and large government
 facilities.\r\n\r\nThe dominant causes of fragmentation are streaming 
media\r\nand tunneled traffic. Although rumored to be the 
main\r\nimpetus for IP packet fragmentation, NFS is not among the\r\ntop
 ten causes.\r\n"

     "datePublished": "2002.11",

     "description": "On July 19, 2001, more than 359,000 
computers\r\nconnected to the Internet were infected with the 
Code-Red\r\n(CRv2) worm in less than 14 hours. The cost of 
this\r\nepidemic, including subsequent strains of Code-Red, is 
estimated\r\nto be in excess of $2.6 billion. Despite the 
global\r\ndamage caused by this attack, there have been few 
serious\r\nattempts to characterize the spread of the worm, 
partly\r\ndue to the challenge of collecting global information 
about\r\nworms. Using a technique that enables global detection 
of\r\nworm spread, we collected and analyzed data over a period\r\nof 45
 days beginning July 2nd, 2001 to determine the characteristics\r\nof 
the spread of Code-Red throughout the Internet.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we
 describe the methodology we use to trace\r\nthe spread of Code-Red, and
 then describe the results of our\r\ntrace analyses. We first detail the
 spread of the Code-Red\r\nand CodeRedII worms in terms of infection and
 deactivation\r\nrates. Even without being optimized for spread of 
infection,\r\nCode-Red infection rates peaked at over 2,000 hosts 
per\r\nminute. We then examine the properties of the infected 
host\r\npopulation, including geographic location, weekly and 
diurnal\r\ntime effects, top-level domains, and ISPs. We 
demonstrate\r\nthat the worm was an international event, infection 
activity\r\nexhibited time-of-day effects, and found that, 
although\r\nmost attention focused on large corporations, the 
Code-Red\r\nworm primarily preyed upon home and small business 
users.\r\nWe also qualified the effects of DHCP on measurements 
of\r\ninfected hosts and determined that IP addresses are not 
an\r\naccurate measure of the spread of a worm on timescales\r\nlonger 
than 24 hours. Finally, the experience of the Code-Red\r\nworm 
demonstrates that wide-spread vulnerabilities in\r\nInternet hosts can 
be exploited quickly and dramatically,\r\nand that techniques other than
 host patching are required\r\nto mitigate Internet worms.\r\n"

     "description": "\nAbstract -- We present the concept of network 
traffic streams, and the\nways they aggregate into flows through 
Internet links. We describe a\nmethod of measuring the size and lifetime
 of Internet streams, and use this\nmethod to characterise traffic 
distributions at two different sites.\nWe find that although most 
streams (about 45% of them) are dragonflies,\nlasting less than 2 
seconds, a significant number of streams have lifetimes\nof hours to 
days, and can carry a high proportion (50% to 60%) of the total\nbytes 
on a given link. We define tortoises as streams that last longer 
than\n15 minutes. We point out that streams can be classified not only 
by lifetime\n(dragonflies and tortoises) but also by size (mice and 
elephants), and note\nthat stream size and lifetime are independent 
dimensions.\nWe submit that Service Providers (ISPs) need to be aware of
 the distribution\nof Internet stream sizes, and the impact of the 
difference in behaviour\nbetween short and long streams. In particular 
any forwarding cache mechanisms\nin Internet routers must be able to 
cope with a high volume of short\nstreams. In addition ISPs should 
realise that Long-Running (LR) streams\ncan contribute a significant 
fraction of their packet and byte volumes --\nsomething they may not 
have allowed for when using traditional 'flat rate\nuser bandwidth 
consumption' approaches to provisioning and engineering.\n"

Storage "
,
     "datePublished": "2002.5",

     "description": "In the past few years, peer-to-peer networks have 
become an extremely popular mechanism\r\nfor large-scale content 
sharing. Unlike traditional client-server applications,\r\nwhich 
centralize the management of data in a few highly reliable servers, 
peer-to-peer\r\nsystems distribute the burden of data storage, 
computation, communications and administration\r\namong thousands of 
individual client workstations. While the popularity\r\nof this 
approach, exemplified by systems such as Gnutella, was driven by 
the\r\npopularity of unrestricted music distribution, newer work has 
expanded the potential\r\napplication base to generalized distributed 
file systems, persistent anonymous\r\npublishing, as well as support for
 high-quality video distribution. The widespread\r\nattraction of the 
peer-to-peer model arises primarily from its potential for 
both\r\nlow-cost scalability and enhanced availability. Ideally a 
peer-to-peer system could ef-\r\nficiently multiplex the resources and 
connectivity of its workstations across all of its\r\nusers while at the
 same time protecting its users from transient or persistent failures 
in\r\na subset of its components.\r\n\r\nHowever, these goals are not 
trivially engineered. First-generation peer-to-peer\r\nsystems, such as 
Gnutella, scaled poorly due to the overhead in locating content 
within\r\nthe network. Consequently, developing efficient lookup 
algorithms has consumed most\r\nof the recent academic work in this 
area. The challenges in providing high\r\navailability to such systems 
is more poorly understood and only now being studied.\r\nIn particular, 
unlike traditional distributed systems, the individual components of 
a\r\npeer-to-peer system experience an order of magnitude worse 
availability -- individually\r\nadministered workstations may be turned 
on and off, join and leave the system, have 
intermittent\r\nconnectivity, and are constructed from low-cost 
low-reliability components.\r\nOne recent study of a popular 
peer-to-peer file sharing system found that the majority\r\nof peers had
 application-level availability rates of under 20 percent.\r\n\r\nAs a 
result, all peer-to-peer systems must employ some form of replication to
 provide\r\nacceptable service to their users. In systems such as 
Gnutella, this replication\r\noccurs implicitly as each file downloaded 
by a user is implicitly replicated at the user's\r\nworkstation. 
However, since these systems do not explicitly manage replication 
or\r\nmask failures, the availability of an object is fundamentally 
linked to its popularity and\r\nusers have to repeatedly access 
different replicas until they find one on an available\r\nhost. 
Next-generation peer-to-peer storage systems, such as the Cooperative 
File System\r\n(CFS), recognize the need to mask failures from the user 
and implement a basic\r\nreplication strategy that is independent of the
 user workload.\r\n\r\nWhile most peer-to-peer systems employ some form 
of data redundancy to cope\r\nwith failure, these solutions are not 
well-matched to the underlying host failure distribution\r\nor the level
 of availability desired by users. Consequently, it remains 
unclear\r\nwhat availability guarantees can be made using existing 
systems, or conversely how to\r\nbest achieve a desired level of 
availability using the mechanisms available.\r\n\r\nIn our work we are 
exploring replication strategy design trade-offs along 
several\r\ninterdependent axes: Replication granularity, replica 
placement, and application characteristics,\r\neach of which we address 
in subsequent sections. The closest analog to our\r\nwork is that of 
Weatherspoon and Kubiatowicz who compare the availability provided\r\nby
 erasure coding and whole file replication under particular failure 
assumptions.\r\nThe most critical differences between this work and our 
own revolve around the failure\r\nmodel. In particular,Weatherspoon and 
Kubiatowicz focus on disk failure as the dominant\r\nfactor in data 
availability and consequently miss the distinction between short 
and\r\nlong time scales that is critical to deployed peer-to-peer 
systems. Consequently, their\r\nmodel is likely to overestimate true 
file availability in this environment.\r\n"

     "description": "We analyze the evolution of the global Internet 
interdomain routing system on AS, prefix and IP address level 
granularities,\nusing snapshots of RouteViews BGP tables from 1997 to 
2001. We introduce the notion of semiglobally routed\nprefixes, those 
present in the majority of backbone tables, and classify them into 
standalone -- those which have no subsets,\nno supersets; root -- have 
subsets, but no supersets; and subset, or more specific, which are 
subsets of other blocks.\n\nUsing these distinctions we find that from 
1999 to 2001 many measures of routing system complexity 
demonstrated\nstability in the form of slow growth, dynamic equilibrium,
 and occasional contraction.\n\nWe find that many net change measures 
reflect contributions of opposite sign, and that true measure of 
variation, or\nchurn, is the sum of their absolute magnitudes rather 
than the difference. Appearance and disappearance of prefixes, ASes\nand
 RouteViews peers, as well as status changes (an AS changing from 
transit to non-transit, or a prefix shifting from a\nstandalone prefix 
to a root prefix) are instances of routing system churn. One advantage 
of using our notion of semiglobal\nprefixes is that they exhibit less 
churn than global prefixes (those prefixes common to all backbone 
tables) and as such\nallow for derivation of more robust macroscopic 
statistics about the routing system.\n\nWe study route prefix 
instability at a medium time granularity for late 2001 using 2-hour 
snapshots of BGP tables,\nand find that half of all prefix 
reannouncements (flips) are contributed by 1% of all ASes, with 
government networks,\ntelecoms in developing countries and major 
backbone ISPs at the top of the list of instability contributors. Small 
ASes\n(those who originate only a few prefixes into the global routing 
system) do not contribute more than their fair share of\neither route 
entries or churn to the global routing system. We conclude that during 
1999-2001 many Internet metrics were\nstable, and that the routing 
system's growth and instability are mostly caused by large and 
medium-sized ISPs.\n"

 make-up. Our goal is to build an\r\nanalytical framework for evaluating
 the optimality of root server placement and its impact on 
the\r\nefficiency of the DNS service. The skitter tool and the 
methodology we propose can also be used\r\nfor monitoring the end-to-end

     "description": "The Internet Domain Name System (DNS) is an 
essential part of the Internet\r\ninfrastructure.  Each web site or 
email lookup involves traversing a\r\ntree-structure distributed 
database to complete the mapping from a hostname to\r\nan IP address.  
The root and top level domain (TLD) nameservers form the\r\nhighest 
level of authority over the Internet naming hierarchy, and are 
thus\r\npotentially involved in reaching any and every URL or email 
address we seek.\r\nWe use passive measurements to analyze performance 
of these critical\r\nnameservers from a client network's 
viewpoint.\r\n\r\nWe use NeTraMet meters on a university campus to take 
passive measurements of\r\nDNS response time, request loss rate and 
request load to the root and gTLD\r\n(generic top level domain, e.g., 
.com, .net, .org) servers.\r\n\r\nFrom these measurements we produce 
strip charts that are useful for day-to-day\r\nmonitoring of one's 
Internet connectivity, since they reveal changes in\r\nnetwork behaviour
 on paths between one's local network and the global servers\r\nwithout 
the need to actively inject traffic into the network.  We 
are\r\ndeveloping a monitoring tool to produce such plots in near real 
time.\r\n"

 nature and extent of fragmented traffic are\r\nanecdotal rather than 
empirical. In this paper we examine\r\nthe causes and attributes of 
measured fragment traffic and\r\ncontrast those results with commonly

networked video\r\ngames, and tunneled traffic are quantified, and we 
estimate\r\nthe prevalence of packet fragmentation due to 
improperly\r\nconfigured machines.\r\nTo understand the prevalence, 
causes, and effects of fragmented\r\nIP traffic, we have collected and 
analyzed seven\r\nmulti-day traces from three sources. These sources 
include a\r\nuniversity commodity access link, a highly aggregated 
commercial\r\nexchange point, and a local NAP. Although there\r\nis no 
practical method of ascertaining whether any data\r\nprovide a 
representative sample of all Internet traffic, we\r\ndo include data

of\r\nseveral IP-level graphs derived from a collection of 
220M\r\nskitter traceroutes. We find that a graph consisting of 
IP\r\nnodes and links contains 90.5% of its 629K nodes in 
the\r\n_acyclic subgraph_. In particular, 55% of the IP nodes are 
in\r\ntrees. Full bidirectional connectivity is observed for a 
_giant\r\ncomponent_ containing 8.3% of IP nodes.\r\n\r\nWe analyze the 
same structures (trees, acyclic part, core,\r\ngiant component) for 
other combinatorial models of Internet\r\n(IP-level) topology, including
 arc graphs and place-holder\r\ngraphs. We also show that Weibull

     "description": "In this paper we introduce a framework for 
analyzing\nBGP connectivity, and evaluate a number of new 
complexity\nmeasures for a union of core backbone BGP tables. Sensitive 
to engineering resource limitations of router memory\nand CPU cycles, we
 focus on techniques to estimate redundancy of the merged tables, in 
particular how many entries\nare essential for complete and correct 
routing.\n\nWe introduced the notion of policy atoms as part\nof a 
calculus in routing table analysis. We found that the\nnumber of atoms 
and individual counts of atoms with a given\nnumber of prefixes properly
 scale with the Internet's growth\nand with filtering of prefixes by 
length. We show that the\nuse of atoms can potentially reduce the number
 of route\nannouncements by a factor of two, with all routing 
policies\nbeing preserved. Atoms thus represent Internet properties\nin 
an accurate way, yet with much smaller complexity.\n\nSeveral of our 
analysis results suggest that commonly\nheld Internet engineering 
beliefs require re-consideration.\nWe find that more specific routes had
 a relatively constant\nshare of routes in backbone tables across 
2000/2001. On\nthe other hand, the churn of more specific routes was 
much\nlarger than that of top prefixes. We also find that deaggregation 
of existing announcements is a second major source\n(beyond announcement
 of recently allocated address space)\nof new top (least specific) 
prefixes in global BGP tables.\nWe also provide examples of 
misconguration and noise in\nBGP data, including multi-origin prefixes, 
AS paths with\napparent routing loops (some of them due to 
typographical\nerrors, other actual loops undetected by local BGP 
speakers), inadvertent transit through customer ASes.\n"

     "description": "Passive data collection tools have traditionally 
been designed for\r\nspecific tasks such as accounting (NeTraMet) or 
packet capture (tcpdump).\r\n[The CoralReef 
suite](https://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/coralreef/) 
was\r\ndesigned to provide a uniform interface to passive data for a 
wide range of\r\napplications: from raw capture to real-time report 
generation. CoralReef\r\nprovides convenient set of passive data tools 
for a diverse audience, from\r\nnetwork administrators to 
researchers.\r\n\r\nThe CoralReef architecture is based on a toolbox 
paradigm. The base\r\nprogramming interface is implemented in a C 
library named libcoral. In\r\norder to allow users to write a single 
program to access many data sources,\r\nlibcoral provides a consistent 
API for capture cards from multiple\r\nproviders on ATM, POS, and 
10-100-1000 ethernet capture cards from multiple\r\nvendors, as well as 
pcap interfaces. In addition, libcoral provides a\r\nconsistent 
interface to many packet capture file formats including: all\r\ncoral 
formats (NLANR formats included), pcap, DAG ATM, and DAG POS. 
This\r\nAPI satisfies an important design goal of providing multiple 
ways to\r\napproach the same problem. The libcoral API can operate on 
ATM cells,\r\nblocks of cells, or network packets, one at a time or via 
callbacks; the\r\napplication developer can use whichever is most 
convenient. NeTraMet and\r\nVern Paxson's Bro are two applications that 
have been adapted to use the\r\nCoral API. To facilitate rapid 
prototyping and development, another design\r\ngoal is to provide the 
same interface in C/C\u002b\u002b and Perl. Because the Perl\r\nmodule 
CRL.pm directly calls the C routines, Perl scripts using 
CRL.pm\r\nperform well enough for many data analysis applications. 
Additional\r\nlibraries and modules have been provided to perform more 
complex tasks.\r\nThere are libraries and Perl modules for doing AS 
lookups from BGP routing\r\ntables and others for determining geographic
 locations via NetGeo.\r\nCoralReef includes modules for the storage and
 manipulation of frequently\r\ncollected data including: source and 
destination hosts, IP protocols,\r\nports, and amounts of traffic in 
bytes, packets and flows. These modules\r\nprovide methods to 
automatically aggregate data into other table types and\r\nallow for 
efficiently selecting those entries that generate the most\r\ntraffic. 
For example, it is possible to convert an AS table of 
byte/packet\r\ncounts into a country table with a single method call. 
Higher level\r\napplications are written using these building blocks, so
 that for example\r\ncreating an IP or AS matrix is accomplished with 
just a small Perl program,\r\nwhile larger programs (such as the 
realtime report generator t2_report) are\r\nmore complex arrangements of
 the same building blocks."

paper\nwe examine the causes and attributes of measured

packet fragmentation due to improperly configured machines.\n\nTo 
understand the prevalence, causes, and effects of fragmented\nIP 
traffic, we have collected and analyzed seven\nmulti-day traces from 
four sources. These sources include\na university commodity access link,
 two highly aggregated\ncommercial exchange points, and a local NAP. 
Although\nthere is no practical method of ascertaining whether any\ndata
 provide a representative sample of all Internet traffic,\nwe include 
data sources that cover several different types\nof WANs with traffic 
from commercial entities, educational\nand research institutions, and 
large government facilities.\n\nThe dominant causes of fragmentation are
 streaming media\nand tunneled traffic. Although rumored to be the 
main\nimpetus for IP packet fragmentation, NFS is not among the\ntop ten
 causes.\n"

 a path\r\n(bottleneck bandwidth) from the dispersion (spacing) 
experienced by\r\ntwo back-to-back packets. We demonstrate that the 
dispersion of\r\npacket pairs in loaded paths follows a multimodal 
distribution, and\r\ndis-cuss the queueing effects that cause the 
multiple modes. We\r\nshow that the path capacity is often not the 
global mode, and so it\r\ncannot be estimated using standard statistical
 procedures. The\r\neffect of the size of the probing packets is also 
investigated,\r\nshowing that the conventional wisdom of using maximum 
sized packet\r\npairs is not optimal. We then study the dispersion of 
long packet\r\ntrains. Increasing the length of the packet train reduces
 the\r\nmeasurement variance, but the estimates converge to a 
value,\r\nreferred to as Asymptotic Dispersion Rate (ADR), that is lower
 than\r\nthe capacity. We derive the effect of the cross traffic in 
the\r\ndispersion of long packet trains, showing that the ADR is not 
the\r\navailable bandwidth in the path, as was assumed in previous 
work.\r\nPutting all the pieces together, we present a capacity

autonomous systems (ASes) grows exponentially, our understanding of 
global inter-domain Internet routing fails to keep pace. To improve the 
routing system, we need to understand better how it works now, starting 
with calibrating various methods used to analyze routing dynamics today.
 The workshop agenda first covered public sources of global routing data
 and simple growth curves of routes, address space, and AS number 
utilization. We then focused on uses of this data for routing modeling 
and analysis, including applications to traffic engineering. We had a 
session on analysis of massive topology data sets, and on tools for 
simulating very large (million-node) networks. The final session was a 
special interlude on techniques for bandwidth estimation. In this report
 we'll briefly capture the main points from each speaker, and then 
summarize highlights and results from the workshop perceived by the 
participants."

     "description": "An understanding of certain network functions is 
critical for successful network management. Managers must have insight 
into network topology, protocol performance and fault 
detection/isolation. The ability to obtain such insight is even more 
critical when trying to support evolving technologies like multicast. 
With these technologies, the pace of change is high, modifications to 
routing mechanisms are frequent, and faults are common. In this paper we
 introduce Mantra, a tool we have developed to monitor multicast. Mantra
 collects, analyzes, and visualizes network-layer (routing and topology)
 data about the global multicast infrastructure. The two most important 
functions of Mantra are: (1) monitoring multicast networks on a global 
scale; and (2) presenting results in the form of intuitive 
visualizations. To achieve accurate monitoring, Mantra collects data 
from several topologically and geographically diverse networks. For the 
purpose of presentation, Mantra uses several interactive visualization 
mechanisms to present statistics, topology maps and geographic 
properties. Another noteworthy feature of Mantra is its flexible and 
scalable architecture. This architecture helps keep our monitoring 
efforts current with the fast pace of multicast developments. It also 
enables us to expand Mantra's monitoring scope to more networks and 
larger data sets.\r\n\r\n"

for network management and cost recovery. Its history and its use 
of\nthe Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM) architecture to measure
 its traffic are\ndescribed.\n\nThe Kawaihiko members wanted a 'measured
 bandwidth' metric which would be a good\nindicator of the bandwidth 
required to carry each site's traffic. Kawaihiko developed such 
a\nmetric - the Third-Quartile Day (3QD) - based on a daily usage 
profile or Third-Quartile Profile\n(3QP). 3QP and 3QD are described in 
detail, and illustrated with typical plots from several of\nthe 
Kawaihiko sites.\n\nThe Kawaihiko members found 3QD to be an effective 
bandwidth measure, and 3QP a useful\ntraffic management tool.\n"

     "description": "When your packets travel through the Internet, 
where exactly do they\r\ngo? How many users of your web site live in 
Europe? How will your\r\nInternet service be affected by a new 
trans-pacific cable? To answer\r\nthese questions you need geographic 
information. Internet researchers\r\nfrequently need to map their 
observed data to specific places. But IP\r\naddresses, Autonomous System
 numbers, and hostnames are values in a\r\nlogical hierarchy; they 
contain no geographic information.  There is no\r\nauthoritative 
database for mapping these identifiers to locations, so\r\nseveral 
sources of network information must be used, and these sources\r\nmay be
 conflicting or incomplete. The large size of the typical data\r\nset 
used in Internet research makes manually mapping many thousands of\r\nIP
 addresses to locations impractical and imprecise; an 
automated\r\nsolution is required. In this paper we describe NetGeo, a 
tool that\r\novercomes these obstacles.\r\n\r\nNetGeo is a tool that 
maps IP addresses, domain names, and Autonomous\r\nSystem (AS) numbers 
to geographic locations. NetGeo has significant\r\npotential to support a
 variety of tasks: automatic selection of\r\ngeographically nearby 
mirror sites; ISP decisions on where to deploy\r\nnew infrastructure, 
traffic flow analysis for tariff policy research;\r\nregionally-based 
advertising design, etc. NetGeo is currently being\r\nused both in a 
graphical traceroute tool and for studies of\r\nconnectivity and traffic
 flow between countries.\r\n\r\nNetGeo can be accessed interactively via
 the web and through Java and\r\nPerl APIs. The NetGeo back-end consists
 of a database and a collection\r\nof Perl scripts for address parsing 
and heuristic analysis of whois\r\nrecords. To reduce the load on whois 
servers and to improve\r\nperformance, NetGeo caches geographic 
information parsed from previous\r\nqueries.\r\n\r\nPrior to the 
development of NetGeo, Internet geographic information was\r\nnot easily
 available. We look forward to many creative uses of this\r\ntool as 
researchers become aware of its availability.\r\n\r\n"

modeling. The reasons\nderive from the Internet's evolution as a 
composition of independently\ndeveloped and deployed (and by no means 
synergistic) protocols,\ntechnologies, and core applications. Moreover, 
this evolution, though\n\"punctuated\" by new technologies, has 
experienced no equilibrium thus\nfar.\n\nThe state of the art, or lack 
thereof, in high-speed measurement is\nneither surprising nor profound. 
It is a natural consequence of the\neconomic imperatives in the current 
industry, where empirically\ngrounded research in wide-area Internet 
modeling has been an obvious\ncasualty. Specifically, the engineering 
know-how required to develop\nadvanced measurement technologies, whether
 in software or hardware, is\nessentially the same skill set required to
 develop advanced routing and\nswitching capabilities. Since the latter 
draw far greater interest, and\nprofit, from the marketplace, it is 
where the industry allocates\nengineering talent.\n\nA common complaint 
about traffic measurement studies is that they do\nnot sustain relevance
 in this environment where traffic, technology,\nand topology change 
faster than we can measure them. Moreover, the\nproliferation of media 
and protocols make the acquisition of traffic\ndata almost prohibitively
 complicated and costly. And finally, the time\nrequired to analyze and 
validate data means that most research efforts\nare obsolete by the time
 findings are published.\n\nThus, far from having an analytic handle on 
the Internet, we lack in\nmost cases the ability even to measure traffic
 at a granularity that\nwould enable infrastructure-level research. As a
 result, while the core\nof the Internet continues its rapid evolution, 
measurement and modeling\nof it progress at a leisurely pace.\n\n"

     "description": "For the last several years, the Internet multicast 
backbone has been a growing part of the Internet infrastructure, and of 
strategic interest to the network research community experimenting 
with\r\nmulticast technologies. In particular, the MBONE has been a 
deployment testbed for scalable distribution of group audio and video 
streams. Rapid growth in topology and traffic volume of the\r\nmulticast
 infrastructure has brought inevitable scaling problems, not the least 
of which is the increased negative impact incurred by accidental 
misconfiguration of MBONE nodes. In pursuit of\r\ninsight into the MBONE
 topology, its growth characteristics, and the extent of the transition 
from the tunnel-based architecture to the deployment of native 
multicast, we developed and applied\r\nvisualization tools to the 
database of connectivity information collected with the mwatch [MWAT] 
utility from University College London. We have used two separate 
visualization tools for this\r\ntask: MantaRay [MANTA], for 
geographic-map based depiction of MBONE data collected by mrinfo 
queries; and otter [OTTER], for topological visualizations of the same 
data. \r\n\r\nMantaRay and Otter are part of the fleet of tools from the
 Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) for 
visualizing various sets of Internet data. Both tools are 
Java-based\r\nand allow users to select parts of the data, focus or zoom
 in on particular areas, color by various parameters, and generally 
explore multicast topologies. \r\n\r\n"

     "description": "Otter is a new CAIDA tool for visualizing arbitrary
 network data that\r\ncan be expressed as a set of nodes, links or 
paths. We developed Otter\r\nto handle visualization tasks for a wide 
variety of Internet data we\r\ndeal with in our research, including data
 sets on topology, workload,\r\nperformance, and routing. We have used 
Otter to visualize: multicast\r\nand unicast topology databases, core 
BGP routing tables, reachability\r\nand delay measurements, SNMP data, 
and web site directory structures.\r\nOtter's strength is in its data 
independence: it can handle any\r\nformatted data set consisting of 
links and nodes.\r\n\r\nOtter achieves its versatility in what data it 
can process by using a\r\ndata format specification prepended to each 
input file. This\r\nspecification stipulates attributes of each object 
in the data file,\r\nwhich Otter uses to tailor its visualizations and 
even adapt its user\r\ninterface to a specific data domain. We describe 
and provide examples\r\nof Otter's visualization features, how it 
achieves data independence,\r\npresent case studies of Otter's utility 
in practice, and outline\r\npossible future directions for 
Otter.\r\n\r\n"

     "description": "As the [NLANR Caching 
Hierarchy](http://ircache.nlanr.net), has\r\nincreased in size and 
complexity, researchers and users have had a more\r\ndifficult time 
depicting a comprehensive view of the overall topology.\r\n[Planet 
Cache](http://ircache.nlanr.net/Cache/cacheviz.html) was one of\r\nthe 
first attempts at visualizing the hierarchy, but was not\r\nsufficiently
 flexible to customize views of subsets of the topology by\r\nspecific 
attributes. CAIDA has expanded Planet Cache's visualization 
to\r\ninclude both topological and geographical depictions of the 
hierarchy.\r\nWe have also invested in converting from VRML to a Java 
implementation\r\nto facilitate more interactive visualization. Our Java
 implementation\r\nallows the user to tailor the complexity, focus, and 
topological layout\r\nto match their specific visualization objectives. 
This ability to\r\ncustomize the visualization, combined with the 
universal availability\r\nthat the web and Java provide, allows a much 
larger set of users to\r\naccess data on the global caching 
infrastructure and gain insight into\r\ntheir own position in the 
hierarchy. While our goal is a universally\r\naccessible visualization 
tool, problems with the platform independence\r\nof Java and privacy 
sensitivities with respect to transcribing even\r\nlogical topology 
information have resulted in our rendering some of the\r\nmore useful 
aspects of the visualization only in standalone\r\n('non-applet') 
mode.\r\n\r\nDespite these drawbacks, the user-friendly interface and 
the visually\r\ninformative and dynamic nature of both the standalone 
and the applet\r\nversion are vast improvements over currently available
 tools, and\r\nprovide a good basis for future analysis.\r\n\r\n"

Analysis (CAIDA) would\r\nlike to take this opportunity to comment on 
the quality of the data\r\nunderlying evaluation of the proposed 
MCI-Worldcom merger. CAIDA is a\r\ncollaborative undertaking by industry
 and government to promote greater\r\ncooperation in the engineering and
 maintenance of a robust, scalable\r\nglobal Internet infrastructure. 
CAIDA provides a neutral framework for\r\ncompetitors to work together 
to address current and future operational\r\nand engineering 
requirements of the commercial Internet. CAIDA's\r\ncurrent focus is on 
developing and deploying traffic measurement and\r\nanalysis tools to 
support engineering level decision-making and 
related\r\ncollaborations.\r\n\r\nThe views presented below concern the 
inadequacies of the data upon\r\nwhich the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) is basing its\r\nInternet-related decisions and the 
industry-wide failure to acquire and\r\nanalyze basic traffic statistics
 in support of business, operational,\r\nand regulatory decisions 
affecting the Internet. We [CAIDA] are not\r\nqualified to reflect on 
the economic merits or business implications of\r\nthe proposed merger, 
and question the ability of any party, including\r\nthe FCC, to make 
thoughtful decisions in this matter given the poor\r\nquality of the 
data and analyses associated with the commercial\r\nInternet.\r\n\r\nThe
 lack of reliable traffic information is ubiquitous in the 
Internet\r\nsector. The absence of detailed engineering-level data 
directly affects\r\nthe quality of Internet service providers' 
operational and capacity\r\ndecisions, the ability of government to make
 well-reasoned regulatory\r\nand economic decisions, and the ability of 
Internet hardware and\r\nsoftware vendors to develop adequate 
specifications for future\r\nproducts. The current MCI-Worldcom 
discussions provide an important\r\nopportunity for the FCC, as well as 
the Internet service providers and\r\nsuppliers, to take steps to ensure
 that future decisions will be based\r\non a detailed understanding of 
the facts and trends underpinning this\r\nstrategic industry.\r\n\r\n"

suboptimal topology is of growing concern to \r\nnetwork providers and 
the multicast research community. \r\n\r\nWe create a geographic 
representation of the tunnel structure as arcs on a \r\nglobe by 
resolving the latitude and longitude of MBone routers. The interactive 
\r\n3D maps permit an immediate understanding of the global structure 
unavailable \r\nfrom the data in its original form as lines of text with
 only hostnames and IP \r\naddresses. Data visualization techniques such
 as grouping and thresholding allow \r\nfurther analysis of specific 
aspects of the MBone topology. We distribute the \r\ninteractive 3D maps
 through the World-Wide Web using the VRML file format, thus 
\r\nallowing network maintainers throughout the world to analyze the 
structure more \r\neffectively than would be possible with still 
pictures or pre-made videos. \r\n"

     "description": "As the Internet begins to enter the popular scope, 
portending large\r\nscale changes in how society will operate, important
 questions have\r\nemerged regarding issues of fairness and 
responsibility with respect to\r\nseveral aspects of the base Internet 
architecture.\r\n\r\nThe questions are many, and all have cumbersome 
legal, financial, and\r\ncultural ramifications. We focus here on only 
one: the addressing\r\nmodel. Addresses are the technical cornerstone of
 the Internet's\r\nability to move data from sender to any connected 
receiver. The shape\r\nof the address space ultimately determines the 
effective scalability\r\nand constrains the financial model of the 
network. We contrast two\r\nmodels of address assignment, provider and 
geographic based, expanding\r\non Tsuchiya's analysis, and explore their
 ramifications.\r\n\r\nOne difficulty in discussing address space is 
that although its\r\neffective use is essential for the technical 
feasibility of Internet\r\noperation, the ownership of address space and
 the responsibility for\r\njustifying its use remain ill-defined. There 
are several revealing\r\nanalogies in other spheres, e.g., spectrum 
assignment and international\r\ntelephony. Like spectrum bands, IP 
address space is a finite and\r\ncontended resource that requires 
careful assignment and management. We\r\nnote also that it has been, and
 continues to be, particularly\r\nchallenging for regulatory bodies to 
create and enforce equitable and\r\nconsistent policies for spectrum 
allocation.\r\n\r\nInternet addressing policy must be constructed out of
 a careful balance among: \r\n\r\n* service requirements of end 
users\r\n* base technology of the network\r\n* cost effectiveness of 
service provision\r\n* ability of providers to regain infrastructure 
costs\r\n* use of the Internet as a fundamental technology of society as
 a the phone system\r\n\r\nAlthough the IETF has entertained discussion 
of addressing policy\r\nincluding all of the above issues, the Internet 
has reached a stage of\r\nmaturity and breadth of scope that requires 
wider debate of these\r\nissues."

adolescence, growing at\r\nexponential proportions, full of potential 
and promise, but still\r\nrelatively ignorant of the real world. It now 
faces a crossroads.\r\nCitizens, corporations and governments are waking
 to the opportunities\r\npresented by a truly connected global economy, 
and reexamining\r\nfundamental principles of intellectual property law 
and communications\r\nin light of the realities of cyberspace. 
Organizational behavior and\r\nboundaries, business practices and 
financial systems are also adapting\r\nto the new medium. Society is at 
the forefront of the information\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nThe number of 
North American Internet service providers pioneering this\r\nrevolution 
now stands at over 3,000, approximately a dozen of which\r\nqualify as 
national backbone providers. Internationally, the number of\r\nInternet 
hosts has almost doubled over the year ending July 1996,\r\nreaching 
12,881,000. Domains quadrupled over this period to 
488,000.1/\r\nCompetition is fierce among the builders and operators of 
this nascent\r\ninfrastructure, driven by demands for additional 
capacity and new\r\ncustomers. However, neither the industry nor the 
research community\r\nthat developed and nurtured the early Internet are
 spending significant\r\nattention on assessing current robustness or 
future capacity needs.\r\n\r\nThis paper has three goals. We first 
provide background on the current\r\nInternet architecture and describe 
why measurements are a key element\r\nin the development of a robust and
 financially successful commercial\r\nInternet. We then discuss the 
current state of Internet metrics\r\nanalysis and steps underway within 
the Internet Engineering Task Force\r\n(IETF) as well as other arenas to
 encourage the development and\r\ndeployment of Internet performance 
monitoring and workload\r\ncharacterization tools. Finally, we offer a

used as a \"handle\" for users to specify a particular computer. A 
domain name server supports database queries to map these handles to the
 corresponding IP address with which one needs to communicate, and 
insert that address into the packets that comprise the data stream sent 
to that computer. The second use is one that was not originally 
envisioned: domain names have fallen into the role of a rudimentary 
directory system. Rather than looking up the name of a specific computer
 in a directory, the way one uses a phone book, users tend to assume 
that the domain name itself is strongly related to a company name or 
service offering. The problem with this assumption is that company and 
service names are far from unique, even in a local context and far less 
so on the global Internet.\r\n\r\nWe feel that the reliance on the DNS 
for a directory service only indicates our desperate need for a real 
directory service; it does not prove that the DNS should be that

security mechanisms\r\nwith network performance. In particular, using 
encryption, such as that\r\noffered by Kerberos for interactive rlogin 
sessions, can have a\r\nsignificant adverse impact in situations where 
lower network layers\r\n(e.g., modems) try to perform compression to 
optimize transmission\r\nperformance. Such interaction between network 
layers poses an acute\r\nproblem for low-speed (e.g., dial-up) lines.  
Although it is no\r\nsurprise that encryption precludes the ability to 
perform subsequent\r\ncompression, it is worth examining its implication
 for the recent\r\npopularity of adding network security mechanisms to 
extant\r\napplications. The example we show is symbolic of a more 
general issue\r\nin distributed system engineering: if both security and
 performance are\r\ndesign goals, security cannot be an afterthought 
without expecting a\r\nsignificant loss in performance. We must thus 
design security as well\r\nas performance _into_ the architecture, 
rather than on top of it.\r\n\r\n"

     "datePublished": "1994.11",
     "date": "199411",
     "description": "The current architecture and implementation of the 
Internet assumes a vast aggregation of traffic from many sources and 
stochastic distribution of traffic both in space (traffic source) and 
time (burstiness of traffic volume). Given this general assumption, 
Internet components typically have little if any ability to control the 
volume and distribution of incoming traffic. As a result the network, 
particularly from the perspective of the router, is vulnerable to 
significant consumption of networking resources by high-volume 
applications, with possibly little stochastic behavior, from a few 
users. This often impacts the overall profile of network traffic as 
aggregated from many clients. An example is the continuous flows 
introduced by real time applications such as packet audio, video, or 
rapidly changing graphics.\r\n\r\nThis situation creates a time window 
where applications exist on a network not designed for them, but before 
an appropriately architected network can augment the current 
infrastructure and cope with the new type of workload.  We propose a 
scheme for voluntarily setting Internet traffic priorities by end-users 
and applications, using the existing 3-bit Precedence field in the 
Internet Protocol header.\r\n\r\nOur proposal has three elements.  
First, network routers would queue incoming packets by IP Precedence 
value instead of the customary single-threaded FIFO. Second, users and 
their applications would voluntarily use different and appropriate 
precedence values in their outgoing transmissions according to some 
defined criteria.  Third, network service providers may monitor the 
precedence levels of traffic entering their network, and use some 
mechanism such as a quota system to discourage users from setting high 
precedence values on all their traffic.  All three elements can be 
implemented gradually and selectively across the Internet 
infrastructure, providing a smooth transition path from the present 
system.  The experience we gain from an implementation will furthermore 
provide a valuable knowledge base from which to develop sound accounting
 and billing mechanisms and policies in the future.\r\n"

     "description": "Traffic statistics normally collected during 
day-to-day operation of wide-area datagram networks are frequently 
insufficient for researchers to use in studying the workloads and 
performance of these realistic environments.  As wide-area networks 
become more ubiquitous and service expectations rise, current methods 
for collecting data will become even less suitable.  We examine ways to 
improve techniques for statistics collection so that the resulting data 
will enable researchers, and indeed service providers themselves, to 
develop more accurate Internet traffic models.\r\n\r\nWe first provide a
 taxonomy of traffic characterization tasks. We then use operationally 
collected statistics to characterize traffic of the T1 and T3 NSFNET 
backbones.  Because current infrastructural statistics collection is 
oriented toward either short term operational requirements or periodic 
simplistic traffic reports to funding agencies, this data \r\nis often 
not conducive to assessing network workload or performance; we evaluate 
to what extent they are useful for tasks in the taxonomy, and propose 
improvements in current statistics collection architectures, with 
particular application to the NSFNET backbone.  We include an 
investigation of the effects of sampling to characterize traffic and 
evaluate performance in a high-speed wide-area network 
environment.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of the thesis we focus on items 
in the outlined taxonomy that are not conducive to investigation using 
operationally collected statistics.  These items mostly involve 
short-term aspects of Internet flows, which operationally collected 
statistics fail to expose.  We develop a general methodology for use in 
assessing Internet flow profiles and their impact on an aggregate 
Internet workload.  Our methodology for profiling flows differs from 
many previous studies that have concentrated on end-point definitions of
 flows defined by TCP connections using the TCP SYN and FIN control 
mechanism.  We focus on the IP layer and define flows based on traffic 
satisfying various temporal and spatial locality conditions, as observed
 at internal points of the network.  We first define the parameter space
 and then concentrate on metrics characterizing both individual flows 
and the aggregate flow.  Metrics of individual flows include: volume in 
\r\npackets and bytes per flow, and flow duration.  Metrics of the 
aggregate flow, or workload characteristics from the network 
perspective, include:  counts of the number of active, new, and timed 
out flows per time interval; flow \r\ninterarrival and arrival 
processes; and flow locality metrics.  Applying the methodology to our 
measurements yields significant observations of the Internet 
infrastructure, which have implications for performance requirements 
\r\nof routers at Internet hotspots, general and specialized flow-based 
routing algorithms, future usage-based accounting requirements, and 
traffic prioritization.\r\n\r\nFinally, we discuss trends that will 
affect how Internet service providers collect statistics in the future. 
 Improvements in operational statistics collection, such as support for 
flow assessment, will help networking activities along various time 
horizons, from defining service quality patterns to long-term capacity 
planning.  We offer a unique combination of operational and research 
perspectives, allowing us to reduce the gaps among (1) what network 
service providers need; (2) what statistics service providers can 
provide; and (3) what network analysis requires."

     "description": "The current Internet aggregates flows of traffic 
among many\nend systems, users, and applications. Characterizing the 
nature of these\nflows will be critical to accomodating the increasing 
number and\ndiversity of the Internet traffic flows. We present a 
methodology for\nprofiling Internet traffic flows at a variety of flow 
granularities. Our\nmethodology for modeling flows differs from many 
previous studies that\nhave concentrated on end-point definitions of 
flows defined by TCP\nconnections using the SYN and FIN control 
mechanism. Instead, we focus\non the IP layer and define flows based on 
traffic satisfying various\ntemporal and spatial locality conditions, as
 observed at internal points\nof the network. This approach to the 
definition and characterization of\nnetwork flows may help address some 
central problems for networking\nbased on the Internet model. Among them
 are route caching, resource\nreservation at multiple service levels, 
usage based accounting, and the\nintegration of IP traffic over an ATM 
fabric. In this paper we first\ndefine the parameter space and then 
concentrate on metrics\ncharacterizing individual flows, including flow 
duration and flow volume\nin both packets and bytes. We consider various
 granularities of the\ndefinition of a flow, such as by destination 
network, host pair, or host\nand port quadruple. Our measurements 
demonstrate (i) the brevity of a\nsignificant fraction of IP flows (ii) 
that the number of host-pair IP\nflows is not significantly larger than 
the destination network flows,\nand (iii) that schemes for caching 
traffic information could benefit by\nmaching caching decisions taking 
into account higher layer information.\n"

latencies to\r\nselected destinations of the Internet utilizing a 
variety of paths. The\r\nobjective is to demonstrate that round-trip 
latencies are an\r\ninsufficient and sometimes misleading method to 
determine unidirectional\r\ndelays. This claim has significant 
implications for high-speed,\r\nmulti-application, wide-area, traffic 
aggregating networking\r\nenvironments which often require 
predictability of precise delay.\r\n\r\nAssuming that a round trip path 
is symetric and dividing a RTT\r\nin half to find the latency in either 
the outgoing or incoming\r\ntranmission path is highly inaccurate as 
there are both static and\r\ndu\\ynamic reasons for the paths traversed 
by packets between hosts to be\r\nasymetric. The static reason is that 
the route may be permanently\r\nconfigured to be asymetric because of 
network harware limitations (for\r\nexample simplex links). The dynamic 
reasons for asymetrically datagram\r\npaths are resource contentions 
between other components in the network.\r\nDigitial continuous media 
networked applications require good\r\npredicatability of unidirectional
 network delays, which simply halving\r\nthe RTT cannot give."

various sampling approaches, including\r\ntime-driven and event-driven 
methods, with both random and deterministic\r\nselection patterns, at a 
variety of granularities. Using several metrics\r\nwhich indicate the 
similarity between two distributions, we then compare\r\nthe sampled 
traces to the parent population. Our results revealed that\r\nthe 
time-triggered techniques did not perform as well as 
the\r\npacket-triggered ones. Furthermore, the performance differences 
within\r\neach class (packet-based or time-based techniques) are 
small.\r\n"

magnitude and pattern of the flow of\r\nrouting information directly 
represents the connectivity stability of\r\nthe Internet. The NSFNET 
backbone network provides transit services to\r\na large portion of the 
global Internet and maintains routing tables\r\nreflecting this current 
connectivity. These routing tables are\r\nconstantly updated based on 
information received by the attached\r\nnetworks. This paper 
investigates the dynamics of routing information\r\nflow as presented to
 the NSFNET backbone network.\r\n\r\n"

     "description": "The current TCP/IP Internet may be modeled as an 
arbitrary\ninterconnection of autonomous systems (AS). An AS is defined 
to be a\ncollection of internetwork routers managed and administered by a
 single\nauthority or organization. Typically an AS uses a single 
routing\nprotocol within its boundaries to generate and propagate 
routing\ninformation. In this paper we analyse the performance of a 
technique\nthat injects only partial reachability information derived 
from the\ninter-AS routing into the intra-AS routing.\n\nThis 
performance evaluation is based on traffic data obtained from 
the\nNSFNET backbone. We show, for instance, that injecting just 10% of 
the\ntotal inter-AS reachability information into the intra-AS 
routing\npermits the forwarding of at least 85% of the transit traffic 
without\nresorting to fallback _fault_ mechanisms."
