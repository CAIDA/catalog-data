     "description": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is widely expected to make our society safer, smarter, and more sustainable. However, a key challenge remains, which is how to protect users and Internet infrastructure operators from attacks on or launched through vast numbers of autonomously operating sensors and actuators. In this paper, we discuss how the security extensions of the Domain Name System (DNS) offer an opportunity to help tackle that challenge, while also outlining the risks that the IoT poses to the DNS in terms of complex and quickly growing IoT-powered Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. We identify three challenges for the DNS and IoT industries to seize these opportunities and address the risks, for example by making DNS security functions (e.g., response verification and encryption) available on popular IoT operating systems.

     "description": "Interconnection links connecting broadband access providers with their peers, transit providers and major content providers, are a potential point of discriminatory treatment and impairment of user experience. However, adequate data to shed light on this situation is lacking, and different actors can put forward opportunistic interpretations of data to support their points of view. In this article, we introduce a topology-aware model of interconnection to elucidate our own beliefs about how to measure interconnection links of access providers and how policy- makers should interpret the results. We use six case studies that show how our conceptual model can guide a critical analysis of what is or should be measured and reported, and how to soundly interpret these measurements. "

     "datePublished": "2020.6",
     "description": "Current methods to analyze the Internet’s router-level topology with paths collected using traceroute assume that the source address for each router in the path is either an inbound or off-path address on each router. In this work, we show that outbound addresses are common in our Internet-wide traceroute dataset collected by CAIDA's Ark vantage points in January 2020, accounting for 1.7% – 5.8% of the addresses seen at some point before the end of a traceroute. This phenomenon can lead to mistakes in Internet topology analysis, such as inferring router ownership and identifying interdomain links. We hypothesize that the primary contributor to outbound addresses is Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks (L3VPNs), and propose vrfinder, a technique for identifying L3VPN outbound addresses in traceroute collections. We validate vrfinder against ground truth from two large research and education networks, demonstrating high precision (100.0%) and recall (82.1% – 95.3%). We also show the benefit of accounting for L3VPNs in traceroute analysis through extensions to bdrmapIT, increasing the accuracy of its router ownership inferences for L3VPN outbound addresses from 61.5% - 79.4% to 88.9% - 95.5%."

,
     "datePublished": "2020.6",
     "description": "DNS zone administration is a complex task involving manual work and several entities and can therefore result in misconfigurations. Orphan records are one of these misconfigurations, in which a glue record for a delegation that does not exist anymore is forgotten in the zone file. Orphan records are a security hazard to third-party domains that have these records in their delegation, as an attacker may easily hijack such domains by registering the domain associated with the orphan. The goal of this paper is to quantify this misconfiguration, extending previous work by Kalafut et al., by identifying a new type of glue record misconfiguration – which we refer to as abandoned records – and by performing a broader characterization. Our results highlight how the situation has changed, not always for the better, compared to a decade-old study."

Circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic led to completing the Final Report approximately 55 days beyond the Bylaw-mandated one year, but within budget and proposed terms of reference. ATRT3 is grateful to the Board for their allowance and understanding. Over the course of its work, several unforeseen events have occurred that ATRT3 considers subjects for accountability and transparency review of the Board, the ICANN organization (org), and the community. ATRT3 discussed and made conscious decisions to not address some specific items due to where we were in the process at the time they were raised or occurred, the events not having drawn to a conclusion, unavailability of documents to review, lack of consensus to undertake the topic, and our limitations on time, resource, and budget. We do however wish to highlight these issues to ensure the ICANN community that these are indeed important issues for the accountability and transparency of ICANN. "

     "description": "As a member of ATRT3 review team, and per the current Operating Procedures for Specific Reviews, I (kc claffy) respectfully object to ATRT3’s recommendation on the future of reviews. The report recommends terminating all Specific Reviews except their own (ATRT): the Security, Stability, and Resiliency Review (SSR), the Competition, Consumer Trust, and Consumer Choice Review (CCT) and the Registration Directory Service (RDS) Review (formerly WHOIS Review). More precisely, the report recommends to suspend any further SSR or RDS reviews until and unless a future ATRT deems them necessary again, and to allow only one additional CCT review, but not until after the next round of new gTLDs. The report recommends replacing these terminated reviews with a single new holistic review approximately every 8 years, a remarkably long time for the Internet industry. In addition, the report recommends terminating all independent organizational reviews and replacing them with self-directed, i.e., not independent, “continuous improvement programs which have to produce a status report at least every three years.” Implementing these changes would require substantial changes to ICANN’s Bylaws."

     "datePublished": "2020.4",
     "description": "Knowledge about the geographic locations of Internet routers and servers is highly valuable for research on various aspects of Internet structure, performance, economics, and security. Whereas databases for geolocation are commercially available and targeted mostly at end hosts, RIPE offers an open IPmap platform, including its single-radius engine, for geolocation of core Internet infrastructure. This paper introduces the research community to the IPmap single-radius engine and evaluates effectiveness of this method versus commercial geolocation databases NetAcuity and GeoLite2. Access to ground truth constitutes a major challenge in conducting such evaluation studies. The paper collects IP addresses for its study from three sources: virtual machines from the Ring of the Netherlands Network Operators’ Group, M-Lab Pods operated by Google, and CAIDA’s Ark monitors. The ground truth dataset is further diversified through addition of IP addresses that are small latency away from Ark monitors. The evaluation considers accuracy, coverage, and consistency of geolocation as well as effectiveness of the single-radius method for different types of autonomous systems. The paper manually analyzes a problematic case where single-radius mistakenly geolocates an IP address of a Budapest-based router to Vienna. Finally, the paper provides recommendations to both users and developers of the single-radius method and discusses limitations of the reported evaluation. The main conclusion is that the IPmap single-radius engine geolocates core Internet infrastructure more accurately than the considered commercial databases and that Internet researchers can greatly benefit from using the IPmap platform for their geolocation needs."

     "description": "Uncovering the Internet’s router graph is vital to accurate measurement and analysis. In this paper, we present a new technique for resolving router IP aliases that complements existing techniques. Our approach, Alias Pruning by Path Length Estimation (apple), avoids relying on router manufacturer and operating system specific implementations of IP. Instead, it filters potential router aliases seen in traceroute by comparing the reply path length from each address to a distributed set of vantage points. We evaluated our approach on Internet-wide collections of IPv4 and IPv6 traceroutes. We compared apple’s router alias inferences against router configurations from two R\u0026E networks, finding no false positives. Moreover, apple’s coverage of the potential alias pairs in the ground truth networks rivals the current state-of-the-art in IPv4, and far exceeds existing techniques in IPv6. We also show that apple complements existing alias resolution techniques, increasing the total number of inferred alias pairs by 109.6% in IPv4, and by 1071.5% in IPv6."

     "description": "The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical, decentralized, and distributed database. A key mechanism that enables the DNS to be hierarchical and distributed is delegation of responsibility from parent to child zones—typically managed by different entities. RFC1034 states that authoritative nameserver (NS) records at both parent and child should be \"consistent and remain so\", but we find inconsistencies for over 13M second-level domains. We classify the type of inconsistencies we observe, and the behavior of resolvers in the face of such inconsistencies, using RIPE Atlas to probe our experimental domain configured for different scenarios. Our results underline the risk such inconsistencies pose to the availability of misconfigured domains."

,
     "datePublished": "2020.3",
     "description": "We use traceroute and BGP data from globally distributed Internet measurement infrastructures to study the impact of a noteworthy submarine cable launch connecting Africa to South America. We leverage archived data from RIPE Atlas and CAIDA Ark platforms, as well as custom measurements from strategic vantage points, to quantify the differences in end-to-end latency and path lengths before and after deployment of this new South-Atlantic cable. We find that ASes operating in South America significantly benefit from this new cable, with reduced latency to all measured African countries. More surprising is that end-to-end latency to/from some regions of the world, including intra-African paths towards Angola, increased after switching to the cable. We track these unintended consequences to suboptimally circuitous IP paths that traveled from Africa to Europe, possibly North America, and South America before traveling back to Africa over the cable. Although some suboptimalities are expected given the lack of peering among neighboring ASes in the developing world, we found two other causes: (i) problematic intra-domain routing within a single Angolese network, and (ii) suboptimal routing/traffic engineering by its BGP neighbors. After notifying the operating AS of our results, we found that most of these suboptimalities were subsequently resolved. We designed our method to generalize to the study of other cable deployments or outages and share our code to promote reproducibility and extension of our work"

     "description": "Active measurement tools are important to understand and diagnose performance bottlenecks on the Internet. However, their overhead is a concern because a high number of additional measurement packets can congest the network they try to measure. To address this issue, prior work has proposed in-band approaches that piggyback application traffic for active measurements. However, prior approaches are hard to deploy because they require either specialized hardware or modifications in the Linux kernel. In this paper, we propose FlowTrace–a readily deployable user-space active measurement framework that leverages application TCP flows to carry out in-band network measurements. Our implementation of Pathneck using FlowTrace creates recursive packet trains to locate bandwidth bottlenecks. The experimental evaluation on a testbed shows that FlowTrace is able to locate bandwidth bottlenecks as accurately as Pathneck with significantly less overhead."

,
     "datePublished": "2020.1",
     "description": "Securing the Internet’s inter-domain routing system against illicit prefix advertisements by third-party networks remains a great concern for the research, standardization, and operator communities. After many unsuccessful attempts to deploy additional security mechanisms for BGP, we now witness increasing adoption of the RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure). Backed by strong cryptography, the RPKI allows network operators to register their BGP prefixes together with the legitimate Autonomous System (AS) number that may originate them via BGP. Recent research shows an encouraging trend: an increasing number of networks around the globe start to register their prefixes in the RPKI. While encouraging, the actual benefit of registering prefixes in the RPKI eventually depends on whether transit providers in the Internet enforce the RPKI’s content, i.e., configure their routers to validate prefix announcements and filter invalid BGP announcements. In this work, we present a broad empirical study tackling the question: To what degree does registration in the RPKI protect a network from illicit announcements of their prefixes, such as prefix hijacks? To this end, we first present a longitudinal study of filtering behavior of transit providers in the Internet, and second we carry out a detailed study of the visibility of legitimate and illegitimate prefix announcements in the global routing table, contrasting prefixes registered in the RPKI with those not registered. We find that an increasing number of transit and access providers indeed do enforce RPKI filtering, which translates to a direct benefit for the networks using the RPKI in the case of illicit announcements of their address space. Our findings bode well for further RPKI adoption and for increasing routing security in the Internet."

The objective of the KISMET project is to improve the security and resilience of key Internet systems by collecting and curating infrastructure data in a form that facilitates query, integration and analysis. This project is a part of NSF’s new Convergence Accelerator program, which seeks to support fundamental scientific exploration by creating partnerships across public and private sectors to solve problems of national importance."

     "description": "Ascertaining that a network will forward spoofed traffic usually requires an active probing vantage point in that network, effectively preventing a comprehensive view of this global Internet vulnerability. Recently, researchers have proposed using Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) as observatories to detect spoofed packets, by leveraging Autonomous System (AS) topology knowledge extracted from Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) data to infer which source addresses should legitimately appear across parts of the IXP switch fabric. We demonstrate that the existing literature does not capture several fundamental challenges to this approach, including noise in BGP data sources, heuristic AS relationship inference, and idiosyncrasies in IXP interconnectivity fabrics. We propose a novel method to navigate these challenges, leveraging _customer cone_ semantics of AS relationships to guide precise classification of inter-domain traffic as in-cone, out-of-cone (_spoofed_), unverifiable, bogon, and unassigned. We apply our method to a mid-size IXP with approximately 200 members, and find an upper bound volume of out-of-cone traffic to be more than an order of magnitude less than the previous method inferred on the same data. Our work illustrates the subtleties of scientific assessments of operational Internet infrastructure, and the need for a community focus on reproducing and repeating previous methods."

     "description": "We use historical BGP data and recent active measurements to analyze trends in the growth, structure, dynamics and performance of the evolving IPv6 Internet, and compare them to the evolution of IPv4. We find that the IPv6 network is maturing, albeit slowly, and notably IPv6 growth at the AS-level appears to have slowed after 2012. While most core Internet transit providers have deployed IPv6, edge networks are lagging. Early IPv6 network deployment was stronger in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, than in North America. Current IPv6 network deployment still shows the same pattern. The IPv6 topology is characterized by a single dominant player – Hurricane Electric – which appears in a large fraction of IPv6 AS paths, and is more dominant in IPv6 than the most dominant player in IPv4. Routing dynamics in the IPv6 topology are largely similar to those in IPv4, and churn in both networks grows at the same rate as the underlying topologies. Our measurements suggest that performance over IPv6 paths is now largely comparable to (or better than) that over IPv4 paths."

,
     "datePublished": "2019.11",
     "description": "The Spoofer project has collected data on the deployment and characteristics of IP source address validation on the Internet since 2005. Data from the project comes from participants who install an active probing client that runs in the background. The client automatically runs tests both periodically and when it detects a new network attachment point. We analyze the rich dataset of Spoofer tests in multiple dimensions: across time, networks, autonomous systems, countries, and by Internet protocol version. In our data for the year ending August 2019, at least a quarter of tested ASes did not filter packets with spoofed source addresses leaving their networks. We show that routers performing Network Address Translation do not always filter spoofed packets, as 6.4% of IPv4/24 tested in the year ending August 2019 did not filter. Worse, at least two thirds of tested ASes did not filter packets entering their networks with source addresses claiming to be from within their network that arrived from outside their network. We explore several approaches to encouraging remediation and the challenges of evaluating their impact. While we have been able to remediate 352 IPv4/24, we have found an order of magnitude more IPv4/24 that remains unremediated, despite myriad remediation strategies, with 21% unremediated for more than six months. Our analysis provides the most complete and confident picture of the Internet’s susceptibility to date of this long-standing vulnerability. Although there is no simple solution to address the remaining long-tail of unremediated networks, we conclude with a discussion of possible non-technical interventions, and demonstrate how the platform can support evaluation of the impact of such interventions over time."

     "datePublished": "2019.10",
     "description": "BGP hijacks remain an acute problem in today’s Internet, with widespread consequences. While hijack detection systems are readily available, they typically rely on a priori prefix-ownership information and are reactive in nature. In this work, we take on a new perspective on BGP hijacking activity: we introduce and track the long-term routing behavior of serial hijackers, networks that repeatedly hijack address blocks for malicious purposes, often over the course of many months or even years. Based on a ground truth dataset that we construct by extracting information from network operator mailing lists, we illuminate the dominant routing characteristics of serial hijackers, and how they differ from legitimate networks.We then distill features that can capture these behavioral differences and train a machine learning model to automatically identify Autonomous Systems (ASes) that exhibit characteristics similar to serial hijackers. Our classifier identifies ≈ 900 ASes with similar behavior in the global IPv4 routing table. We analyze and categorize these networks, finding a wide range of indicators of malicious activity, misconfiguration, as well as benign hijacking activity. Our work presents a solid first step towards identifying and understanding this important category of networks, which can aid network operators in taking proactive measures to defend themselves against prefix hijacking and serve as input for current and future detection systems."

     "datePublished": "2019.10",
     "description": "We present the design, implementation, evaluation, and validation of a system that automatically learns to extract router names (router identifiers) from hostnames stored by network operators in different DNS zones, which we represent by regular expressions (regexes). Our supervised-learning approach evaluates automatically generated candidate regexes against sets of hostnames for IP addresses that other alias resolution techniques previously inferred to identify interfaces on the same router. Conceptually, if three conditions hold: (1) a regex extracts the same value from a set of hostnames associated with IP addresses on the same router; (2) the value is unique to that router; and (3) the regex extracts names for multiple routers in the suffix, then we conclude the regex accurately represents the naming convention for the suffix. We train our system using router aliases inferred from active probing to learn regexes for 2550 different suffixes.\r\n\r\nWe then demonstrate the utility of this system by using the regexes to find 105% additional aliases for these suffixes. Regexes inferred in IPv4 perfectly predict aliases for ≈85% of suffixes with IPv6 aliases, i.e., IPv4 and IPv6 addresses representing the same underlying router, and find 9.0 times more routers in IPv6 than found by prior techniques."

     "description": "In previous papers, Lehr and Sicker (2018a,b) argued that the changing character of our telecommunications infrastructure called for a new regulatory approach, with a new Communications Act to define the duties and authorities of a reconceptualized FCC (what we call newFCC in this paper). \r\n\r\nToday's Internet ecosystem is comprised of multiple digital network platforms organized into a multi-layer architecture. Lower layer IP platforms provided by access and backbone ISPs collectively support the Internet, on which complementors can build higher-layer platforms, such as the platforms provided by powerful firms such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. These firms control and operate multiple platforms within the larger Internet ecosystem. When dominant platform providers pursue multi-platform strategies in an effort to capture or control a market, such strategies confound current methods for defining markets and assessing market power.\r\n\r\nThis paper draws on the layered platform nature of the Internet ecosystem, as described in Claffy and Clark (2014), to illustrate how this layered character of today’s Internet ecosystem calls for new regulatory authority. This paper draws on the layered platform model to scope the duties for an agency (or agencies) with sector-specific expertise."

     "description": "The Internet is transforming our society, necessitating a quantitative understanding of Internet traffic. Our team collects and curates the largest publicly available Internet traffic data containing 50 billion packets. Utilizing a novel hypersparse neural network analysis of “video” streams of this traffic using 10,000 processors in the MIT SuperCloud reveals a new phenomena: the importance of otherwise unseen leaf nodes and isolated links in Internet traffic. Our neural network approach further shows that a two-parameter modified Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution accurately describes a wide variety of source/destination statistics on moving sample windows ranging from 100,000 to 100,000,000 packets over collections that span years and continents. The inferred model parameters distinguish different network streams and the model leaf parameter strongly correlates with the fraction of the traffic in different underlying network topologies. The hypersparse neural network pipeline is highly adaptable and different network statistics and training models can be incorporated with simple changes to the image filter functions."

     "description": "There is recent evidence that the core of the Internet, which was formerly dominated by large transit providers, has been reshaped after the transition to a multimedia-oriented network, first by general-purpose CDNs and now by private CDNs. In this work we use k-cores, an element of graph theory, to define which ASes compose the core of the Internet and to track the evolution of the core since 1999. Specifically, we investigate whether large players in the Internet content and CDN ecosystem belong to the core and, if so, since when. In addition, we examine differences between the IPv4 and IPv6 cores. We further investigate regional differences in the evolution of large content providers. Finally, we show that the core of the Internet has incorporated an increasing number of content ASes in recent years. To enable reproducibility of this work, we provide a website to allow interactive analysis of our datasets to detect, for example, “up and coming” ASes using customized queries."

,
     "datePublished": "2019.9",
     "description": "One foundational justification for regulatory intervention is that there are harms occurring of a character that create a public interest in mitigating them. This paper is concerned with such harms that arise in the Internet ecosystem. Looking at news headlines for the last few years, it may seem that the range of such harms is unbounded. Hoping to add some order to the chaos, we undertake an effort to classify harms in the Internet ecosystem, in pursuit of a more or less complete taxonomy of harms. Our goal in structuring this taxonomy is to facilitate conversations and ideas to help mitigate harms in a more systematic way, as opposed to fighting an endless defensive battle against whatever happens next.\r\n\r\nThe background we bring to this paper is on the one hand architectural--how the Internet ecosystem is actually structured---and on the other hand empirical--how we should measure the Internet to best understand what is happening. If everything were wonderful about the Internet today, the need to measure and understand would not be so compelling. A justification for measurement follows from its ability to shed light on problems and challenges. Sustained measurement or compelled reporting of data, and the analysis of the collected data, generally comes at considerable effort and cost, so must be justified by an argument that it will shed light on something important. This reasoning naturally motivates our taxonomy of things that are wrong--what we call harms. That is where we, the research community generally, and governments should focus attention. We do not intend this paper as a catalog of pessimism, but to help define an action agenda for the research community and for governments. The structure of the paper proceeds \"up the layers\", from technology to society. For harms that are closer to the technology, we can be more specific about the harms, and more specific about possible measurements and remedies, and actors that could undertake them.\r\n\r\nOne motivation for this paper is that we believe the Internet ecosystem is at an inflection point. The Internet has revolutionized our ability to store, move, and process information, including information about people, and we are only at the beginning of understanding its impact on society and how to manage and mitigate harms resulting from unregulated commercial use of these capabilities. Current events suggest that now is a point of transition from laissez-faire to regulation. However, the path to good regulation is not obvious, and now is the time for the research community to think hard about what advice to give the governments of the world, and what sort of data can back up that advice. Our highest-level goal for this paper is to contribute to a conversation along those lines."

     "description": "Weather is a leading threat to the stability of our vital infrastructure. Last-mile Internet is no exception. Yet, unlike other vital infrastructure, weather’s effect on last-mile Internet outages is not well understood. This work is the first attempt to quantify the effect of weather on residential outages. \r\n\r\nInvestigating outages in residential networks due to weather is challenging because residential Internet is heterogeneous: there are different media types, different protocols, and different providers, in varying contexts of different local climate and geography. Sensitivity to these different factors leads to narrow categories when estimating how weather affects these different links. To address these issues we perform a large-scale study looking at eight years of active outage measurements that were collected across the bulk of the last mile Internet infrastructure in the United States."

Researchers have employed crowdsourcing-based approaches to achieve scale and diversity of subjects, but not without confounding factors. Apart from subjective bias of users, environmental factors introduce variance to QoE measurements. We propose QUINCE, a QoE measurement platform, which uses a gamified approach to enable longitudinal study with repeated and varying measurements in a single platform. We leveraged existing Internet measurement data and infrastructures to integrate three different types of network and QoE measurements to yield a more comprehensive view of subjects. Our preliminarily results show that QUINCE achieves a high level of engagement from subjects and collects data that is useful for correlating network performance and YouTube video streaming QoE."

Exploiting such reconfigurability requires the design of a system that can enable a configuration, measure the impact on the application performance (Quality of Experience), and adaptively select a new configuration. Effectively, this feedback loop is a Markov Decision Process whose parameters are unknown. The goal of this work is to design, develop and demonstrate QFlow that instantiates this feedback loop as an application of reinforcement learning (RL). Our context is that of reconfigurable (priority) queueing, and we use the popular application of video streaming as our use case. We develop both model-free and model-based RL approaches that are tailored to the problem of determining which clients should be assigned to which queue at each decision period. Through experimental validation, we show how the RL-based control policies on QFlow are able to schedule the right clients for prioritization in a high-load scenario to outperform the status quo, as well as the best known solutions with over 25% improvement in QoE, and a perfect QoE score of 5 over 85% of the time."

,
     "datePublished": "2019.7",
     "description": "Anycast has been widely adopted by today’s Internet services, including DNS, CDN, and DDoS protection, in which the same IP address is announced from distributed locations and clients are directed to the topologically-nearest service replica. Prior research has focused on various aspects of anycast, either its usage in particular services such as DNS or characterizing its adoption by Internetwide active probing methods. In this paper, we first explore an alternative approach to characterize anycast based on previously collected global BGP routing information. Leveraging state-of-the-art active measurement results as near-ground-truth, our passive method without requiring any Internet-wide probes can achieve 90% accuracy in detecting anycast prefixes. More importantly, our approach uncovers anycast prefixes that have been missed by prior datasets based on active measurements. While investigating the root causes of inaccuracy, we reveal that anycast routing has been entangled with the increased adoption of remote peering, a type of layer-2 interconnection where an IP network may peer at an IXP remotely without being physically present at the IXP. The invisibility of remote peering from layer-3 breaks the assumption of the shortest AS paths on BGP and causes an unintended impact on anycast performance. We identify such cases from BGP routing information and observe that at least 19.2% of anycast prefixes have been potentially impacted by remote peering."

This workshop series provides a forum for stakeholders in Internet active measurement projects to communicate their interests and concerns, and explore cooperative approaches to maximizing the collective benefit of deployed infrastructure and gathered data. An overarching theme this year was scaling the storage, indexing, annotation, and usage of Internet measurements. We discussed tradeoffs in use of commercial cloud services to to make measurement results more accessible and informative to researchers in various disciplines. Other agenda topics included status updates on recent measurement infrastructures and community feedback; measurement of poorly configured infrastructure; and recent successes and approaches to evolving challenges in geolocation, topology, route hijacking, and performance measurement. We review highlights of discussions of the talks. This report does not cover each topic discussed; for more details examine workshop presentations linked from the workshop web page: https://www.caida.org/workshops/aims/1904/"

     "description": "In this article, we study the political use of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, a particular form of cyberattack that disables web services by flooding them with high levels of data traffic. We argue that websites in nondemocratic regimes should be especially prone to this type of attack, particularly around political focal points such as elections. This is due to two mechanisms: governments employ DoS attacks to censor regime-threatening information, while at the same time, activists use DoS attacks as a tool to publicly undermine the government's authority. We analyze these mechanisms by relying on measurements of DoS attacks based on large-scale Internet traffic data. Our results show that in authoritarian countries, elections indeed increase the number of DoS attacks. However, these attacks do not seem to be directed primarily against the country itself but rather against other states that serve as hosts for news websites from this country."

     "description": "Monitoring mobile network performance is critical for optimizing the QoE of mobile apps. Until now, few studies have considered the actual network performance that mobile apps experience in a per-app or per-server granularity. In this paper, we analyze a two-year-long dataset collected by a crowdsourcing per-app measurement tool to gain new insights into mobile network behavior and application performance. We observe that only a small portion of WiFi networks can work in high-speed mode, and more than one-third of the observed ISPs still have not deployed 4G networks. For cellular networks, the DNS settings on smartphones can have a significant impact on mobile app network performance. Moreover, we notice that instant messaging (IM) and voice over IP (VoIP) services nowadays are not as performant as Web services, because the traffic using XMPP experiences longer latencies than HTTPS. We propose an automatic performance degradation detection and localization method for finding possible network problems in our huge, imbalanced and sparse dataset. Our evaluation and case studies show that our method is effective and the running time is acceptable."

     "description": "Geo-locating BGP prefixes can help us understand routing anomalies, prefix aggregation, or reveal what regions are affected by an Internet outage. Our work shows that the naive approach to prefix geo-location—simply mapping each IP address to its corresponding geo-location—can be ambiguous because a prefix may contain another, separately-announced prefix that maps to a different geographical location. Should the containing prefix also map to the locations of the contained prefix? We show that this question is difficult to answer and characterize the scope of these ambiguities by geo-locating around 680,000 prefixes to countries, regions, and cities using both GeoLite and NetAcuity Edge. We find that 0.3% of prefixes are ambiguous with respect to countries but these prefixes constitute 8.5% of the IPv4 address space. In the second part of our work, we study the mappings from prefix to location. We find that most prefixes map to only a single city but the shorter a prefix, the more locations it maps to. Our dataset however contains outliers, e.g., a /23 that maps to as many as 127 (potentially spoofed) countries. Our work takes a first look at prefix geo-location and identifies issues one should be aware of, which paves the way towards more sophisticated applications such as the geo-location of autonomous systems. We make our code and datasets publicly available to facilitate further analysis."

     "description": "The Internet is a complex ecosystem composed of thousands of Autonomous Systems (ASs) operated by independent organizations; each AS having a very limited view outside its own network. These complexities and limitations impede network operators to finely pinpoint the causes of service degradation or disruption when the problem lies outside of their network. In this paper, we present Chocolatine, a solution to detect remote connectivity loss using Internet Background Radiation (IBR) through a simple and efficient method. IBR is unidirectional unsolicited Internet traffic, which is easily observed by monitoring unused address space. IBR features two remarkable properties: it is originated worldwide, across diverse ASs, and it is incessant. We show that the number of IP addresses observed from an AS or a geographical area follows a periodic pattern. Then, using Seasonal ARIMA to statistically model IBR data, we predict the number of IPs for the next time window. Significant deviations from these predictions indicate an outage. We evaluated Chocolatine using data from the UCSD Network Telescope, operated by CAIDA, with a set of documented outages. Our experiments show that the proposed methodology achieves a good trade-off between true-positive rate (90%) and false- positive rate (2%) and largely outperforms CAIDA’s own IBR based detection method. Furthermore, performing a comparison against other methods, i.e., with BGP monitoring and active probing, we observe that Chocolatine shares a large common set of outages with them in addition to many specific outages that would otherwise go undetected."

     "description": "Recent reports show that BGP hijacking has increased substantially. BGP hijacking allows malicious ASes to obtain IP prefixes for spamming as well as intercepting or blackholing traffic. While systems to prevent hijacks are hard to deploy and require the cooperation of many other organizations, techniques to detect hijacks have been a popular area of study. In this paper, we classify detected hijack events in order to document BGP detectors output and understand the nature of reported events. We introduce four categories of BGP hijack: typos, prepending mistakes, origin changes, and forged AS paths. We leverage AS hegemony – a measure of dependency in AS relationship – to identify forged AS paths in a fast and efficient way. Besides, we utilize heuristic approaches to find common operators’ mistakes such as typos and AS prepending mistakes. The proposed approach classifies our collected ground truth into four categories with 95.71% accuracy. We characterize publicly reported alarms (e.g. BGPMon) with our trained classifier and find 4%, 1%, and 2% of typos, prepend mistakes, and BGP hijacking with a forged AS path, respectively."

     "description": "Network programmers can currently deploy an arbitrary set of protocols in forwarding devices through data plane programming languages such as P4. However, as any other type of software, P4 programs are subject to bugs and misconfigurations. Network verification tools have been proposed as a means of ensuring that the network behaves as expected, but these tools typically require programmers to manually model P4 programs, are limited in terms of the properties they can guarantee and frequently face severe scalability issues. In this paper, we argue for a novel approach to this problem. Rather than statically inspecting a network configuration looking for bugs, we propose to enforce networking properties at runtime. To this end, we developed P4box, a system for deploying runtime monitors in programmable data planes. Our results show that P4box allows programmers to easily express a broad range of properties. Moreover, we demonstrate that runtime monitors represent a small overhead to network devices in terms of latency and resource consumption."

This workshop series provides a forum for researchers, Internet facilities and service providers, technologists, economists, theorists, policy makers, and other stakeholders to exchange views on current and emerging regulatory and policy debates.\r\n\r\nTo try to add clarity to a range of vigorous policy debates, and in pursuit of specific, actionable objectives, for this year's meeting the organizers used a slightly different approach to structuring the agenda. Each attendee chose a specific policy goal or harm, and structured their presentation to answer three questions:\r\n\r\n1. What data is needed to measure progress toward/away from this goal/harm? \r\n2. What methods do you propose to gather such data? \r\n3. Who are the right entities to gather such data, and how should such data be managed and shared? \r\n\r\nWith a specific focus on measurement challenges, the topics we discussed included: analyzing the evolution of the Internet in a layered-platform context to gain new insights; measurement and analysis of economic impacts of new technologies using old tools; security and trustworthiness, reach (universal service) and reachability, sustainability of investment into Internet infrastructure, as well as infrastructure to measure the Internet."

Characterizing small-scale failures of last mile networks is essential to improving Internet reliability. In this paper, we develop and evaluate an approach to detect Internet failure events that affect multiple users simultaneously using measurements from the Thunderping project. Thunderping probes addresses across the U.S. when the areas in which they are geo-located are affected by severe weather alerts. It detects a disruption event when an IP address ceases to respond to pings. In this paper, we focus on simultaneous disruptions of multiple addresses that are related to each other by geography and ISP, and thus are indicative of a shared cause. Using binomial testing, we detect groups of per-IP disruptions that are unlikely to have happened independently. We characterize these dependent disruption events and present results that challenge conventional wisdom on how such outages affect Internet address blocks."

     "description": "Knowledge of the business relationships between Autonomous Systems (ASes) is essential to understanding the behavior of the Internet routing system. Despite significant progress in the development of relationship inference algorithms, the resulting inferences are impractical for many critical real-world applications, cannot offer adequate predictability in the configuration of routing policies, and suffer from inference oscillations. To achieve more practical and stable relationship inference, we first illuminate the root causes of the contradiction between these shortcomings and the near-perfect validation results for AS-Rank, the state-of-the-art relationship inference algorithm. Using a \"naive\" inference approach as a benchmark, we find that available validation datasets over-represent AS links with easier inference requirements. We identify which types of links are harder to infer and develop appropriate validation subsets to enable more representative evaluation.\r\n\r\nWe then develop a probabilistic algorithm, ProbLink, to overcome the challenges in inferring hard links, such as nonvalley-free routing, limited visibility, and non-conventional peering practices. ProbLink reveals key AS-interconnection features derived from stochastically informative signals. Compared to AS-Rank, our approach reduces the error rate for all links by 1.6x and, importantly, by up to 6.1x for various types of hard links. We demonstrate the practical significance of our improvements by evaluating their impact on three applications. Compared to the current state-of-theart, ProbLink increases the precision and recall of route leak detection by 4.1x and 3.4x respectively, reveals 27% more complex relationships, and increases the precision of predicting the impact of selective advertisements by 34%."

     "description": "In this paper, we explore new possibilities, created by programmable switches, for fast rerouting upon signals triggered by Internet traffic disruptions. We present Blink, a data-driven system exploiting TCP-induced signals to detect failures. The key intuition behind Blink is that a TCP flow exhibits a predictable behavior upon disruption: retransmitting the same packet over and over, at epochs exponentially spaced in time. When compounded over multiple flows, this behavior creates a strong and characteristic failure signal. Blink efficiently analyzes TCP flows, at line rate, to: (i) select flows to track; (ii) reliably and quickly detect major traffic disruptions; and (iii) recover data-plane connectivity, via next-hops compatible with the operator’s policies.\r\n\r\nWe present an end-to-end implementation of Blink in P4 together with an extensive evaluation on real and synthetic traffic traces. Our results indicate that Blink: (i) can achieve sub-second rerouting for realistic Internet traffic; (ii) prevents unnecessary traffic shifts, in the presence of noise; and (iii) scales to protect large fractions of realistic Internet traffic, on existing hardware. We further show the feasibility of Blink by running our system on a real Tofino switch."

     "description": "Reproducibility of research in Computer Science (CS) and in the field of networking in particular is a well-recognized problem. For several reasons, including the sensitive and/or proprietary nature of some Internet measurements, the networking research community pays limited attention to the of reproducibility of results, instead tending to accept papers that appear plausible. This article summarises a 2.5 day long Dagstuhl seminar on Encouraging Reproducibility in Scientific Research of the Internet held in October 2018. The seminar discussed challenges to improving reproducibility of scientific Internet research, and developed a set of recommendations that we as a community can undertake to initiate a cultural change toward reproducibility of our work. It brought together people both from academia and industry to set expectations and formulate concrete recommendations for reproducible research. This iteration of the seminar was scoped to computer networking research, although the outcomes are likely relevant for a broader audience from multiple interdisciplinary fields."

     "description": "Autonomous Systems (ASes) can reach hundreds of networks via Internet eXchange Points (IXPs), allowing improvements in traffic delivery performance and competitiveness. Despite the benefits, any pair of ASes needs first to agree on exchanging traffic. By surveying 100\u002b network operators, we discovered that most interconnection agreements are established through ad-hoc and lengthy processes heavily influenced by personal relationships and brand image. As such, ASes prefer long-term agreements at the expense of a potential mismatch between actual delivery performance and current traffic dynamics. ASes also miss interconnection opportunities due to trust reasons. To improve wide-area traffic delivery performance, we propose Dynam-IX, a framework that allows operators to build trust cooperatively and implement traffic engineering policies to exploit the rich interconnection opportunities at IXPs quickly. Dynam-IX offers a protocol to automate the interconnection process, an intent abstraction to express interconnection policies, a legal framework to digitally handle contracts, and a distributed tamper-proof ledger to create trust among ASes. We build and evaluate a Dynam-IX prototype and show that an AS can establish tens of agreements per minute with negligible overhead for ASes and IXPs."

     "description": "BGP prefix hijacking is a critical threat to Internet organizations and users. Despite the availability of several defense approaches (ranging from RPKI to popular third-party services), none of them solves the problem adequately in practice. In fact, they suffer from: (i) lack of detection comprehensiveness, allowing sophisticated attackers to evade detection, (ii) limited accuracy, especially in the case of third-party detection, (iii) delayed verification and mitigation of incidents, reaching up to days, and (iv) lack of privacy and of flexibility in post-hijack counteractions, on the side of network operators. In this work, we propose ARTEMIS (Automatic and Real-Time dEtection and MItigation System), a defense approach (a) based on accurate and fast detection operated by the AS itself, leveraging the pervasiveness of publicly available BGP monitoring services and their recent shift towards real-time streaming, thus (b) enabling flexible and fast mitigation of hijacking events. Compared to previous work, our approach combines characteristics desirable to network operators such as comprehensiveness, accuracy, speed, privacy, and flexibility. Finally, we show through real-world experiments that, with the ARTEMIS approach, prefix hijacking can be neutralized within a minute.\r\n"

     "description": "This work aims at designing and implementing a system able to profile and help manage the set of IXPs in an Internet region. As part of the Internet Society's strategy to help monitor and understand the evolution of IXPs in a particular region, a route-collector data analyzer tool was developed before being deployed and tested in AfriNIC. In fact, traffic localization efforts in the African peering ecosystem would be more sustained and their efficacy assessed if they were supported by a platform, which evaluates and reports in real-time about their impact on the Internet. We thus built the \"African\" Route-collectors Data Analyzer (ARDA), an open source web platform for analyzing publicly available routing information collected since 2005 by local route-collectors. ARDA evaluates pre-defined metrics that picture the status of the interconnection at local, national, and regional levels. It shows that a small proportion of AfriNIC ASes (roughly 17%) are peering in the region. Through them, 58% of all African networks are visible at one IXP or more. These have been static from April to September 2017, and even February 2018, underlining the need for increased efforts to improve local interconnectivity. We show how ARDA can help detect the impact of policies on the growth of local IXPs, or continually provide the community with up-to-date empirical data on the evolution of the IXP substrate. Given its features, this tool will be a helpful compass for stakeholders in the quest for better traffic localization and new interconnection opportunities in the targeted region."

,
     "datePublished": "2018.11",
     "description": "Two complementary approaches to mapping network boundaries from traceroute paths recently emerged. Both approaches apply heuristics to inform inferences extracted from traceroute measurement campaigns. bdrmap used targeted traceroutes from a specific network, alias resolution probing techniques, and AS relationship inferences, to infer the boundaries of that specific network and the other networks attached at each boundary. MAPIT tackled the ambitious challenge of inferring all AS-level network boundaries in a massive archived collection of traceroutes launched from many different networks. Both were substantial contributions to the state-of-the-art, and inspired a collaboration to explore the potential to combine the approaches. We present and evaluate bdrmapIT , the result of that exploration, which yielded a more complete, accurate, and general solution to this persistent and central challenge of Internet topology research. bdrmapIT achieves 91.8%- 98.8% accuracy when mapping AS boundaries in two Internet-wide traceroute datasets, vastly improving on MAP-IT ’s coverage without sacrificing bdrmap ’s ability to map a single network. The bdrmapIT source code is available at https://git.io/fAsI0"

     "description": "It is well known that Internet infrastructure deployment is progressing at a rapid pace in the African continent. A flurry of recent research has quantified this, highlighting the expansion of its underlying connectivity network. However, improving the infrastructure is not useful without appropriately provisioned services to exploit it. This paper measures the availability and utilisation of web infrastructure in Africa. Whereas others have explored web infrastructure in developed regions, we shed light on practices in developing regions. To achieve this, we apply a comprehensive measurement methodology to collect data from a variety of sources. We first focus on Google to reveal that its content infrastructure in Africa is, indeed, expanding. That said, we find that much of its web content is still served from the US and Europe, despite being the most popular website in many African countries. We repeat the same analysis across a number of other regionally popular websites to find that even top African websites prefer to host their content abroad. To explore the reasons for this, we evaluate some of the major bottlenecks facing content delivery networks (CDNs) in Africa. Amongst other factors, we find a lack of peering between the networks hosting our probes, preventing the sharing of CDN servers, as well as poorly configured DNS resolvers. Finally, our mapping of middleboxes in the region reveals that there is a greater presence of transparent proxies in Africa than in Europe or the US. We conclude the work with a number of suggestions for alleviating the issues observed."

Although empirical evidence of blackholing activities are documented in literature, a clear understanding of how blackholing is used in practice when attacks occur is still missing.\r\nThis paper presents a first joint look at DoS attacks and BGP blackholing in the wild. We do this on the basis of two complementary data sets of DoS attacks, inferred from a large network telescope and DoS honeypots, and on a data set of blackholing events. All data sets span a period of three years, thus providing a longitudinal overview of operational deployment of blackholing during DoS attacks."

     "description": "There is significant interest in the technical and policy communities regarding the extent,scope, and consumer harm of persistent interdomain congestion. We provide empirical grounding for discussions of interdomain congestion by developing a system and method to measure congestion on thousands of interdomain links without direct access to them. We implement a system based on the Time Series Latency Probes (TSLP) technique that identifies links with evidence of recurring congestion suggestive of an under-provisioned link. We deploy our system at 86 vantage points worldwide and show that congestion inferred using our lightweight TSLP method correlates with other metrics of interconnection performance impairment. We use our method to study interdomain links of eight large U.S. broadband access providers from March 2016 to December 2017, and validate our inferences against ground-truth traffic statistics from two of the providers. For the period of time over which we gathered measurements, we did not find evidence of widespread endemic congestion on interdomain links between access ISPs and directly connected transit and content providers, although some such links exhibited recurring congestion patterns. We describe limitations, open challenges, and a path toward the use of this method for large-scale third-party monitoring of the Internet interconnection ecosystem."

,
     "datePublished": "2018.8",
     "description": "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are a major threat to the Internet ecosystem. DDoS cannot only exhaust resources of end systems but also of provider uplinks. Ideally, DDoS attacks are mitigated close to the attacker, and mitigation only affects malicious traffic. Mitigation on inter-domain level is commonly implemented with remotely triggered blackholing (RTBH). Blackholing enables the victim domain to mark the (usually /32) IP prefix under attack using BGP communities. Based on this tagging, adjacent peers can filter traffic to the victim to prevent over-load. Although RTBH is an easy to implement, cost-efficient and effective mitigation solution, it faces a significant draw-back: since all traffic to the victim is discarded, the victim becomes completely unreachable. A more fine grained filtering is provided in BGP Flowspec [3], which supports filtering rules – exchanged through BGP – for 12 different components (e.g., source and destination address, TCP flags). In this poster, we aim for a better understanding of DDoS traffic from an inter-domain perspective. We analyze malicious traffic based on passive measurements from a national Internet Service Provider and from a large regional Internet Exchange Point. In contrast to previous work (e.g., [2]), we try to characterize collateral damage that occurs while blackholing DDoS traffic, compared to the benefits of deploying Flowspec. Our ongoing analysis shows that (i) current blackholing drops significant portion of valid traffic whereas BGP Flowspec requires very little additional information to improve the situation, (ii) an IXP is a good vantage point to deploy Flowspec close to the attacker."

,
     "datePublished": "2018.8",
     "description": "Internet connectivity is changing: Autonomous Systems (ASes) can now reach hundreds of networks directly through Internet eXchange Points (IXPs), while reducing latency, and improving traffic delivery performance and competitiveness. Despite these benefits, any pair of ASes needs first to agree on exchanging traffic. Establishing interconnections is mostly a manual and lengthy process that is heavily influenced by personal relationships and brand image. As a result, ASes miss interconnection opportunities and prefer long-term agreements, at the expense of a potential mismatch between actual delivery performance and current Internet traffic dynamics. We posit that IXPs have a large unexplored potential to improve wide-area traffic delivery performance as they offer a rich path diversity that could be leveraged to enable responsiveness to traffic dynamics (e.g., traffic surges, link failures). Facilitating interconnection via IXPs poses two major challenges: (i) How to quickly negotiate an agreement? (ii) How to decide which networks can be trusted to route traffic? To address these challenges, we propose Dynam-IX. Differently from previous academic work and industry initiatives, our approach addresses both aspects while keeping the privacy of the interconnection policies, which is a concern for most network operators."

This workshop series provides a forum for researchers, Internet facilities and service providers, technologists, economists, theorists, policy makers, and other stakeholders to exchange views on current and emerging regulatory and policy debates. The FCC's expected decision (released during the workshop, on 14 December 2017) - to repeal the 2015 classification of broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications (common carrier) service - set the stage for vigorous discussion on what type of data can inform debate, development, and empirical evaluation of public policies we will need for Internet services in the future."

     "description": "There is recent evidence that the core of the Internet, which was formerly dominated by large transit providers, has been reshaped after the transition to a multimedia-oriented network, first by general-purpose CDNs and now by private CDNs. In this work we use k-cores, an element of graph theory, to define which ASes compose the core of the Internet and to track the evolution of the core since 1999. Specifically, we investigate whether large players in the Internet content and CDN ecosystem belong to the core and, if so, since when. We further investigate regional differences in the evolution of large content providers. Finally, we show that the core of the Internet has incorporated an increasing number of content ASes in recent years. To enable reproducibility of this work, we provide a website to allow interactive analysis of our datasets to detect, for example, “up and coming” ASes using customized queries."

,
     "datePublished": "2018.6",
     "description": "Internet measurement tools are used to make inferences about network policies and practices across the Internet, such as censorship, traffic manipulation, bandwidth, and security measures. Some tools must be run from vantage points within individual networks, so are dependent on volunteer recruitment. A small pool of volunteers limits the impact of these tools. Crowdsourcing marketplaces can potentially recruit workers to run tools from networks not covered by the volunteer pool. \r\n\r\nWe design an infrastructure to collect and synchronize measurements from five crowdsourcing platforms, and use that infrastructure to collect data on network source address validation policies for CAIDA's Spoofer project. In six weeks we increased the coverage of Spoofer measurements by recruiting 1519 workers from within 91 countries and 784 unique ASes for 2,000 Euro; 342 of these ASes were not previously covered, and represent a 15% increase in ASes over the prior 12 months. We describe lessons learned in recruiting and remunerating workers; in particular, strategies to address worker behavior when workers are screened because of overlap in the volunteer pool."

     "description": "The current framework of Internet interconnections, based on transit and settlement-free peering relations, has systemic problems that often cause peering disputes. Repeated high-profile incidents show that this unfortunate state of affairs stands in the way of better Internet performance, sometimes even leading to large-scale Internet outages. We propose a new techno-economic interconnection framework called Nash- Peering, which is based on the principles of Nash Bargaining in game theory and economics. Nash-Peering constitutes a radical departure from current interconnection practices, providing a broader and more economically efficient set of interdomain relations. In particular, the direction of payment is not determined by the direction of traffic or by rigid customer-provider relationships but based on which AS benefits more from the interconnection. We argue that Nash-Peering can address the root cause of various types of peering disputes."

,
     "datePublished": "2018.4",
     "description": "Given the increasing scarcity of IPv4 addresses, network operators are resorting to measures to expand their address pool or prolong the life of existing addresses. One such approach is Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN), where many end-users in a network share a single public IPv4 address. There is limited data about the prevalence of CGN, despite the implications on performance, security, and ultimately, the adoption of IPv6. In this work, we present passive measurement-based techniques for detecting CGN deployments across the entire Internet, without the requirement of access to machines behind a CGN. Specifically, we identify patterns in how client IP addresses are observed at MLab servers and at the UCSD network telescope to infer whether those clients are behind a CGN. We apply our methods on data collected from 2014 to 2016. We find that CGN deployment is increasing rapidly. Overall, we infer that 4.1K autonomous systems are deploying CGN, 6 times the number inferred by the most recent studies."

     "datePublished": "2018.3",
     "description": "Internet engineering, science, and public policy communities have significant interest in understanding the extent and scope of, as well as potential consumer harm induced by, persistent interdomain congestion on the Internet. In recent work (Dhamdhere et al., 2018), we developed and implemented a lightweight active measurement method and system to measure evidence of congestion on thousands of interconnection links between broadband access ISPs and major interconnecting parties, including directly connected content providers. This method provides empirical grounding for discussions of interconnection congestion, without requiring direct access to interconnection links. \r\n\r\nWe first review the previous work to provide context. We then present new techniques for visualizing the data in ways we believe are conducive to policy analysis, e.g, of infrastructure resilience, performance metrics, and potential harm to consumers of persistently under-provisioned interconnection links. We present data in ways that allow us to compare different access providers, and show how congestion varies over time. We focus on seven large U.S. broadband access networks, but there is nothing U.S.-specific about the methods we use. Finally, we describe policy-relevant limitations and implications of the work."

     "description": "For the last decade, YouTube has consistently been a dominant source of traffic on the Internet. To improve the quality of experience (QoE) for YouTube users, broadband access providers and Google apply techniques to load balance the extraordinary volume of web requests and traffic. We use traceroute-based measurement methods to infer these techniques for assigning YouTube requests to specific Google video content caches, including the interconnection links between the access providers and Google. We then use a year of measurements (mid2016 to mid-2017) collected from SamKnows probes hosted by broadband customers spanning a major ISP in the U.S. and three ISPs in Europe. We investigate two possible causes of different interdomain link usage behavior. We also compare the YouTube video cache hostnames and IPs observed by the probes, and find that the selection of video cache has little impact on BGP selection of interdomain links."

,
     "datePublished": "2018.1",
     "description": "BGP prefix hijacking is a threat to Internet operators and users. Several mechanisms or modifications to BGP that protect the Internet against it have been proposed. However, the reality is that most operators have not deployed them and are reluctant to do so in the near future. Instead, they rely on basic –and often inefficient– proactive defenses to reduce the impact of hijacking events, or on detection based on third party services and reactive approaches that might take up to several hours. In this work, we present the results of a survey we conducted among 75 network operators to study: (a) the operators’ awareness of BGP prefix hijacking attacks, (b) presently used defenses (if any) against BGP prefix hijacking, (c) the willingness to adopt new defense mechanisms, and (d) reasons that may hinder the deployment of BGP prefix hijacking defenses.We expect the findings of this survey to increase the understanding of existing BGP hijacking defenses and the needs of network operators, as well as contribute towards designing new defense mechanisms that satisfy the requirements of the operators."

     "description": "BGP prefix hijacking is a critical threat to Internet organizations and users. Despite the availability of several defense approaches (ranging from RPKI to popular third-party services), none of them solves the problem adequately in practice. They suffer from: (i) lack of detection comprehensiveness, allowing sophisticated attackers to evade detection, (ii) limited accuracy, especially in the case of third-party detection, (iii) delayed verification and mitigation of incidents, reaching up to days, and (iv) lack of privacy and of flexibility in post-hijack counteractions, from the side of network operators. In this work, we propose ARTEMIS, a defense approach (a) based on accurate and fast detection operated by the AS itself, leveraging the pervasiveness of publicly available BGP monitoring services and their recent shift towards real-time streaming, thus (b) enabling flexible and fast mitigation of hijacking events. Compared to previous work, our approach combines characteristics desirable to network operators such as comprehensiveness, accuracy, speed, privacy, and flexibility. Finally, we show through real-world experiments that, with the ARTEMIS approach, prefix hijacking can be neutralized within a minute."

     "description": "The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) has been used for decades as the de facto protocol to exchange reachability information among networks in the Internet. However, little is known about how this protocol is used to restrict reachability to selected destinations, e.g., that are under attack. While such a feature, BGP blackholing, has been available for some time, we lack a systematic study of its Internet-wide adoption, practices, and network efficacy, as well as the profile of blackholed destinations. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a methodology to automatically detect BGP blackholing activity in the wild. We apply our method to both public and private BGP datasets. We find that hundreds of networks, including large transit providers, as well as about 50 Internet exchange points (IXPs) offer blackholing service to their customers, peers, and members. Between 2014–2017, the number of blackholed prefixes increased by a factor of 6, peaking at 5K concurrently blackholed prefixes by up to 400 Autonomous Systems. We assess the effect of blackholing on the data plane using both targeted active measurements as well as passive datasets, finding that blackholing is indeed highly effective in dropping traffic before it reaches its destination, though it also discards legitimate traffic. We augment our findings with an analysis of the target IP addresses of blackholing. Our tools and insights are relevant for operators considering offering or using BGP blackholing services as well as for researchers studying DDoS mitigation in the Internet."

     "description": "The goal of this work is to investigate the prevalence, causes, and impact of congestion on the African IXP substrate. Towards this end, we deployed Ark probes (within networks peering) at six African IXPs and ran the time-sequence latency probes (TSLP) algorithm, thereby collecting latency measurements to both ends of each mapped AS link for a whole year. We were able to detect congestion events and quantify their periods and magnitudes at four IXPs. We then verified the events and investigated the causes by interviewing the IXP operators. Our results show that only 2.2% of the discovered IP links experienced (sustained or transient) congestion during our measurement period. Our findings suggest the need for ISPs to carefully monitor the provision of their peering links, so as to avoid or quickly mitigate the occurrence of congestion. Regulators may also define the maximum level of packet loss in those links to provide some protection to communications routed through local IXPs."

,
     "datePublished": "2017.11",
     "description": "We revisit the use of crowdsourced throughput measurements to infer and localize congestion on end-to-end paths, with particular focus on points of interconnections between ISPs. We analyze three challenges with this approach. First, accurately identifying which link on the path is congested requires fine-grained network tomography techniques not supported by existing throughput measurement platforms. Coarse-grained network tomography can perform this link identification under certain topological conditions, but we show that these conditions do not always hold on the global Internet. Second, existing measurement platforms provide limited visibility of paths to popular web content sources, and only capture a small fraction of interconnections between ISPs. Third, crowdsourcing measurements inherently risks sample bias: using measurements from volunteers across the Internet leads to uneven distribution of samples across time of day, access link speeds, and home network conditions. Finally, it is not clear how large a drop in throughput to interpret as evidence of congestion. We investigate these challenges in detail, and offer guidelines for deployment of measurement infrastructure, strategies, and technologies that can address empirical gaps in our understanding of congestion on the Internet."

     "description": "Denial-of-Service attacks have rapidly increased in terms of frequency and intensity, steadily becoming one of the biggest threats to Internet stability and reliability. However, a rigorous comprehensive characterization of this phenomenon, and of countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks, faces many infrastructure and analytic challenges. We make progress toward this goal, by introducing and applying a new framework to enable a macroscopic characterization of attacks, attack targets, and DDoS Protection Services (DPSs). Our analysis leverages data from four independent global Internet measurement infrastructures over the last two years: backscatter traffic to a large network telescope; logs from amplification honeypots; a DNS measurement platform covering 60% of the current namespace; and a DNS-based data set focusing on DPS adoption. Our results reveal the massive scale of the DoS problem, including an eye-opening statistic that one-third of all /24 networks recently estimated to be active on the Internet have suffered at least one DoS attack over the last two years. We also discovered that often targets are simultaneously hit by different types of attacks. In our data, Web servers were the most prominent attack target; an average of 3% of the Web sites in .com, .net, and .org were involved with attacks, daily. Finally, we shed light on factors influencing migration to a DPS."

     "datePublished": "2017.11",
     "description": "We develop and validate Internet path measurement techniques to distinguish congestion experienced when a flow self-induces congestion in the path from when a flow is affected by an already congested path. One application of this technique is for speed tests, when the user is affected by congestion either in the last mile or in an interconnect link. This difference is important because in the latter case, the user is constrained by their service plan (i.e., what they are paying for), and in the former case, they are constrained by forces outside of their control. We exploit TCP congestion control dynamics to distinguish these cases for Internet paths that are predominantly TCP traffic. In TCP terms, we re-articulate the question: was a TCP flow bottlenecked by an already congested (possibly interconnect) link, or did it induce congestion in an otherwise idle (possibly a last-mile) link? \r\nTCP congestion control affects the round-trip time (RTT) of packets within the flow (i.e., the flow RTT): an endpoint sends packets at higher throughput, increasing the occupancy of the bottleneck buffer, thereby increasing the RTT of packets in the flow. We show that two simple, statistical metrics derived from the flow RTT during the slow start period—its coefficient of variation, and the normalized difference between the maximum and minimum RTT— can robustly identify which type of congestion the flow encounters. We use extensive controlled experiments to demonstrate that our technique works with up to 90% accuracy. We also evaluate our techniques using two unique real-world datasets of TCP throughput measurements using Measurement Lab data and the Ark platform. We find up to 99% accuracy in detecting self-induced congestion, and up to 85% accuracy in detecting external congestion. Our results can benefit regulators of interconnection markets, content providers trying to improve customer service, and users trying to understand whether poor performance is something they can fix by upgrading their service tier."

     "description": "There is an increasing awareness amongst developing regions on the importance of localizing Internet traffic in the quest for fast, affordable, and available Internet access. In this paper, we focus on Africa, where 37 IXPs are currently interconnecting local ISPs, but mostly at the country level. An option to enrich connectivity on the continent and incentivize content providers to establish presence in the region is to interconnect ISPs present at isolated IXPs by creating a distributed IXP layout spanning the continent. The goal of this paper is to investigate whether such IXP interconnection would be possible, and if successful, to estimate the best-case benefits that could be realized in terms of traffic localization and performance. Our hope is that quantitatively demonstrating the benefits will provide incentives for ISPs to intensify their peering relationships in the region. However, it is challenging to estimate this best-case scenario, due to numerous economic, political, and geographical factors influencing the region. Towards this end, we begin with a thorough analysis of the environment in Africa. We then investigate a naive approach to IXP interconnection, which shows that a theoretically optimal solution would be infeasible in practice due to the prevailing socio-economic conditions in the region. We therefore provide an innovative, realistic four-step interconnection scheme to achieve the distributed IXP layout that considers and parameterizes external socio-economic factors using publicly available datasets. We demonstrate that our constrained solution doubles the percentage of continental intra-African paths, reduces their lengths, and drastically decreases the median of their RTTs as well as RTTs to ASes hosting the top 10 global and top 10 regional Alexa websites. Our approach highlights how, given real-world constraints, a solution requires careful considerations in order to be practically realizable."

     "description": "The right vantage point is critical to the success of any active measurement. However, most research groups cannot afford to design, deploy, and maintain their own network of measurement endpoints, and thus rely measurement infrastructure shared by others. Unfortunately, the mechanism by which we share access to measurement endpoints today is not frictionless; indeed, issues of compatibility, trust, and a lack of incentives get in the way of efficiently sharing measurement infrastructure. We propose PacketLab, a universal measurement endpoint interface that lowers the barriers faced by experimenters and measurement endpoint operators. PacketLab is built on two key ideas: It moves the measurement logic out of the endpoint to a separate experiment control server, making each endpoint a lightweight packet source/sink. At the same time, it provides a way to delegate access to measurement endpoints while retaining fine-grained control over how one’s endpoints are used by others, allowing research groups to share measurement infrastructure with each other with little overhead. By making the endpoint interface simple, we also make it easier to deploy measurement endpoints on any device anywhere, for any period of time the owner chooses. We offer PacketLab as a candidate measurement interface that can accommodate the research community’s demand for future global-scale Internet measurement."

,
     "datePublished": "2017.11",
     "description": "Internet measurement research frequently needs to map infrastructure components, such as routers, to their physical locations. Although public and commercial geolocation services are often used for this purpose, their accuracy when applied to network infrastructure has not been previously assessed. Prior work focused on evaluating the overall accuracy of geolocation databases, which is dominated by their performance on end-user IP addresses. In this work, we evaluate the reliability of router geolocation in databases. We use a dataset of about 1.64M router interface IP addresses extracted from the CAIDA Ark dataset to examine the country- and city-level coverage and consistency of popular public and commercial geolocation databases. We also create and provide a ground-truth dataset of 16,586 router interface addresses and locations, with city-level accuracy, and we use it to evaluate the databases’ accuracy with a regional breakdown analysis. Our results show that the databases are not reliable for geolocating routers and that there is room to improve their country- and city-level accuracy. Based on our results, we present a set of recommendations to researchers concerning using the geolocation databases to geolocate routers."

,
     "datePublished": "2017.10",
     "description": "IPv4 Transfer Markets have recently emerged as a mechanism for prolonging the usability of IPv4 address space. They facilitate the trading of IPv4 address space, which constitutes a radical shift transforming IPv4 addresses from a free resource to a commodity. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of all IPv4 transfers that are published by three regional Internet registries. We analyze the overall evolution of transfer markets, whether they lead to a healthy redistribution of IP addresses, and the interplay between transfers and IPv6 adoption. We find that, to a large extent, IPv4 transfers serve their intended purpose by moving IP blocks from those with excess to those in need - transferred address blocks appear to be routed after the transfer, the utilization of transferred blocks is greater after the transfer date and a high percentage of the transferred space comes from legacy space. We have also proposed a methodology for detecting IPv4 transfers in the wild that tracks changes in origins of IP prefixes in the global routing table. This method yields promising results, yet it produces a large number of false positives due to the noisy nature of routing data. We have investigated the cause of these false positives and verified that they can be reduced to a volume analyzable by a human operator."

,
     "datePublished": "2017.10",
     "description": "In prior work we conducted in 2015, we considered the resilience of deployed TCP implementations to blind in-window RST, SYN, and data attacks. These three attacks and defenses to the attacks were previously described in RFC5961. In this report, we consider the resilience of deployed TCP implementations to blind in-window FIN attacks, an attack not explicitly covered in RFC5961, where an off-path adversary disrupts an established connection by sending a packet that the victim believes came from its peer, causing the connection to be prematurely closed. We extended scamper, a parallelized packet prober with existing TCP behaviour inference capability, to add an active measurement test that infers whether or not a TCP implementation will accept a FIN packet that contains an acknowledgement value that should cause the receiver to discard the packet. We tested operating systems (and middleboxes deployed in front) of 4397 webservers in the wild in September 2017 and found 18% of tested connections were vulnerable to in-window FIN attack packets, consistent with our prior measurements testing the resilience of TCP implementations to blind in-window RST, SYN, and data attacks."

     "description": "We propose and evaluate a new metric for understanding the dependence of the AS-level Internet on individual routers. Whereas prior work uses large volumes of reachability probes to infer outages, we design an efficient active probing technique that directly and unambiguously reveals router restarts. We use our technique to survey 149,560 routers across the Internet for 2.5 years. 59,175 of the surveyed routers (40%) experience at least one reboot, and we quantify the resulting impact of each router outage on global IPv4 and IPv6 BGP reachability. \r\n\r\nOur technique complements existing data and control plane outage analysis methods by providing a causal link from BGP reachability failures to the responsible router(s) and multi-homing configurations. While we found the Internet core to be largely robust, we identified specific routers that were single points of failure for the prefixes they advertised. In total, 2,385 routers – 4.0% of the routers that restarted over the course of 2.5 years of probing – were single points of failure for 3,396 IPv6 prefixes announced by 1,708 ASes. We inferred 59% of these routers were the customer-edge border router. 2,374 (70%) of the withdrawn prefixes were not covered by a less specific prefix, so 1,726 routers (2.9%) of those that restarted were single points of failure for at least one network. However, a covering route did not imply reachability during a router outage, as no previously-responsive address in a withdrawn more specific prefix responded during a one-week sample.We validate our reboot and single point of failure inference techniques with four networks, finding no false positive or false negative reboots, but find some false negatives in our single point of failure inferences."

     "description": "Peering infrastructures, namely, colocation facilities and Internet exchange points, are located in every major city, have hundreds of network members, and support hundreds of thousands of interconnections around the globe. These infrastructures are well provisioned and managed, but outages have to be expected, e.g., due to power failures, human errors, attacks, and natural disasters. However, little is known about the frequency and impact of outages at these critical infrastructures with high peering concentration. \r\nIn this paper, we develop a novel and lightweight methodology for detecting peering infrastructure outages. Our methodology relies on the observation that BGP communities, announced with routing updates, are an excellent and yet unexplored source of information allowing us to pinpoint outage locations with high accuracy. We build and operate a system that can locate the epi- center of infrastructure outages at the level of a building and track the reaction of networks in near real-time. Our analysis unveils four times as many outages as compared to those publicly reported over the past five years. Moreover, we show that such outages have significant impact on remote networks and peering infrastructures. Our study provides a unique view of the Internet’s behavior under stress that often goes unreported."

     "description": "Network operators often face the problem of remote outages in transit networks leading to significant (sometimes on the order of minutes) downtimes. The issue is that BGP, the Internet routing protocol, often converges slowly upon such outages, as large bursts of messages have to be processed and propagated router by router. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present SWIFT, a fast-reroute framework which enables routers to restore connectivity in few seconds upon remote outages. SWIFT is based on two novel techniques. First, SWIFT deals with slow outage notification by predicting the overall extent of a remote failure out of few control-plane (BGP) messages. The key insight is that significant inference speed can be gained at the price of some accuracy. Second, SWIFT introduces a new dataplane encoding scheme, which enables quick and flexible update of the affected forwarding entries. SWIFT is deployable on existing devices, without modifying BGP.\r\n\r\nWe present a complete implementation of SWIFT and demonstrate that it is both fast and accurate. In our experiments with real BGP traces, SWIFT predicts the extent of a remote outage in few seconds with an accuracy of ⇠90% and can restore connectivity for 99% of the affected destinations."

This workshop series provides a forum for researchers, Internet facilities and service providers, technologists, economists, theorists, policy makers, and other stakeholders to inform current and emerging regulatory and policy debates. This year we first returned to the list of aspirations we surveyed at the 2014 workshop, and described the challenges of mapping them to actions and measurable progress. We then reviewed evolutionary shifts in traffic, topology, business, and regulatory models, and (our best understanding of) the economics of the ecosystem. These discussions inspired an extended thought experiment for the second day of the workshop: outlining a new telecommunications legislative framework, including proposing a set of goals and scope of such regulation, and minimal list of sections required to pursue and measure progress toward those goals. The format was a series of focused sessions, where presenters prepared 10-minute talks on relevant issues, followed by in-depth discussions. This report highlights the discussions and presents relevant open research questions identified by participants."

     "description": "Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) mechanisms enable ISPs to share a single IPv4 address across multiple customers, thus offering an immediate solution to the IPv4 address scarcity problem. In this paper, we perform a large scale active measurement campaign to detect CGNs in fixed broadband networks using NAT Revelio – a tool we have developed and validated. Revelio enables us to actively determine from within residential networks the type of upstream network address translation, namely NAT at the home gateway (customer-grade NAT) or NAT in the ISP (Carrier Grade NAT). We demonstrate the generality of the methodology by deploying Revelio in the FCC Measuring Broadband America testbed operated by SamKnows and also in the RIPE Atlas testbed. We enhance Revelio to actively discover from within any home network the type of upstream NAT configuration (i.e., simple home NAT or Carrier Grade NAT). We ran an active large-scale measurement study of CGN usage from 5,121 measurement vantage points within over 60 different ISPs operating in Europe and the United States. We found that 10% of the ISPs we tested have some form of CGN deployment. We validate our results with four ISPs at the IP level and, reported to the ground truth we collected, we conclude that Revelio was 100% accurate in determining the upstream NAT configuration for all the corresponding lines. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the largest active measurement study of (confirmed) CGN deployments at the IP level in fixed broadband networks to date."

     "description": "Despite source IP address spoofing being a known vulnerability for at least 25 years, and despite many efforts to shed light on the problem, spoofing remains a popular attack method for redirection, amplification, and anonymity. To defeat these attacks requires operators to ensure their networks filter packets with spoofed source IP addresses, known as source address validation (SAV), best deployed at the edge of the network where traffic originates. In this paper, we present a new method using routing loops appearing in traceroute data to infer inadequate SAV at the transit provider edge, where a provider does not filter traffic that should not have come from the customer. Our method does not require a vantage point within the customer network. We present and validate an algorithm that identifies at Internet scale which loops imply a lack of ingress filtering by providers. We found 703 provider ASes that do not implement ingress filtering on at least one of their links for 1,780 customer ASes. Most of these observations are unique compared to the existing methods of the Spoofer and Open Resolver projects. By increasing the visibility of the networks that allow spoofing, we aim to strengthen the incentives for the adoption of SAV."

     "description": "The Internet has become a critical platform for economic, political, cultural, and social activity. The technology behind the Internet continues to evolve, with ramifications for not only the technologies that govern network and application functions, but also for social, economic, and legal concerns. Internet protocols impact not only the basic performance and reliability of Internet services, but also impact debates about fairness issues in content delivery, free speech, trust and cybersecurity, privacy and intellectual property, and control over content.\r\n\r\nThis article discusses a proposed future Internet architecture that changes how data is delivered over the Internet. Named Data Networking (NDN) is a prominent example within the broader research field of information-centric networking (ICN). We cannot fully predict how changing protocols will change policy outcomes: social impacts of technology are caused by an interdependent mix of technological decisions, user decisions, and social and policy contexts. But if we take seriously the notion that running code shapes rights, behavior, and governance, then analyzing how NDN would alter that code—the technical infrastructure we rely on every day—is an important challenge.\r\n\r\nThis article addresses this challenge by beginning a conversation about the social impacts of NDN, with a particular focus on content producers and consumers. We describe the building blocks of NDN; its request-response data exchange is inspired by the Web, but functions at a more fundamental level in the protocol stack. NDN uses data names for routing and forwarding, provides per-packet data signatures, and leverages in-network storage.a We provide a scenario to illustrate the interactions of these building blocks and describe how the proposed changes could expand options for free speech, security, privacy, and anonymity, while raising new challenges regarding data retention and forgetting. We will address impacts for governments and content industries caused by changing the way networked data is identified, handled, and routed as well as examine how these changes raise new challenges and possibilities for ensuring neutrality across public networks. Taken together, this anticipatory analysis suggests research questions and areas of technical focus for ongoing NDN research, and helps us better understand the potential consequences of information-centric networking."

     "description": "Applications often use IP addresses as end host identifiers based on the assumption that IP addresses do not change frequently, even when dynamically assigned. The validity of this assumption depends upon the duration of time that an IP address continues to be assigned to the same end host, and this duration in turn, depends upon the various causes that can induce the currently assigned IP address to change. In this work, we identify different causes that can lead to an address change and analyze their effect in ISPs around the world using data gathered from 3,038 RIPE Atlas probes hosted across 929 ASes and 156 countries across all 12 months of 2015. Our observations reveal information about ISP practices, outages, and dynamic address prefixes. For example, we found 20 ISPs around the world that periodically reassign addresses after a fixed period, typically a multiple of 24 hours. We also found that address changes are correlated with network and power outages occurring at customer premises equipment (CPE) devices. Furthermore, almost half of the address changes we observed on the same CPE were to an entirely different BGP-routed prefix."

Although BGP is a crucial operational component of the Internet infrastructure, and is the subject of research in the areas of Internet performance, security, topology, protocols, economics, etc., there is no efficient way of processing large amounts of distributed and/or live BGP measurement data. BGPStream fills this gap, enabling efficient investigation of events, rapid prototyping, and building complex tools large-scale monitoring applications (e.g., detection of connectivity disruptions or BGP hijacking attacks). We discuss the goals and architecture of BGPStream. We apply the components of the framework to different scenarios, and we describe the development and deployment of complex services for global Internet monitoring that we built on top of it."

     "description": "We review the methodological challenges in the state-of-the-art capabilities for real-time inference of paths that packets travel across the Internet, at the granularity of network service providers, i.e., autonomous system, or ASes. AS path inferences based on control-plane (BGP) data lead to inaccuracies, so researchers have attempted to use traceroute-based inferences to mitigate these inaccuracies, although without a formal framework for doing so. In this work, we improve the state-of-the-art technology for inferring AS paths traversed by traceroute probes in three ways: (i) we introduce a framework to systematically evaluate when different approaches lead to wrong inferences; (ii) we present a methodology that by combining previous and novel inference heuristics yields better accuracy; (iii) we implement in a software tool this methodology and two other methodologies for comparative evaluation. We describe the process we used to construct AS-level paths, the set of heuristics we use to evaluate them, and the tool in which we implemented these heuristics. A more comprehensive evaluation and refinement of these heuristics is future work; we report on the current state of one of the most daunting unresolved measurement challenges on the Internet."

     "description": "We tackle the tedious and unsolved problem of automatically and correctly inferring network boundaries in traceroute. We explain why such a conceptually simple task is so hard in the real world, and how lack of progress has impeded a wide range of research and development efforts for decades. We develop and validate a method that uses targeted traceroutes, knowledge of traceroute idiosyncrasies, and codification of topological constraints in a structured set of heuristics, to correctly identify interdomain links at the granularity of individual border routers. In this study we focus on the network boundaries we have most confidence we can accurately infer in the presence of sampling bias: interdomain links attached to the network launching the traceroute. We develop a scalable implementation of our algorithm and validate it against ground truth information provided by four networks on 3,277 links, which showed 96.3% - 98.9% of our inferences were correct.\r\n\r\nWith 19 vantage points (VPs) distributed across a large U.S. broadband provider, we use our method to reveal the tremendous density of router-level interconnection between some ASes. In January 2016, the broad- band provider had 45 router-level links with a Tier-1 peer. We also quantify the VP deployment required to observe this ISP's interdomain connectivity, with 17 VPs required to observe all 45 links. Our method forms the cornerstone of the system we are building to map interdomain performance, and we release our code."

     "description": "The limitations of a BGP-inferred AS-level topology are generally understood, but the impact of various types of missing links on various topology properties and characteristics remains an open question. As part of CAIDA's continuing work to improve the completeness, accuracy, and richness of the measured AS-level Internet graphs, we developed a methodology to combine different types of data into a comprehensive (\"combined\") Internet topology. \r\n\r\nOur methodology has three steps: deriving a base graph from AS paths observed in publicly available BGP by breaking AS paths into AS links; augmenting this base graph with traceroute-derived inferred AS links (corresponding to only the first AS hop in the traceroute, for methodological reasons); and extracting AS level topology data from multilateral peering registration information in European Internet eXchange Point (IXP) route server data. Specifically, we examined how the introduction of 241,459 additional peering links (a 136% increase over the BGP graph) and 144 additional nodes (0.3% increase) inferred from traceroute and Internet eXchange (IX) data changed the topological properties of the ASlevel graph originally derived from the BGP data. Notably, only 6.8% of the ASes in the original BGP-based graph gained additional links. Of those ASes, links were primarily added to medium degree ASes, and ASes classified as edge ASes remained largely unaffected. For all four metrics we used to define the peripheral part of the graphs (customer cone, coreness, eccentricity, node betweenness), the change of the relative size of this part was 3% or less between the BGP-based and the combined graphs. One of the primary insights of this exercise is that for the largest and smallest degree ASes, BGP measurements capture connectivity characteristics well, but for many middle-degree ASes, additional connectivity not visible in global BGP data repositories is revealed by traceroute-based inferences."

     "description": "Interconnection links connecting access providers to their peers, transit providers and major content providers are a potential point of discriminatory treatment and impairment of user experience. In the U.S., the FCC has asserted regulatory authority over those links, although they have acknowledged they lack sufficient expertise to develop appropriate regulations thus far. Without a basis of knowledge that relates measurement to justified inferences about actual impairment, different actors can put forward opportunistic interpretations of data to support their points of view. \r\n\r\nWe introduce a topology-aware model of interconnection, to add clarity to a recent proliferation of data and claims, and to elucidate our own beliefs about how to measure interconnection links of access providers, and how policymakers should interpret the results. We use six case studies that span data sets offered by access providers, edge providers, academic researchers, and one mandated by the FCC. This last example reflects our recent experience as the Independent Measurement Experts that worked with the FCC and AT\u0026T in establishing a measurement methodology for reporting on the state of AT\u0026T’s interconnection links. These case studies show how our conceptual model can guide a critical analysis of what is or should be measured and reported, and how to soundly interpret these measurements. We conclude with insights gained in the process of defining the AT\u0026T/DirecTV methodology and in the process of defining and applying our conceptual model."

In this document, we elaborate on the reasoning and motivation behind the measurement methodology we have specified. A paragraph from the merger order provides context for our task:\r\n\r\n\u003e Discussion. As stated in the 2015 Open Internet Order, “consumers bear the harm when they experience degraded access to the applications and services of their choosing due to a dispute between a large broadband provider and an interconnecting party.” Also, because OVD subscribers expect high-quality video, OVDs are vulnerable to degradation at the interconnection point with a broadband Internet access service provider’s last mile network. Thus, as stated in the 2015 Open Internet Order, we find that “broadband Internet access providers have the ability to use terms of interconnection to disadvantage edge providers and that consumers’ ability to respond to unjust or unreasonable broadband provider practices are limited by switching costs.” We appreciate commenters’ concerns in this area."

The research and operations communities have developed a set of tools and data sources for understanding and experimenting with BGP, and on February 2016 we organized the first BGP Hackathon, themed around live measurement and monitoring of Internet routing. The Hackathon included students, researchers, operators, providers, policymakers, and funding agencies, working together on projects to measure, visualize, and improve routing or the tools we use to study routing. This report describes the tools used at the Hackathon and presents an overview of the projects. The Hackathon was a success, and we look forward to future iterations."

     "description": "We revisit thirty-five years of history related to the design of Quality of Service (QoS) on the Internet, hoping to offer some clarity to current debates around service differentiation. We describe the continual failure to get QoS capabilities deployed on the public Internet, including the technical challenges of the 1980s and 1990s, the business challenges of the 1990s and 2000s, and recent regulatory challenges. In short, while the standards community developed protocols to support enhanced services (QoS), service providers have only deployed them in intranet scenarios where they can internalize costs and benefits, rather than across fiscally distinct organizational boundaries. We examine lessons learned from this failure to deploy interdomain QoS, the resulting tensions and risks, and their regulatory implications."

This workshop series provides a forum for researchers, Internet facilities and service providers, technologists, economists, theorists, policy makers, and other stakeholders to inform current and emerging regulatory and policy debates.\r\n\r\nThe FCC’s latest open Internet order ostensibly changes the landscape of regulation by using Title II as its basis. This year we discussed the implications of Title II (common- carrier-based) regulation for issues we have looked at in the past, or those shaping current policy conversations. Discussion topics included differentiated services on the public Internet, evolving approaches to interconnection across different segments of the ecosystem (e.g., content to access), QoE and QoS measurement techniques and their limitations, interconnection measurement and modeling challenges and opportunities, and transparency. The format was a series of focused sessions, where presenters prepared 10-minute talks on relevant issues, followed by in-depth discussions. This report highlights the discussions and presents relevant open research questions identified by participants."

     "description": "One challenge in understanding the evolution of the Internet infrastructure is the lack of systematic mechanisms for monitoring the extent to which allocated IP addresses are actually used. In this paper we advance the science of inferring IPv4 address space utilization by proposing a novel taxonomy and analyzing and correlating results obtained through different types of measurements. We have previously studied an approach based on passive measurements that can reveal used portions of the address space unseen by active approaches. In this paper, we study such passive approaches in detail, extending our methodology to new types of vantage points and identifying traffic components that most significantly contribute to discovering used IPv4 network blocks. We then combine the results we obtained through passive measurements together with data from active measurement studies, as well as measurements from BGP and additional datasets available to researchers. Through the analysis of this large collection of heterogeneous datasets, we substantially improve the state of the art in terms of: (i) understanding the challenges and opportunities in using passive and active techniques to study address utilization; and (ii) knowledge of the utilization of the IPv4 space."

     "description": "End-to-end IPv6 performance is a factor that can influence IPv6 adoption. The stability of IPv6 – both in the control and data plane – is an important determinant of end-to-end performance, as it influences packet loss, network latency, and hence application performance. In this paper we compare stability and performance measurements from the control and data plane in IPv6 and IPv4. To study control plane stability, we use BGP feeds from five dual-stacked vantage points to measure routing dynamics towards IPv4 and IPv6 destinations. To study data plane stability, we probe dual-stacked webservers in 629 target ASes to determine the availability, RTT performance and RTT stability of paths toward these targets. In both control and data plane experiments IPv6 exhibited less stability than IPv4. In the control plane, most routing dynamics were generated by a small fraction of pathological unstable prefixes. In the data-plane, episodes of unavailability were longer on IPv6 than on IPv4. We found evidence of correlated performance degradation over IPv4 and IPv6 caused by shared infrastructure."

Since NAT444 solutions may impair performance for some users, understanding the extent of NAT444 deployment in the Internet is of interest to policymakers, ISPs, and users. We perform an initial validation of the NAT Revelio test suite within a controlled NAT444 trial environment involving operational residential lines managed by a large operator in the UK. We leverage access to a unique SamKnows deployment in the UK and collect information about the existence of NAT444 solutions from 2,000 homes and 26 ISPs. To demonstrate the flexibility of NAT Revelio, we also deployed it in project BISmark, an open platform for home broadband internet research. We analyze the results and discuss our findings."

,
     "datePublished": "2016.3",
     "description": "Network operators measure Internet routes to troubleshoot problems, and researchers measure routes to characterize the Internet. However, they still rely on decades-old tools like traceroute, BGP route collectors, and Looking Glasses, all of which permit only a single query about Internet routes—what is the path from here to there? This limited interface complicates answering queries about routes such as “find routes traversing the Level3/AT\u0026T peering in Atlanta,” to understand the scope of a reported problem there.\r\n\r\nThis paper presents Sibyl, a system that takes rich queries that researchers and operators express as regular expressions, then issues and returns traceroutes that match even if it has never measured a matching path in the past. Sibyl achieves this goal in three steps. First, to maximize its coverage of Internet routing, Sibyl integrates together diverse sets of traceroute vantage points that provide complementary views, measuring from thousands of networks in total. Second, because users may not know which measurements will traverse paths of interest, and because vantage point resource constraints keep Sibyl from tracing to all destinations from all sources, Sibyl uses historical measurements to predict which new ones are likely to match a query. Finally, based on these predictions, Sibyl optimizes across concurrent queries to decide which measurements to issue given resource constraints. We show that Sibyl provides researchers and operators with the routing information they need--in fact, it matches 76% of the queries that it could match if an oracle told it which measurements to issue."

     "description": "Looking glasses (LG) servers enhance our visibility into Internet connectivity and performance by offering a set of distributed vantage points that allow both data plane and control plane measurements. However, the lack of input and output standardization and limitations in querying frequency have hindered the development of automated measurement tools that would allow systematic use of LGs. In this paper we introduce Periscope, a publicly-accessible overlay that unifies LGs into a single platform and automates the discovery and use of LG capabilities. The system architecture combines crowd-sourced and cloud-hosted querying mechanisms to automate and scale the available querying resources. Periscope can handle large bursts of requests, with an intelligent controller coordinating multiple concurrent user queries without violating the various LG querying rate limitations. As of December 2015 Periscope has automatically extracted 1,691 LG nodes in 297 Autonomous Systems. We show that Periscope significantly extends our view of Internet topology obtained through RIPE Atlas and CAIDA's Ark, while the combination of traceroute and BGP measurements allows more sophisticated measurement studies."

,
     "datePublished": "2016.2",
     "description": "There is growing operational awareness of the challenges in securely operating IPv6 networks. Through a measurement study of 520,000 dual-stack servers and 25,000 dual-stack routers, we examine the extent to which security policy codified in IPv4 has also been deployed in IPv6. We find several high-value target applications with a comparatively open security policy in IPv6 including: (i) SSH, Telnet, SNMP, are more than twice as open on routers in IPv6 as they are in IPv4; (ii) nearly half of routers with BGP open were only open in IPv6; and (iii) in the server dataset, SNMP was twice as open in IPv6 as in IPv4. We conduct a detailed study of where port blocking policy is being applied and find that protocol openness discrepancies are consistent within network boundaries, suggesting a systemic failure in organizations to deploy consistent security policy. We successfully communicate our findings with twelve network operators and all twelve confirm that the relative openness was unintentional. Ten of the twelve immediately moved to deploy a congruent IPv6 security policy, reflecting real operational concern. Finally, we revisit the belief that the security impact of this comparative openness in IPv6 is mitigated by the infeasibility of IPv6 network-wide scanning—we find that, for both of our datasets, host addressing practices make discovering these high-value hosts feasible by scanning alone. To help operators accurately measure their own IPv6 security posture, we make our probing system publicly available."

,
     "datePublished": "2016.2",
     "description": "This paper presents a network security laboratory project for teaching network traffic anomaly detection methods to electrical engineering students. The project design follows a research-oriented teaching principle, enabling students to make their own discoveries in real network traffic, using data captured from a large IP darkspace monitor operated at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Although darkspace traffic does not include bidirectional conversations (only attempts to initiate them), it contains traffic related to or actually perpetrating a variety of network attacks originating from millions of Internet addresses around the world. This breadth of coverage makes this darkspace data an excellent choice for a hands-on study of Internet attack detection techniques. In addition, darkspace data is less privacy-critical than other network traces, because it contains only unwanted network traffic and no legitimate communication. In the lab exercises presented, students learn about network security challenges, search for suspicious anomalies in network traffic, and gain experience in presenting and interpreting their own findings. They acquire not only security-specific technical skills but also general knowledge in statistical data analysis and data mining techniques. They are also encouraged to discover new phenomena in the data, which helps to ignite their general interest in science and engineering research. The Vienna University of Technology, Austria, first implemented this laboratory during the summer semester 2014, with a class of 41 students. With the help of the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) at UCSD, all exercises and IP darkspace data are publicly available."

As mobile networks become the predominant method of Internet access, developer, research, network operator, and regulatory communities have taken an increased interest in measuring end-to-end mobile network performance to, among other goals, minimize negative impact on application responsiveness. In this survey, we examine current approaches to end-to-end mobile network performance measurement, diagnosis, and application prototyping. We compare available tools and their shortcomings with respect to the needs of developers, researchers, network operators, and regulators. We intend for this survey to provide a comprehensive view of currently active efforts and some auspicious directions for future work in mobile network measurement and mobile application performance evaluation."

     "description": "Annotating Internet interconnections with robust physical coordinates at the level of a building facilitates network management including interdomain troubleshooting, but also has practical value for helping to locate points of attacks, congestion, or instability on the Internet. But, like most other aspects of Internet interconnection, its geophysical locus is generally not public; the facility used for a given link must be inferred to construct a macroscopic map of peering. We develop a methodology, called constrained facility search, to infer the physical interconnection facility where an interconnection occurs among all possible candidates. We rely on publicly available data about the presence of networks at different facilities, and execute traceroute measurements from more than 8,500 available measurement servers scattered around the world to identify the technical approach used to establish an interconnection. A key insight of our method is that inference of the technical approach for an interconnection sufficiently constrains the number of candidate facilities such that it is often possible to identify the specific facility where a given interconnection occurs. Validation via private communication with operators confirms the accuracy of our method, which outperforms heuristics based on naming schemes and IP geolocation. Our study also reveals the multiple roles that routers play at interconnection facilities; in many cases the same router implements both private interconnections and public peerings, in some cases via multiple Internet exchange points. Our study also sheds light on peering engineering strategies used by different types of networks around the globe."

     "description": "While the performance characteristics of access networks and end-user-to-server paths are well-studied, measuring the performance of the Internet's _core_ remains, largely, an uncharted territory. With more content being moved closer to the end-user, server-to-server paths have increased in length and have a significant role in dictating the quality of services offered by content and service providers. In this paper, we present a large-scale study of the effects of _routing_ changes and _congestion_ on the end-to-end latencies of server-to-server paths in the core of the Internet. \r\n\r\nWe exploit the distributed platform of a large content delivery network, composed of thousands of servers around the globe, to assess the performance characteristics of the Internet’s core. We conduct measurement campaigns between thousands of server pairs, in both forward and reverse directions, and analyze the performance characteristics of server-to-server paths over both long durations (months) and short durations (hours). Our analyses show that there is a large variation in the frequency of routing changes. While routing changes typically have marginal or no impact on the end-to-end round-trip times (RTTs), 20% of them impact IPv4 (IPv6) paths by at least 26 ms (31 ms). We highlight how dual-stack servers can be utilized to reduce server-to-server latencies by up to 50 ms. Our results indicate that significant daily oscillations in end-to-end RTTs of server-to-server paths is not the norm, but does occur, and, in most cases, contributes about a 20 ms increase in server-to-server path latencies."

     "description": "Data transfer is one of the main functions of the Internet. The Internet consists of a large number of interconnected subnetworks or domains, known as Autonomous Systems (ASes). Due to privacy and other reasons the information about what route to use to reach devices within other ASes is not readily available to any given AS. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is responsible for discovering and distributing this reachability information to all ASes. Since the topology of the Internet is highly dynamic, all ASes constantly exchange and update this reachability information in small chunks, known as routing control packets or BGP updates. In the view of the quick growth of the Internet there are significant concerns with the scalability of the BGP updates and the efficiency of the BGP routing in general. Motivated by these issues we conduct a systematic time series analysis of BGP update rates. We find that BGP update time series are extremely volatile, exhibit long-term correlations and memory effects, similar to seismic time series, or temperature and stock market price fluctuations. The presented statistical characterization of BGP update dynamics could serve as a basis for validation of existing and developing better models of Internet interdomain routing."

,
     "datePublished": "2015.10",
     "description": "We have developed a method to localize and quantify interdomain congestion in the Internet. Our Time Sequence Latency Probes (TSLP) method depends on two facts: Internet traffic patterns are typically diurnal, and queues increase packet delay through a router during periods of adjacent link congestion. Repeated round trip delay measurements from a single test point to the two edges of a congested link will show sustained increased latency to the far (but not to the near) side of the link. We are designing and implementing a system for network-wide measurement of congestion using the TSLP method. We plan to support QoE measurements on this system to complement our measurement of QoS metrics such as delay and loss rate."

     "description": "As part of TCP’s steady evolution, recent standards have recommended mechanisms to protect against weaknesses in TCP. But adoption, configuration, and deployment of TCP improvements can be slow. In this work, we consider the resilience of deployed TCP implementations to blind in-window attacks, where an off-path adversary disrupts an established connection by sending a packet that the victim believes came from its peer, causing data corruption or connection reset. We tested operating systems (and middleboxes deployed in front) of webservers in the wild in September 2015 and found 22% of connections vulnerable to in-window SYN and reset packets, 30% vulnerable to in-window data packets, and 38.4% vulnerable to at least one of three in-window attacks we tested. We also tested out-of-window packets and found that while few deployed systems were vulnerable to reset and SYN packets, 5.4% of connections accepted in-window data with an invalid acknowledgment number. In addition to evaluating commodity TCP stacks, we found vulnerabilities in 12 of 14 of the routers and switches we characterized – critical network infrastructure where the potential impact of any TCP vulnerabilities is particularly acute. This surprisingly high level of extant vulnerabilities in the most mature Internet transport protocol in use today is a perfect illustration of the Internet’s fragility. Embedded in historical context, it also provides a strong case for more systematic, scientific, and longitudinal measurement and quantitative analysis of fundamental properties of critical Internet infrastructure, as well as for the importance of better mechanisms to get best security practices deployed."

     "description": "Quality of Experience (QoE) is a measure of whether a use of the Internet meets the needs and (“reasonable”) expectations of the user and provider in the context of any specific application. But QoE is a subjective measure of quality. While quality of service (QOS) is used to describe the technical parameters of any service (peak speed, latency, jitter, packet loss), assessment of QoE is application-specific. Impairments to QoE derive in part from underlying QoS parameters (e.g., jitter impairs voice QoE but not email), and can arise anywhere in the network. \r\n\r\nCAIDA and MIT have demonstrated a research method that can detect such congestion at points of interconnection, and found that business contention (usually well- reported in the press) correlates with evidence of substantial persistent congestion at points of interconnection – some episodes have persisted for days or months. Our current research method focuses on measuring persistent rather than instantaneous congestion, but with instrumentation and refinement of such methods, the research community could develop tools that they, the consumer or the FCC could use to gather evidence on whether jitter is arising at points of interconnection or elsewhere in the network."

     "description": "For more than a decade, unsolicited traffic sent to unused regions of the address space has provided valuable insight into malicious Internet activities. In this paper, we explore the utility of this traffic, known as Internet Background Radiation (IBR), for a different purpose: as a data source of Internet-wide measurements. We collect and analyze IBR from two large darknets, carefully deconstructing its various components and characterizing them along dimensions applicable to Internet-wide measurements. Intuitively, IBR can provide insight into network properties when traffic from that network contains relevant information and is of sufficient volume. We turn this intuition into a scientific investigation, examining which networks send IBR, identifying components of IBR that enable opportunistic network inferences, and characterizing the frequency and granularity of traffic sources. We also consider the influences of time of collection and position in the address space on our results. We leverage IBR properties in three case studies to show that IBR can supplement existing techniques by improving coverage and/or diversity of analyzable networks while reducing measurement overhead. Our main contribution is a new framework for understanding the circumstances and properties for which unsolicited traffic is an appropriate data source for inference of macroscopic Internet properties, which can help other researchers assess its utility for a given study."

Although BGP is a crucial operational component of the Internet infrastructure, and is the subject of research in the areas of Internet performance, security, topology, protocols, economics, etc., there is no standard and efficient way of processing large amounts of distributed and/or live BGP measurement data. BGPStream fills this gap, enabling efficient investigation of events, rapid prototyping, and building complex tools and efficient large-scale monitoring applications (e.g., detection of connectivity disruptions or BGP hijacking attacks). We discuss the design choices and challenges in the development of BGPStream. We apply the components of the framework to different scenarios, and we describe the development and deployment of complex services for global Internet monitoring that we built on top of it."

     "description": "Ensuring a healthy ecosystem for broadband services is critical to securing the future of a healthy and open Internet. From the perspective of social welfare maximization, this means collective management of the decision-making regarding how we design, operate, provide access to, use, and pay for our broadband access networks. Realizing this collective goal requires balancing the interests of multiple market participants that are often in conflict and evolve in light of changing technical, business, and policy conditions.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of markets and regulatory interventions depends on whether decision-makers at all market levels are appropriately informed. This requires the selective sharing of information. Consumers need information about their broadband access options in order to make informed decisions about which (if any) broadband services to subscribe to, how to use those services, and what investments to make in complementary assets (devices, content, applications). Providers of content, applications, and other complementary goods and services need to know about broadband access options to appropriately position their offerings in the market. And, regulators need information about broadband access options to design and enforce policies that will promote competition and ensure appropriate market choices exist.\r\n\r\nAll of these stakeholders need information about broadband service availability, pricing, performance, and to the extent discernible, about trends and plans that will shape future options. Furthermore, broadband access service providers either already possess or may more easily obtain a great deal of the information needed by market participants. However, the information sharing challenges are far from simple. Different stakeholders need different information, information is costly to collect and share, and to the extent it impacts market outcomes, has strategic value. For example, better informed consumers might be more inclined to switch providers, thereby intensifying price competition; while better informed regulators may be better able to limit supra-competitive profit opportunities. Additionally, sharing of too much information about the performance of specific broadband connections might threaten subscriber privacy or render broadband networks more vulnerable to attack.\r\n\r\nDisclosure and Transparency (D\u0026T) policies comprise a toolset of rules, processes, and mechanisms that are used by market participants to help structure and manage the flow of information that is needed for informed decision-making. D\u0026T policies comprise a significant component of the regulatory provisions in the FCC's 2015 OIO, which sets forth the FCC's approach for regulating providers of broadband access services. The focus of this paper is on providing a framework with which to interpret the OIO's D\u0026T provisions within the larger market context. The OIO's specific D\u0026T provisions are just one component of the tools and mechanisms that shape how broadband management relevant information is discovered, shared, and interpreted. Other regulatory provisions in the OIO and other market mechanisms such as performance testing platforms interact with the explicit D\u0026T provisions that mandate specific obligations and responsibilities. As we shall explain, the richness of D\u0026T tools is desirable in order to address the complex and diverse questions that arise in the context of broadband management requiring information sharing. Moreover, understanding how these D\u0026T policy tools interact and complement (or substitute) for each other is helpful if these tools are to be appropriately applied and appreciated. Application of these tools should be nuanced and evolvable to incentivize cooperation and voluntary disclosure by the ISPs while also safeguarding the interests of end users and intermediaries in the broadband Internet ecosystem.\r\n\r\nIn Section 2, we review the specific D\u0026T provisions in the FCC's 2015 OIO and situate these within the larger D\u0026T policy framework. We introduce a meta-tool, the D\u0026T Coordinator, to assist in better understanding the landscape of potential interventions and with which to contrast the relative merits of different interventions in different contexts.\r\n\r\nIn Section 3, we apply our framework to divergent prototypical examples of the sorts of questions that confront the challenge of how to best manage broadband networks. At one end, we have what appears to be the narrow and specific question of crafting an appropriate set of D\u0026T policies to ensure adequate reporting of packet loss by ISPs. At the other extreme, we consider open-ended questions that relate to society's aspirations or goals for what the Internet and broadband services should be. We argue that an assortment of D\u0026T tools are needed for the array of questions confronting broadband stakeholders, but with different emphasis, because the contexts within which they arise engage both specific and general, closed and open-ended details to be addressed appropriately.\r\n\r\nSection 4 offers our concluding summary and directions for future work."

     "description": "One challenge in understanding the evolution of Internet infrastructure is the lack of systematic mechanisms for monitoring the extent to which allocated IP addresses are actually used. In this paper we try to advance the science of inferring IPv4 address space utilization by proposing a novel taxonomy and analyzing and correlating results obtained through different types of measurements. We have previously studied an approach based on passive measurements that can reveal used portions of the address space unseen by active approaches. In this paper, we study such passive approaches in detail, extending our methodology to new types of vantage points, identifying traffic components that most significantly contribute to discovering used IPv4 network blocks. We then combine the results we obtained through passive measurements together with data from active measurement studies, as well as measurements from BGP and additional datasets available to researchers. Through the analysis of this large collection of heterogeneous datasets, we substantially improve the state of the art in terms of: (i) understanding the challenges and opportunities in using passive and active techniques to study address utilization; and (ii) knowledge of the utilization of the IPv4 space."

,
     "datePublished": "2015.9",
     "description": "We revisit the last 35 years of history related to the design and specification of Quality of Service (QoS) on the Internet, in hopes of offering some clarity to the current debates around service differentiation. We describe the continual failure to get QoS capabilities deployed on the public Internet, including the technical challenges of the 1980s and 1990s, the market-oriented (business) challenges of the 1990s and 2000s, and recent regulatory challenges. Our historical perspective draws on, among other things, our own work from the 1990s that offered proposals for supporting enhanced services using the Internet Protocol (IP) suite, and our attempts to engage both industry and policymakers in understanding the dynamics of the Internet ecosystem. In short, the engineering community successfully developed protocols and mechanisms to implement enhanced services (QoS), and a few individual service providers have deployed them internally or in trusted two-party scenarios. The long-standing failure has been to deploy this capability across the public Internet.\r\n\r\nWe reflect on lessons learned from the history of this failure, the resulting tensions and risks, and their implications for the future of Internet infrastructure regulation. First, the continued failure of QoS over the last three decades derives from political and economic (business) obstacles as well as technical obstacles. The competitive nature of the industry, and a long history of anti-trust regulation (at least in the U.S.) conflicts with the need for competing providers to agree on protocols that require sharing operational data with each other to parameterize and verify committed service qualities. Second, QoS technology can yield benefits as well as harms, so policymaking should focus on harms rather than mechanisms. To assure the benefit to consumers, regulators may need to require transparency about the state of congestion and provisioning on networks using such mechanisms. Third, using QoE as the basis for any regulation will require research, tools and capabilities to measure, quantify, and characterize QoE, and developing metrics of service quality that better reflect our understanding of QoS and QoE for a range of applications. Finally, profound shifts in interconnection arrangements suggest a reshaping of the debate over QoS on the public Internet. Some access networks are interconnecting their private IP-based network platforms to support enhanced services, and using this interconnected platform to vertically integrate infrastructure and applications. Access networks are also connecting directly to large content providers to minimize the risk of performance impairments. These changes trigger new regulatory concerns over the fate of the public Internet, including capital investment incentives and gaps across different bodies of law.\r\n\r\nBarriers to the deployment of scalable interprovider QoS may be unsurmountable, but since any Internet of the future will face them, it is worth developing a systematic understanding to the challenge of enhanced services, and documenting successes and failures over the history of the Internet as carefully as possible."

     "description": "Securing communication in network applications involves many complex tasks that can be daunting even for security experts. The Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture builds data authentication into the network layer by requiring all applications to sign and authenticate every data packet. To make this authentication usable, the decision about which keys can sign which data and the procedure of signature verification need to be automated. This paper explores the ability of NDN to enable such automation through the use of trust schemas. Trust schemas can provide data consumers an automatic way to discover which keys to use to authenticate individual data packets, and provide data producers an automatic decision process about which keys to use to sign data packets and, if keys are missing, how to create keys while ensuring that they are used only within a narrowly defined scope (\"the least privilege principle\"). We have developed a set of trust schemas for several prototype NDN applications with different trust models of varying complexity. Our experience suggests that this approach has the potential of being generally applicable to a wide range of NDN applications."

     "description": "Conducting sound measurement studies of the global Internet is inherently difficult. The collected data significantly depends on vantage point(s), sampling strategies, security policies, or measurement populations -- and conclusions drawn from the data can be sensitive to these biases. Crowdsourcing is a promising approach to address these challenges, although the epistemological implications have not yet received substantial attention by the research community. We share our findings from leveraging Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) system for three distinct network measurement tasks. We describe our failure to outsource to MTurk an execution of a security measurement tool, our subsequent successful integration of a simple yet meaningful measurement within a HIT, and finally the successful use of MTurk to quickly provide focused small sample sets that could not be obtained easily via alternate means. Finally, we discuss the implications of our experiences for other crowdsourced measurement research."

     "description": "Systematic monitoring of performance characteristics of mobile broadband networks can help users, operators, and regulators understand this increasingly critical infrastructure. We report the results of a measurement study of round trip delays in two mobile networks in Norway using over 200 geographically distributed subscriptions for a period of one month. In general, we find high variation in delay within the same radio access type and RRC state. Across both networks we study, we observe connections with round trip delays of several seconds, often multiple times per hour, that are more frequent when nodes are moving. Correlating these extreme delay events with available metadata, we find they are related to handovers, radio state transitions, and retransmissions at the link and physical layers."

     "datePublished": "2015.8",
     "description": "We introduce and explore a method for inferring hidden geometric coordinates of nodes in complex networks based on the number of common neighbors between the nodes. We compare this approach to the HyperMap method, which is based only on the connections (and disconnections) between the nodes, i.e., on the links that the nodes have (or do not have). We find that for high degree nodes, the common-neighbors approach yields a more accurate inference than the link-based method, unless heuristic periodic adjustments (or “correction steps”) are used in the latter. The common-neighbors approach is computationally intensive, requiring O(t4) running time to map a network of t nodes, versus O(t3) in the link-based method. But we also develop a hybrid method with O(t3) running time, which combines the common-neighbors and link-based approaches, and we explore a heuristic that reduces its running time further to O(t2), without significant reduction in the mapping accuracy. We apply this method to the autonomous systems (ASs) Internet, and we reveal how soft communities of ASs evolve over time in the similarity space. We further demonstrate the method's predictive power by forecasting future links between ASs. Taken altogether, our results advance our understanding of how to efficiently and accurately map real networks to their latent geometric spaces, which is an important necessary step toward understanding the laws that govern the dynamics of nodes in these spaces, and the fine-grained dynamics of network connections."

,
     "datePublished": "2015.8",
     "description": "The daunting pace of innovation in the information and communications technology (ICT) landscape, a landscape of technology and business structure, is a well-known but under-appreciated reality. In contrast, the rate of  policy and regulatory innovation is much slower, partly due to its inherently more deliberative character. We describe this disparity in terms of the natural rates of change in different parts of the ecosystem, and examine why it has impeded attempts to impose effective regulation on the telecommunications industry. We explain why a recent movement to reduce this disparity by increasing the pace of regulation - adaptive regulation - faces five obstacles that may hinder its feasibility in the ICT ecosystem. As a means to achieve more sustainable regulatory frameworks for ICT industries, we introduce an approach based on finding stable points in the system architecture. We explore the origin and role of these stable points in a rapidly evolving system, and argue that they can provide a means to support development of policies, including adaptive regulation approaches, that are more likely to survive the rapid pace of evolution in technology.\r\n"

     "description": "On December 10-11 2014, we hosted the 4th interdisciplinary Workshop on Internet Economics (WIE) at the UC San Diego’s Supercomputer Center. This workshop series provides a forum for researchers, Internet facilities and service providers, technologists, economists, theorists, policy makers, and other stakeholders to inform current and emerging regulatory and policy debates. The objective for this year’s workshop was a structured consideration of whether and how policy-makers should try to shape the future of the Internet. To structure the discussion about policy, we began the workshop with a list of potential aspirations for our future telecommunications infrastructure (a list we had previously collated), and asked participants to articulate an aspiration or fear they had about the future of the Internet, which we summarized and discussed on the second day. The focus on aspirations was motivated by the high-level observation that before discussing regulation, we must agree on the objective of the regulation, and why the intended outcome is justified. In parallel, we used a similar format as in previous years: a series of focused sessions, where 3-4 presenters each prepared 10-minute talks on issues in recent regulatory discourse, followed by in-depth discussions. This report highlights the discussions and presents relevant open research questions identified by participants. Slides presented and a copy of this report are available at https://www.caida.org/workshops/wie/1412/."

     "description": "The RFI asks \"What innovative, transformational technologies have the potential to enhance the security, reliability, resiliency, and trustworthiness of the digital infrastructure, and to protect consumer privacy?\"\r\n\r\nWe believe that it would be beneficial to reframe and broaden the scope of this question. The security problems that we face today are not new, and do not persist because of a lack of a technical breakthrough. Rather, they arise in large part in the larger context within which the technology sits, a space defined by misaligned economic incentives that exacerbate coordination problems, lack of clear leadership, regulatory and legal barriers, and the intrinsic complications of a globally connected ecosystem with radically distributed ownership of constituent parts of the infrastructure. Worse, although the public and private sectors have both made enormous investments in cybersecurity technologies over the last decade, we lack relevant data that can characterize the nature and extent of specific cybersecurity problems, or assess the effectiveness of technological or other measures intended to address them.\r\n\r\nWe first examine two inherently disconnected views of cybersecurity, the correct-operation view and the harm view. These two views do not always align. Attacks on specific components, while disrupting correct operation, may not map to a specific and quantifiable harm. Classes of harms do not always derive from a specific attack on a component; there may be many stages of attack activity that result in harm. Technologists tend to think about assuring correct operation while users, businesses, and policy makers tend to think about preventing classes of harms. Discussions of public policy including research and development funding strategies must bridge this gap.\r\n\r\nWe then provide two case studies to illustrate our point, and emphasize the importance of developing ways to measure the return on federal investment in cybersecurity R\u0026D."

Recent research on network geometry has shown that those real networks can be adequately modeled as random geometric graphs in hyperbolic spaces. In this paper, we present a computer program to generate such graphs. Besides realworld-like networks, the program can generate random graphs from other well-known graph ensembles, such as the soft configuration model, random geometric graphs on a circle, or Erdős–Rényi random graphs. The simulations show a good match between the expected values of different network structural properties and the corresponding empirical values measured in generated graphs, confirming the accurate behavior of the program."

,
     "datePublished": "2015.4",
     "description": "Peering in the Internet interdomain network has long been considered a \"black art\", understood in-depth only by a select few peering experts while the majority of the network operator community only scratches the surface employing conventional rules-of-thumb to form peering links through ad hoc personal interactions. Why is peering considered a black art? What are the main sources of complexity in identifying potential peers, negotiating a stable peering relationship, and utility optimization through peering? How do contemporary operational practices approach these problems? In this work we address these questions for Tier-2 Network Service Providers. We identify and explore three major sources of complexity in peering: (a) inability to predict traffic flows prior to link formation (b) inability to predict economic utility owing to a complex transit and peering pricing structure (c) computational infeasibility of identifying the optimal set of peers because of the network structure. We show that framing optimal peer selection as a formal optimization problem and solving it is rendered infeasible by the nature of these problems. Our results for traffic complexity show that 15% NSPs lose some fraction of customer traffic after peering. Additionally, our results for economic complexity show that 15% NSPs lose utility after peering, approximately, 50% NSPs end up with higher cumulative costs with peering than transit only, and only 10% NSPs get paid-peering customers."

,
     "datePublished": "2015.4",
     "description": "With the 20th anniversary of IPv6 nearing quickly, a growing number of Internet service providers (ISPs) now offer their customers both IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity. This makes multi-homing with IPv4 and IPv6 increasingly common even with just a single ISP connection. Furthermore, the growing popularity of multi-path transport, especially Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) that is the extension of the well-known Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), leads to the question of whether this identity duality can be utilized for improving application performance in addition to providing resilience. In this paper, we first investigate the AS-level congruency of IPv4 and IPv6 paths in the Internet. We find that more than 60% of the current IPv4 and IPv6 AS-paths are non-congruent at the AS-level, which motivates us to explore how MPTCP can utilize the IPv4/IPv6 identity duality to improve data transfer performance. Our results show that MPTCP, even with a single dual-stack Internet connection, can significantly improve the end-to-end performance when the underlying paths are noncongruent. The extent of the improvement can reach up to the aggregate of the IPv4 and IPv6 bandwidths."

We catalog these aspirations in order to subject them to critical analysis, and motivate a debate over which of them are desirable, well-specified, realistic and achievable. Our list of aspirations is not original to us, nor do we agree with all of them. We have tried to collate what others have said, so we can consider it all at once."

     "description": "Internet scanning is a de facto background traffic noise that is not clear if it poses a dangerous threat, i.e., what happens to scanned hosts? what is the success rate of scanning? and whether the problem is worth investing significant effort and money on mitigating it, e.g., by filtering unwanted traffic? In this work we take a first look into Internet scanning from the point of view of scan repliers using a unique combination of data sets which allows us to estimate how many hosts replied to scanners and whether they were subsequently attacked in an actual network. To contain our analysis, we focus on a specific interesting scanning event that was orchestrated by the Sality botnet during February 2011 which scanned the entire IPv4 address space. By analyzing unsampled NetFlow records, we show that 2% of the scanned hosts actually replied to the scanners. Moreover, by correlating scan replies with IDS alerts from the same network, we show that significant exploitation activity followed towards the repliers, which eventually led to an estimated 8% of compromised repliers. These observations suggest that Internet scanning is dangerous: in our university network, at least 142 scanned hosts were eventually compromised. World-wide, the number of hosts that were compromised in response to the studied event is likely much larger."

     "description": "Botnets are the most common vehicle of cyber-criminal activity. They are used for spamming, phishing, denial of service\r\nattacks, brute-force cracking, stealing private information, and cyber warfare. Botnets carry out network scans for several\r\nreasons, including searching for vulnerable machines to infect and recruit into the botnet, probing networks for enumeration or penetration, etc. We present the measurement and analysis of a horizontal scan of the entire IPv4 address space conducted by the Sality botnet in February 2011. This 12-day scan originated from approximately 3 million distinct IP addresses, and used a heavily coordinated and unusually covert scanning strategy to try to discover and compromise VoIP-related (SIP server) infrastructure. \r\n\r\nWe observed this event through the UCSD Network Telescope, a /8 darknet continuously receiving large amounts of unsolicited traffic, and we correlate this traffic data with other public sources of data to validate our inferences. Sality is one of the largest botnets ever identified by researchers, its behavior represents ominous advances in the evolution of modern malware: the use of more sophisticated stealth scanning strategies by millions of coordinated bots, targeting critical\r\nvoice communications infrastructure. This work offers a detailed dissection of the botnet‛s scanning behavior, including general methods to correlate, visualize, and extrapolate botnet behavior across the global Internet."

     "description": "We consider the problem of inferring IPv6 router uninterrupted system availability, or *uptime*, from a remote vantage point with-out privileged access. Uptime inference is important to broader efforts to measure and characterize the availability of critical infrastructure, provides insight into network operations, and has subtle security implications. Our approach utilizes active probes to periodically elicit IPv6 fragment identifiers from IPv6 router interfaces, and analyzes the resulting identifier time series for reboots. We demonstrate the approach‛s potential by characterizing 21,539 distinct IPv6 router interfaces over a five-month period. We find evidence of clustered reboot events, popular maintenance windows, and correlation with globally visible control plane data. Our results, validated by five ASes, provide initial insight into the current state of IPv6 router availability."

     "description": "There is increasing evidence that IPv6 deployment is maturing as a response to the exhaustion of unallocated IPv4 address blocks, leading to gradual convergence of the IPv4 and IPv6 topologies in terms of structure and routing paths. However, the lack of a fully-connected\r\ntransit-free clique in IPv6, as well as a different economic evolution than IPv4, implies that existing IPv4 AS relationship algorithms will not accurately infer relationships between autonomous systems in IPv6, encumbering our ability to model and understand IPv6 AS topology evolution. We modify CAIDA‛s IPv4 relationship inference algorithm to accurately infer IPv6 relationships using publicly available BGP data. We validate 24.9% of our 41,589 c2p and p2p inferences for July 2014 to have a 99.3% and 94.5% PPV, respectively. Using these inferred relationships, we analyze the BGP-observed IPv4 and IPv6 AS topologies, and find that ASes are converging toward the same relationship types in IPv4 and IPv6, but disparities remain due to differences in the transit-free clique and the influence of Hurricane Electric in IPv6."

     "description": "Recent years have shown a promising progress in understanding geometric underpinnings behind the structure, function, and dynamics of many complex networks in nature and society. However, these promises cannot be readily fulfilled and lead to important practical applications, without a simple, reliable, and fast network mapping method to infer the latent geometric coordinates of nodes in a real network. Here, we present _HyperMap_, a simple method to map a given real network to its hyperbolic space. The method utilizes a recent geometric theory of complex networks modeled as random geometric graphs in hyperbolic spaces. The method replays the network's geometric growth, estimating at each time-step the hyperbolic coordinates of new nodes in a growing network by maximizing the likelihood of the network snapshot in the model. We apply HyperMap to the Autonomous Systems (AS) Internet and find that: 1) the method produces meaningful results, identifying soft communities of ASes belonging to the same geographic region; 2) the method has a remarkable predictive power: Using the resulting map, we can predict missing links in the Internet with high precision, outperforming popular existing methods; and 3) the resulting map is highly navigable, meaning that a vast majority of greedy geometric routing paths are successful and low-stretch. Even though the method is not without limitations, and is open for improvement, it occupies a unique attractive position in the space of tradeoffs between simplicity, accuracy, and computational complexity."

,
     "datePublished": "2015.2",
     "description": "With research using data available online, researcher conduct is not fully prescribed or proscribed by formal ethical codes of conduct or law because of ill-fitting \"expectations signals\" — indicators of legal and ethical risk. This article describes where these ordering forces breakdown in the context of online research and suggests how to identify and respond to these grey areas by applying common legal and ethical tenets that run across evolving models. It is intended to advance the collective dialogue work-in-progress toward a path that revisits and harmonizes more appropriate ethical and legal signals for research using online data between and among researchers, oversight entities, policymakers and society."

     "description": "In the first months of 2011, Internet communications were disrupted in several North African countries in response to civilian protests and threats of civil war. In this paper we analyze episodes of these disruptions in two countries: Egypt and Libya. Our analysis relies on multiple sources of large-scale data already available to academic researchers: BGP interdomain routing control plane data; unsolicited data plane traffic to unassigned address space; active macroscopic traceroute measurements; RIR delegation files; and MaxMind's geolocation database. We used the latter two data sets to determine which IP address ranges were allocated to entities within each country, and then mapped these IP addresses of interest to BGP-announced address ranges (prefixes) and origin ASes using publicly available BGP data repositories in the U.S. and Europe. We then analyzed observable activity related to these sets of prefixes and ASes throughout the censorship episodes. Using both control plane and data plane data sets in combination allowed us to narrow down which forms of Internet access disruption were implemented in a given region over time. Among other insights, we detected what we believe were Libya's attempts to test firewall-based blocking before they executed more aggressive BGP-based disconnection. Our methodology could be used, and automated, to detect outages or similar macroscopically disruptive events in other geographic or topological regions."

     "datePublished": "2014.12",
     "description": "Network tarpits, whereby a single host or appliance can masquerade as many fake hosts on a network and slow network scanners, are a form of defensive cyber-deception. In this work, we develop degreaser, an efficient fingerprinting tool to remotely detect tarpits. In addition to validating our tool in a controlled environment, we use degreaser to perform an Internet-wide scan. We discover tarpits of non-trivial size in the wild (prefixes as large as /16), and characterize their distribution and behavior. We then show how tarpits pollute existing network measurement surveys that are tarpit-naive, e.g. Internet census data, and how degreaser can improve the accuracy of such surveys. Lastly, our findings suggest several ways in which to advance the realism of current network tarpits, thereby raising the bar on tarpits as an operational security mechanism."

,
     "datePublished": "2014.11",
     "description": "The traditional approach of modeling relationships between ASes abstracts relationship types into three broad categories: transit, peering, and sibling. More complicated configurations exist, and understanding them may advance our knowledge of Internet economics and improve models of routing. We use BGP, traceroute, and geolocation data to extend CAIDA's AS relationship inference algorithm to infer two types of complex relationships: hybrid relationships, where two ASes have different relationships at different interconnection points, and partial transit relationships, which restrict the scope of a customer relationship to the provider's peers and customers. Using this new algorithm, we find 4.5% of the 90,272 provider-customer relationships observed in March 2014 were complex, including 1,071 hybrid relationships and 2,955 partial-transit relationships. Because most peering relationships are invisible, we believe these numbers are lower bounds. We used feedback from operators, and relationships encoded in BGP communities and RPSL, to validate 20% and 6.9% of our partial transit and hybrid inferences, respectively, and found our inferences have 92.9% and 97.0% positive predictive values. Hybrid  relationships are not only established between large transit providers; in  57% of the inferred hybrid transit/peering relationships the customer had a customer cone of fewer than 5 ASes."

As mobile networks become the predominant method of Internet access, research, development, and regulatory communities have taken an increased interest in measuring mobile network performance and its impact on user experience. In this survey we examine current approaches to end-to-end mobile network performance measurement, diagnosis, and application prototyping. We compare available tools and their shortcomings with respect to the needs of researchers, developers, regulators, and the public. We intend for this survey to provide a comprehensive view of currently active efforts and some auspicious directions for future work in mobile network measurement and mobile application performance evaluation."

     "description": "We introduce and demonstrate the utility of a method to localize and quantify inter-domain congestion in the Internet. Our Time Sequence Latency Probes (TSLP) method depends on two facts: Internet traffic patterns are typically diurnal, and queues increase packet delay through a router during periods of adjacent link congestion. Repeated round trip delay measurements from a single test point to the two edges of a congested link will show sustained increased latency to the far (but not to the near) side of the link, a delay pattern that differs from the typical diurnal pattern of an uncongested link. We describe our technique and its surprising potential, carefully analyze the biggest challenge with the methodology (interdomain router-level topology inference), describe other less severe challenges, and present initial results that are sufficiently promising to motivate further attention to overcoming the challenges."

     "description": "One challenge in understanding the evolution of Internet infrastructure is the lack of systematic mechanisms for monitoring the extent to which allocated IP addresses are actually used. In this paper we try to advance the science of inferring IPv4 address space utilization by analyzing and correlating results obtained through different types of measurements. We have previously studied an approach based on passive measurements that can reveal used portions of the address space unseen by active approaches. In this paper, we study such passive approaches in detail, extending our methodology to four different types of vantage points, identifying traffic components that most significantly contribute to discovering used IPv4 network blocks. We then combine the results we obtained through passive measurements together with data from active measurement studies, as well as measurements from BGP and additional datasets available to researchers. Through the analysis of this large collection of heterogeneous datasets, we substantially improve the state of the art in terms of: (i) understanding the challenges and opportunities in using passive and active techniques to study address utilization; and (ii) knowledge of the utilization of the IPv4 space."

     "description": "On 26-27 March 2014, CAIDA hosted the sixth Workshop on Active Internet Measurements (AIMS-6) as part of our series of Internet Statistics and Metrics Analysis (ISMA) workshops. As with previous AIMS workshops, the goals were to further our understanding of the potential and limitations of active measurement research and infrastructure in the wide-area Internet, and to promote cooperative solutions and coordinated strategies between academics, industry, policymakers, and funding agencies in the area of active Internet measurement. This year, we explored capabilities and opportunities for network measurement in the wireless domain, and research infrastructure to support it. Participants found the workshop content challengingly diverse, with substantial knowledge exchange regarding the wireless research infrastructure landscape(s) and existing measurement capabilities. But attendees agreed that the conversation was only beginning, and that some challenges merit further discussion, such as finding consensus on standard metrics to measure, and constructing a road map for wireless measurement research infrastructure and activities for the next decade. This report describes topics discussed at the workshop, and summarizes participants' views of priorities for future funding as well as follow-on workshops in this area. \r\n\r\nMaterials related to the workshop are available at [https://www.caida.org/workshops/aims/1403/](https://www.caida.org/workshops/aims/1403/)."

     "description": "Embedded in a challenging legal and historical context, the FCC must act in the short term to address concerns about harmful discriminatory behavior. But its actions should be consistent with an effective, long-term approach that might ultimately reflect a change in legal framing and authority. In this comment we do not express a preference among short-term options, e.g., section 706 vs. Title II. Instead we suggest steps that would support any short-term option chosen by the FCC, but also inform debate about longer term policy options. Our suggestions are informed by recent research on Internet connectivity structure and performance, from technical as well as business perspectives, and our motivation is enabling fact-based policy. Our line of reasoning is as follows.\r\n\r\n1) Recent discourse about Internet regulation has focused on whether or how to regulate discrimination rather than on its possible harms and benefits. For four reasons, we advocate explicit attention to possible harms, their causes, and means to prevent them. First, the court has stated that while the FCC cannot ban traffic discrimination unless it reclassifies Internet access providers under Title II, the FCC does have the authority  to remedy harms. Second, a focus on harms provides a possible way to govern specialized services, which are currently not subject to traffic management constraints. Third, if the FCC chooses Title II, it will open up many  questions about which parts to enforce, which will require a discussion of the harms vs. benefits of selective forbearance. Fourth, any new regulatory framework would be well-served by a thorough understanding of potential harms and benefits that result from behavior of various actors.\r\n\r\n2) Impaired quality of experience (QoE) is a meaningful indicator of harm, essential to effective regulatory analysis focused on harms, but not well-understood. Unfortunately, tools to measure and analyze QoE today are primitive, which is a key obstacle to using it as part of a sound basis for regulation. The FCC should promote research, tools and capabilities to measure, quantify, and characterize QoE, and explore metrics of service quality that better reflect our understanding of QoS and QoE for a range of applications. \r\n\r\n3) Interconnection is not separable from discrimination when evaluating harmful behavior, since interconnection practices can induce harms \r\nthat do not materially differ from those induced by discrimination. Different modes of connection raise different potential harms, and an overall analysis of such harms can suggest reasonable constraints on ISP and edge provider behavior.\r\n\r\n4) One such constraint is that to the extent that terminating monopoly ISPs are under no obligation to peer, they should have to provide uncongested interconnection (peering and transit) links. However, this approach requires cognizance of the distinction between small edge providers (\"congestion-takers\") and large edge providers (\"congestion-makers\"). That is, large edge providers who can send enough traffic volume to induce congestion, must responsibly manage their traffic sources and negotiate in good faith for direct interconnection or other solutions where appropriate, so that ISPs can reasonably fulfill their obligation.\r\n\r\n5) A longer-term challenge is to create a regulatory framework that promotes improvements in infrastructure performance, robustness, and security while also promoting freedom and innovation in a highly  dynamic ecosystem. An examination of the Internet ecosystem from an industrial platform perspective can  help scope consistent policy discourse, in particular around specialized services, and anchor a framework that balances these aspirations.\r\n\r\n6) A regulatory requirement for transparent consideration of harms and benefits will support any direction the FCC chooses This requirement brings four challenges: ensuring such analyses are sufficiently detailed to allow independent, third-party evaluation; obtaining independent evaluations from objective parties; adapting to changing reasonable expectations about QoE over time; and capturing specific as well as more general societal harms, such as the effects of under-investment in capacity."

     "description": "The dynamic nature of the telecommunications industry, with its rapidly changing technology and industry structure, presents a serious challenge to the theory and practice of regulation, which has a slower response time and a tendency to embed assumptions about technology and industry into regulation. This paper proposes a model that attempts to capture two durable and persistent features of today's telecommunications ecosystem: the use of layered platforms to implement desired functionality; and interconnection between actors at different platform layers.  We use platform theory, and in particular theories of multi-sided platforms (MSPs), to focus on key technical and business aspects of today's industry. We use an MSP-aware layered model of the ecosystem to explore several recent and impending innovations in the ecosystem that have been naively conflated with the global Internet, illuminate their differences, and describe how regulators could use our model to more rigorously consider them. To illustrate its potential as a baseline for future research, we briefly consider how this model can help scope consistent policy discourse   of   three   policy   challenges:   specialized   services,   minimum   quality regulations (\"the dirt road\" problem), and structural separation.\r\n"

     "description": "This paper examines the nature of congestion in the interior of the Internet: its location and its intensity. We present results of a new method for probing the Internet which allows us to detect the presence of congestion on specific links. We are particularly interested in the links that interconnect ISPs, including what are called peering links. There is little data on the extent of congestion across interconnection links, leaving users to wonder if peering links are properly engineered, or whether they are a major source of problems transferring data across the Internet.\r\n\r\nQuestions about congestion are an important part of the current debates about reasonable network management. Our results suggest that peering connections are properly provisioned in the majority of cases, and the locations of major congestion are associated with specific sources of high-volume flows, specifically from the Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and dominant content providers such as Netflix and Google. We see variation in the congestion patterns among these different sources that suggests differences in business relationships among them. We argue that a major goal for the industry is to work out methods of cooperation among different ISPs and higher-level services (who may be competitors in the market) so as to jointly achieve cost-effective delivery of data with maximum quality of service and quality of experience. We discuss some of the problems that must be addressed in this coordination exercise, as well as some of the barriers.\r\n\r\n"

     "description": "Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of five projects funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation under its Future Internet Architecture Program. NDN has its roots in an earlier project, Content-Centric Networking (CCN), which Van Jacobson first publicly presented in 2006. The NDN project investigates Jacobson's proposed evolution from today's host-centric network architecture (IP) to a data-centric network architecture (NDN). This conceptually simple shift has far-reaching implications for how we design, develop, deploy, and use networks and applications. We describe the motivation and vision of this new architecture, and its basic components and operations. We also provide a snapshot of its current design, development status, and research challenges. More information about the project, including prototype implementations, publications, and annual reports, is available on named-data.net."

,
     "datePublished": "2014.7",
     "description": "Researchers depend on public BGP data to understand the structure and evolution of the AS topology, as well as the operational security and resiliency of BGP. BGP data is provided voluntarily by network operators who establish BGP sessions with route collectors that record this data. In this paper, we show how trivial it is for a single vantage point (VP) to introduce thousands of spurious routes into the collection by providing examples of five VPs that did so. We explore the impact these misbehaving VPs had on AS relationship inference, showing these misbehaving VPs introduced thousands of AS links that did not exist, and caused relationship inferences for links that did exist to be corrupted. We evaluate methods to automatically identify misbehaving VPs, although we find the result unsatisfying because the limitations of real-world BGP practices and AS relationship inference algorithms produce signatures similar to those created by misbehaving VPs. The most recent misbehaving VP we discovered added thousands of spurious routes for nine consecutive months until 8 November 2012. This misbehaving VP barely impacts (0.1%) our validation of our AS relationship inferences, but this number may be misleading since most of our validation data relies on BGP and RPSL which validates only existing links, rather than asserting the non-existence of links. We have only a few assertions of non-existent routes, all received via our public-facing website that allows operators to provide validation data through our interactive feedback mechanism.  We only discovered this misbehavior because two independent operators corrected some inferences, and we noticed\r\nthat the spurious routes all came from the same VP. This event highlights the limitations of even the best available topology data, and provides additional evidence that comprehensive ground truth validation from operators is essential to scientific research on Internet topology."

     "description": "Determining the physical locations of Internet routers is crucial for characterizing Internet infrastructure and understanding geographic pathways of global routing, as well as for creating Point-of-Presence (POP) level maps. These tasks require good router geolocations.  Yet current commercial geolocation efforts focus predominantly on geolocating clients and servers, that is, edge hosts rather than routers in the core of the network. In this paper we focus on geolocating Internet routers, using a methodology for extracting and decoding geography-related strings from fully qualified domain names (hostnames). We first compiled an extensive dictionary associating geographic strings (e.g., airport codes) with geophysical locations. We then searched a large set of router hostnames for these strings, assuming each autonomous naming domain uses geographic hints consistently within that domain. We used topology and performance data continually collected by our global measurement\r\ninfrastructure to ascertain whether a given hint appears to co-locate different hostnames in which it is found. Finally, generalized  geolocation hints into domain-specific rule sets. We generated a total of 1,711 rules covering 1,398 different domains and validated them using domain-specific ground truth we gathered for six domains. Unlike previous efforts which relied on labor-intensive domain-specific manual analysis, our process for inferring the domain specific heuristics is automated, representing a measurable advance in the state-of-the-art of methods for geolocating Internet resources."

     "datePublished": "2014.4",
     "description": "This paper explores the potential social impacts of Named Data Networking (NDN), a proposed future Internet architecture that forwards packets based on data names rather than host addresses. We highlight four departures from today's TCP/IP architecture, which underscore the social impacts of NDN: the architecture's emphases on enabling semantic classification, provenance, publication, and decentralized communication. While all of these principles can be implemented in the current Internet‛s application layer, NDN enables them at the network layer, and thus encourages all applications to comport with them. We describe how these changes from TCP/IP will expand affordances for free speech, and produce positive outcomes for security, privacy and anonymity while raising new challenges regarding data retention and forgetting. We describe how these changes might alter current corporate and law enforcement content regulation mechanisms by changing the way data is identified, handled, and routed across the Web. We examine how even as NDN empowers edges with more decentralized communication options, by providing more context per packet than IP, it raises new challenges in ensuring neutrality across the public network. Finally, we introduce openings where telecommunications policy can evolve alongside NDN to ensure an open, fair Internet. "

     "datePublished": "2014.4",
     "description": "Peering agreements between Autonomous Systems affect not only the flow of interdomain traffic but also the economics of the entire Internet ecosystem. The conventional wisdom is that transit providers are selective in choosing their settlement-free peers because they prefer to offer revenue-generating transit service to others. Surprisingly, however, a large percentage of transit providers use an Open peering strategy. What causes this large-scale adoption of Open peering, especially among transit providers? More importantly, what is the impact of this peering trend on the economic performance of the population of transit providers? We approach these questions through game-theoretic modeling and agent-based simulations, capturing the dynamics of peering strategy adoption, inter-network formation and interdomain traffic flow. We explain why transit providers gravitate towards Open peering even though that move may be detrimental \r\nto their economic fitness. Finally, we examine the impact of an Open peering variant that requires some coordination among providers. "

     "description": "In this study we mine one of the few sources of public data available about the interdomain peering ecosytem: PeeringDB, an online database where participating networks contribute information about their peering policies, traffic volumes and presence at various geographic locations. Although established to support the practical needs of operators, this data also provides a valuable source of information to researchers. Using BGP data to cross-validate three years of PeeringDB snapshots, we find that PeeringDB membership is reasonably representative of the Internet‛s transit, content, and access providers in terms of business types and geography of participants, and PeeringDB data is generally up-to-date. We find strong correlations among different measures of network size - BGP-advertised address space, PeeringDB-reported traffic volume and presence at peering facilities, and between these size measures and advertised peering policies.

     "name": "A Second Look at Detecting Third-Party Addresses in Traceroute Traces with the IP Timestamp Option"
,
     "datePublished": "2014.3",
     "description": "Artifacts in traceroute measurement output can lead to false inferences of AS-level links and paths when used to deduce AS topology. One traceroute artifact is caused by routers that respond to traceroute probes with a source address not in the path towards the destination, i.e. an off-path address. The most well-known traceroute artifact, the third-party address, is caused by off-path addresses that map to ASes not in the corresponding BGP path. In PAM 2013, Marchetta et al. proposed a technique to detect off-path addresses in traceroute paths.\r\nTheir technique assumed that a router IP address reported in a traceroute path towards a destination was off-path if, in a subsequent probe towards the same destination, the router did not insert a timestamp into a pre-specified timestamp option in the probe‛s IP header. However, no standard precisely defines how routers should handle the pre-specified timestamp option, and implementations are inconsistent. Marchetta et al. claimed that most IP addresses in a traceroute path are off-path, and that consecutive off-path addresses are common. They reported no\r\nvalidation of their results. We cross-validate their approach with a first-principles approach, rooted in the assumption that subnets between connected routers are often /30 or /31 because routers are often connected with point-to-point links. We infer if an address in a traceroute path corresponds to the interface on a router that received the packet (the inbound interface) by attempting to infer if its /30 or /31 subnet mate is an alias of the previous hop. We traceroute from 8 Ark monitors to 80K randomly chosen destinations, and find that most observed addresses are configured on the in-bound interface on a point-to-point link connecting two routers, i.e. are on-path. Because the technique from reports 70.9%—74.9% of these addresses as being off-path, we conclude it is not reliable at inferring which addresses are off-path or third-party. "

In this article, we describe Traffic Identification Engine (TIE), an open source tool for network traffic classification, which we started developing in 2008 to promote sharing common implementations and data in this field. We designed TIE‛s architecture and functionalities focusing on the evaluation, comparison, and combination of different traffic classification techniques, which can be applied to both live traffic and previously captured traffic traces. Through scientific collaborations, and thanks to the support of the open source community, this platform gradually evolved over the past five years, supporting an increasing number of functionalities, some of which we highlight in this article through sample use cases."

,
     "datePublished": "2014.3",
     "description": "The 95th percentile billing mechanism has been an industry de facto standard for transit providers for well over a decade. While the simplicity of the scheme makes it attractive as a billing mechanism, dramatic evolution in traffic patterns, associated interconnection practices and industry structure over the last two decades motivates an obvious question: is it still appropriate? In this paper, we evaluate the 95th percentile pricing mechanism from the perspective of transit providers, using a decade of traffic statistics from SWITCH (a large research/academic network), and more recent traffic statistics from 3 Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). We find that over time, heavy-inbound and heavy-hitter networks are able to achieve a lower 95th-to-average ratio than heavy-inbound and moderate-hitter networks, possibly due to their ability to better manage their traffic profile. The 95th percentile traffic volume also does not necessarily reflect the cost burden to the provider, motivating our exploration of an alternative metric that better captures the costs imposed on a network. We define the provision ratio for a customer, which captures its contribution to the provider‛s peak load."

     "description": "An IP darkspace is a globally routed IP address space with no active hosts. All traffic destined to darkspace addresses is unsolicited and often originates from network scanning or attacks. A sudden increases of different types of darkspace traffic can serve as indicator of new vulnerabilities, misconfigurations or large scale attacks. In our analysis we take advantage of the fact that darkspace traffic typically originates from processes that use randomly chosen addresses or ports (e.g. scanning) or target a specific address or port (e.g. DDoS, worm spreading). These behaviors induce a concentration or dispersion in feature distributions of the resulting traffic aggregate and can be distinguished using entropy as a compact representation. Its lightweight, unambiguous, and privacy-compatible character makes entropy a suitable metric that can facilitate early warning capabilities, operational information exchange among network operators, and comparison of analysis results among a network of distributed IP darkspaces."

We apply a well-known technique in information visualization — multiple coordinated views — to Internet-specific data. We animate these coordinated views to study the temporal evolution of an event along different dimensions, including geographic spread, topological (address space) coverage, and traffic impact. We explain the techniques we used to create the visualization, and using two recent case studies we describe how this capability to simultaneously view multiple dimensions of events enabled greater insight into their properties."

     "description": "One challenge in understanding the evolution of Internet infrastructure is the lack of systematic mechanisms for monitoring the extent to which allocated IP addresses are actually used. Address utilization has been monitored via actively scanning the entire IPv4 address space. We evaluate the potential to leverage passive network traffic measurements in addition to or instead of active probing. Passive traffic measurements introduce no network traffic overhead, do not rely on unfiltered responses to probing, and could potentially apply to IPv6 as well. We investigate two challenges in using passive traffic for address utilization inference: the limited visibility of a single observation point; and the presence of spoofed IP addresses in packets that can distort results by implying faked addresses are active. We propose a methodology for removing such spoofed traffic on both darknets and live networks, which yields results comparable to inferences made from active probing. Our preliminary analysis reveals a number of promising findings, including novel insight into the usage of the IPv4 address space that would expand with additional vantage points."

     "datePublished": "2014.1",
     "description": "In the mid 2000s there was some concern in the research and operational communities over the scalability of BGP, the Internet‛s interdomain routing protocol. The focus was on update churn (the number of routing protocol messages that are exchanged when the network undergoes routing changes) and whether churn was growing too fast for routers to handle. Recent work somewhat allayed those fears, showing that update churn grows slowly in IPv4, but the question of routing scalability has re-emerged with IPv6. In this work, we develop a model that expresses BGP churn in terms of four measurable properties of the routing system. We show why the number of updates normalized by the size of the topology is constant, and why routing dynamics are qualitatively similar in IPv4 and IPv6. We also show that the exponential growth of IPv6 churn is entirely expected, as the underlying IPv6 topology is also growing exponentially."

     "description": "The AS topology incompleteness problem is derived from difficulties in the discovery of p2p links, and is amplified\r\nby the increasing popularity of Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) to support peering interconnection. We describe,\r\nimplement, and validate a method for discovering currently invisible IXP peering links by mining BGP communities\r\nused by IXP route servers to implement multilateral peering (MLP), including communities that signal the intent to restrict announcements to a subset of participants at a given IXP. Using route server data juxtaposed with a mapping of\r\nBGP community values, we can infer 206K p2p links from 13 large European IXPs, four times more p2p links than what is directly observable in public BGP data. The advantages of the proposed technique are threefold. First, it utilizes existing BGP data sources and does not require the deployment of additional vantage points nor the acquisition of private data. Second, it requires only a few active queries, facilitating repeatability of the measurements. Finally, it offers a new source of data regarding the dense establishment of MLP at IXPs."

     "description": "In February 2011 the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) exhausted its free pool of IPv4 addresses, and the regional registries (RIRs) have started to run out of IPv4 addresses as well. As RIRs have started rationing allocations, IPv4 transfer markets have emerged as a new mechanism to acquire IPv4 addresses. Barring a few high-profile exceptions, IPv4 transfers have largely flown under the radar. In this work, we use the lists of transfers published by three RIRs to characterize the transfer market - the types of players involved, the sizes and characteristics of transferred address blocks, and the visibility of transferred address blocks in the routing table before and after the transfer. Next, we take first steps toward detecting address transfers using BGP data from the Routeviews and RIPE repositories from 2004-2013. We identify reasons why legitimate changes in prefix origin could be mistakenly inferred to be transfers, and implement a series of 10 filters that remove 86% of candidate transfers. Our results indicate that BGP-based detection of transfers is prone to false positives due to significant noise in BGP data, while some transfers remain undetectable as they involve non-BGP speakers. We describe some additional data sources and analysis techniques that may help reveal an opaque market for IPv4 address block transfers."

     "description": "Impediments to resolving IPv6 router aliases have precluded understanding the emerging router-level IPv6 Internet topology. In this work, we design, implement, and validate the first  _Internet-scale alias resolution technique_ for IPv6. Our technique, _speedtrap_, leverages the ability to induce fragmented IPv6  responses from router interfaces in a particular temporal pattern that produces distinguishing per-router fingerprints. Our algorithm surmounts three fundamental challenges to large-scale IPv6 alias resolution using fragment identifier values: (1) unlike for IPv4, the identifier counters  on IPv6 routers have no natural velocity, (2) the values of these counters are similar across routers, and (3) the packet size required to collect inferences is 46 times larger than required in IPv4. We demonstrate the efficacy of the technique by producing router-level Internet IPv6 topologies using measurements from CAIDA's distributed infrastructure. Our preliminary work represents a step toward understanding the Internet's IPv6 router-level topology, an important objective with respect to IPv6 network resilience, security, policy, and  longitudinal evolution."

     "description": "As the Internet autonomous system (AS)-level topology grows over time, some of its structural properties remain unchanged. Such time-invariant properties are generally interesting because they tend to reflect some fundamental processes or constraints behind Internet growth. As has been shown before, the time-invariant structural properties of the Internet include some most basic ones, such as the degree distribution or clustering. Here, we add to this time-invariant list a nontrivial property-- k-dense decomposition. This property is derived from a recursive form of edge multiplicity, defined as the number of triangles that share a given edge. We show that after proper normalization, the k-dense decomposition of the Internet has remained stable over the last decade, even though the Internet size has approximately doubled, and so has the k-density of its k-densest core. This core consists mostly of content providers peering at Internet eXchange Points, and it only loosely overlaps with the high-degree or high-rank AS core, consisting mostly of tier-1 transit providers. We thus show that high degrees and high k-densities reflect two different Internet-specific properties of ASes (transit versus content providers). As a consequence, even though degrees and k-densities of nodes are correlated, the relative fluctuations are strong, and related to that, random graphs with the same degree distribution or even degree correlations as in the Internet, do not reproduce its k-dense decomposition. Therefore an interesting open question is what Internet topology models or generators can fully explain or at least reproduce the k-dense properties of the Internet."

     "description": "Today's Internet's hourglass architecture centers on a universal network layer (i.e., IP) which implements the minimal functionality necessary for global interconnectivity. This thin waist enabled the Internet's explosive growth by allowing both lower and upper layer technologies to innovate independently. However, IP was designed to create a communication network , where packets named only communication endpoints. Sustained growth in e-commerce, digital media, social networking, and smartphone applications has led to dominant use of the Internet as a distribution network. Distribution networks are fundamentally more general than communication networks, and solving distribution problems via a point-to-point communication protocol is complex and error-prone."

,
     "datePublished": "2013.10",
     "description": "Researchers are faced with time-driven competitive pressures to research and publish, to achieve tenure, and to deliver on grant funding proposals. That ethical considerations can be incongruent with these incentives is neither novel nor unique to information and communication technology (ICT) research. Those conducting ICT research (ICTR) do, however, face a different breed of tensions that can impact research ethics risks. Unfortunately, institutionalized guidance on the protection of research subjects has not kept pace with the rapid transformations  in information technology and infrastructure that have catalyzed changes in research substance and mechanics. \r\n\r\nThe Menlo Report summarizes a set of basic principles to guide the identification and resolution of ethical issues in research about or involving ICT. It illuminates a need to interpret and extend traditional ethical principles to enable ICT researchers and oversight entities to appropriately and consistently assess and render ethically defensible research. The framework it proposes can support current and potential institutional mechanisms that are well served to implement and enforce these principles, such as a research ethics board (REB). The Menlo Report is not an official policy statement of the Department of Homeland Security, but rather, offers guidance primarily for ICT researchers in\r\nacademia and the private sector who may be funded by the government, as well as corporate and independent researchers, professional societies, publication review committees, and funding agencies.\r\n\r\nThis Companion is a complement to the Menlo Report that details the principles and applications more granularly and illustrates their implementation in real and synthetic case studies. It is fundamentally intended for the benefit of society, by illuminating the potential for harm to humans (either directly or indirectly) and by helping researchers understand and preempt or minimize these risks in the lifecycle of their research.

     "description": "Business relationships between ASes in the Internet are typically confidential, yet knowledge of them is essential to understand many aspects of Internet structure, performance, dynamics, and evolution. We present a new algorithm to infer these relationships using BGP paths. Unlike previous approaches, our algorithm does not assume the presence (or seek to maximize the number) of valley-free paths, instead relying on three assumptions about the Internet's inter-domain structure: (1) an AS enters into a provider relationship to become globally reachable; and (2) there exists a peering _clique_ of ASes at the top of the hierarchy, and (3) there is no cycle of p2c links. We assemble the largest source of validation data for AS-relationship inferences to date, validating 34.6% of our 126,082 c2p and p2p inferences to be 99.6% and 98.7% accurate, respectively. Using these inferred relationships, we evaluate three algorithms for inferring each AS's _customer cone_, defined as the set of ASes an AS can reach using customer links. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithms for studying the rise and fall of large transit providers over the last fifteen years, including recent claims about the flattening of the AS-level topology and the decreasing influence of \"tier-1\" ASes on the global Internet."

     "datePublished": "2013.8",
     "description": "The dynamic nature of the telecommunications industry, with its rapidly changing technology and industry structure, presents a serious challenge to the theory and practice of regulation, which has a slower time scale and a tendency to embed assumptions about technology and industry into regulation. This paper proposes a model that attempts to capture two durable and persistent features of today‛s telecommunications ecosystem: the use of layered platforms to implement desired functionality; and interconnection between actors at different platform layers. We use platform theory, and in particular theories of multi-sided platforms (MSPs), to focus on key technical and business aspects of today‛s industry. We use an MSP-aware layered model of the ecosystem to explore several recent and impending innovations in the ecosystem that have been naively conflated with the global Internet, illuminate their differences, and describe how regulators could use our model to more rigorously consider them. Finally, to illustrate its potential as a baseline for future research, we briefly consider how this model can help scope consistent policy discourse of three open questions: specialized services, minimum quality regulations (‟the dirt road“ problem), and structural separation.

     "description": "In statistical physics any given system can be either at an equilibrium or away from it. Networks are not an exception. Most network models can be classified as either equilibrium or growing. Here we show that under certain conditions there exists an equilibrium formulation for any growing network model, and vice versa. The equivalence between the equilibrium and nonequilibrium formulations is exact not only asymptotically, but even for any finite system size. The required conditions are satisfied in random geometric graphs in general and causal sets in particular, and to a large extent in some real networks."

As with previous AIMS workshops, the goals were to further our understanding of the potential and limitations of active measurement research and infrastructure in the wide-area Internet, and to promote cooperative solutions and coordinated strategies to address future data needs of the network and security operations and research communities. The workshop focus this year was on creating, managing, and analyzing annotations of large longitudinal active Internet measurement data sets. Due to popular demand, we also dedicated half a day to large-scale active measurement (performance/topology) from mobile/cellular devices. This report describes topics discussed at this year‛s workshop. \r\n\r\nMaterials related to the workshop are available at the [ISMA 2013 AIMS-5 website](https://www.caida.org/workshops/isma/1302/)."

,
     "datePublished": "2013.6",
     "description": "We present the design and evaluation of ITMgen, a tool for generating synthetic but representative Interdomain Traffic Matrices (ITMs). ITMgen is motivated by the observation that gravity-based models do not reflect application level or regional characteristics of Internet traffic. ITMgen works at the level of connections, taking into account the relative sizes of ASes, their popularity with respect to various applications, and the relation between forward and reverse traffic for different application types. The necessary parameters for integrating application types and the distribution of content popularity can be realistically estimated by combining public sources like Alexa that capture traffic trends at a macro level with local traffic sampling (NetFlow, DPI) for providing an additional enhancement layer at the micro level. Using the above philosophy we demonstrate that we can synthesize ITMs that match real-world measurements closer than the current state of the art. In addition, the modular design philosophy of ITMgen makes it easy to integrate additional enhancement layers that improve the accuracy of our existing implementation."

     "description": "Internet Background Radiation (IBR) is unsolicited network traffic mostly generated by malicious software, e.g., worms, scans. In previous work, we extracted a signal from IBR traffic arriving at a large (/8) segment of unassigned IPv4 address space to identify large-scale disruptions of connectivity at an Autonomous System (AS) granularity, and used our technique to study episodes of government censorship and natural disasters. Here we explore other IBR-derived metrics that may provide insights into the causes of macroscopic connectivity disruptions. We propose metrics indicating packet loss (e.g., due to link congestion) along a path from a specific AS to our observation point. We use three case studies to illustrate how our metrics can help identify packet loss characteristics of an outage. These metrics could be used in the diagnostic component of a semi-automated system for detecting and characterizing large-scale outages."

We introduce a new peering scheme, Cost-Benefit-Analysis, which, unlike existing peering strategies, gives ASes the ability to analyze the impact of each peering link on their economic fitness. Using this analysis, ASes engage in only those peering relations that can have a positive impact on their fitness. "

     "description": "A critical step in creating accurate Internet topology maps from traceroute data is mapping IP addresses to routers, a process known as alias resolution. Recent work in alias resolution inferred aliases based on similarities in IP ID time series produced by different IP addresses. We design, implement, and experiment with a new tool that builds on these insights to scale to Internet-scale topologies, i.e., millions of addresses, with greater precision and sensitivity. MIDAR, our Monotonic ID-Based Alias Resolution tool, provides an extremely precise ID comparison test based on monotonicity rather than proximity.\r\n\r\nMIDAR integrates multiple probing methods, multiple vantage points, and a novel sliding-window probe scheduling algorithm to increase scalability to millions of IP addresses. Experiments show that MIDAR‛s approach is effective at minimizing the false positive rate sufficiently to achieve a high positive predictive value at Internet scale. We provide sample statistics from running MIDAR on over 2 million addresses. We also validate MIDAR and RadarGun against available ground truth and show that MIDAR‛s results are significantly better than RadarGun's. Tools such as MIDAR can enable longitudinal study of the Internet‛s topological evolution."

     "description": "Discovering router-level IPv6 topologies is important to understanding IPv6 growth, structure, and evolution and relation to IPv4. This work presents a fingerprint-based IPv6 alias resolution technique that induces fragmented responses from IPv6 router interfaces. We leverage the way in which IPv6 implements fragmentation to provide reliable inferences. We demonstrate perfect alias resolution accuracy in a controlled environment, and on a small subset of the production IPv6 Internet for which we have ground-truth. Internet-wide testing finds that over 70% of IPv6 interfaces probed respond to the test. Our promising results suggest a valuable technique to aid IPv6 topology discovery."

     "description": "We investigated how Patch Tuesday affects the volume and characteristics of malicious and unwanted traffic as observed by a large IPv4 (/8) darkspace monitor over the first six months of 2012. We did not discover significant changes in overall traffic volume following Patch Tuesday, but we found a significant increase of the number of active hosts sending to our darkspace monitor the day after Patch Tuesday for all six investigated months. Our early results suggest the effects of Patch Tuesday are worth deeper investigation. Detecting time intervals during which new sources become active can help tune sampling methods toward activity periods that likely contain more interesting information (i.e., many new malicious sources) than other time periods."

,
     "datePublished": "2012.12",
     "description": "Our growing dependence on networks has inspired a burst of research activity in the field of network science. One focus of this research is to derive network models capable of explaining common structural characteristics of large real networks, such as the Internet, social networks, and many other complex networks. A particular goal is to understand how these characteristics affect the various processes that run on top of these networks, such as routing, information sharing, data distribution, searching, and epidemics. Understanding the mechanisms that shape the structure and drive the evolution of real networks can also have important applications in designing more efficient recommender and collaborative filtering systems, and for predicting missing and future links - an important problem in many disciplines.\r\n\r\nKrioukov et al. have shown that there are intrinsic connections between complex network topologies and hyperbolic geometry, since the former exhibit hierarchical, tree-like organization, while the latter is the geometry of trees. Following Krioukov et al., Papadopoulos et al., have recently shown that trade-offs between popularity and similarity shape the structure and dynamics of growing complex networks, and that these trade-offs in network dynamics give rise to hyperbolic geometry. The work in Papadopoulos et al. introduces a simple model for constructing synthetic growing networks in the hyperbolic plane, which simultaneously exhibit many common structural and dynamical characteristics of real networks. We call the model of Papadopoulos et al. the Popularity×Similarity Optimization (PSO) model.\r\n\r\nGiven the ability of the PSO model to construct synthetic growing networks that resemble real networks across a wide range of structural and dynamical characteristics, an interesting question is whether one can reverse the synthesis, and given a real network, map (embed) the network into the hyperbolic plane, in a way congruent with the PSO model. Our main contribution in this work is an affirmative answer to this question and a systematic framework that accomplishes this task, by replaying the network‛s geometric growth. The proposed framework, called HyperMap, is quite simple and it is supported by theoretical analysis. We apply this framework to the Autonomous Systems (AS) topology of the real Internet and show that it produces meaningful results, identifying communities of ASs that belong to the same geographic region. Further, we show that the proposed framework has a remarkable predictive power, demonstrated by its ability to predict missing links with high precision. While we consider here the AS Internet topology and the prediction of missing links, there are also other interesting areas where the proposed framework could find applications, e.g., in community detection, and in the prediction of future links."

In previous work, we extracted signal from IBR traffic that allowed us to identify largescale disruptions of connectivity at an Autonomous System (AS) level due to government censorship or natural disasters. Here we explore another IBR-derived metric which may provide insights into the causes of macroscopic connectivity disruptions. Specifically, we propose a metric indicating packet loss (e.g., because of link congestion) from a specific AS."

     "description": "Prediction and control of the dynamics of complex networks is a central problem in network science. Structural and dynamical similarities of different real networks suggest that some universal laws might accurately describe the dynamics of these networks, albeit the nature and common origin of such laws remain elusive. Here we show that the causal network representing the large-scale structure of spacetime in our accelerating universe is a power-law graph with strong clustering, similar to many complex networks such as the Internet, social, or biological networks. We prove that this structural similarity is a consequence of the asymptotic equivalence between the large-scale growth dynamics of complex networks and causal networks. This equivalence suggests that unexpectedly similar laws govern the dynamics of complex networks and spacetime in the universe, with implications to network science and cosmology."

     "description": "Botnets are the most common vehicle of cyber-criminal activity. They are used for spamming, phishing, denial of service attacks, brute-force cracking, stealing private information, and cyber warfare. Botnets carry out network scans for several reasons, including searching for vulnerable machines to infect and recruit into the botnet, probing networks for enumeration or penetration, etc. We present the measurement and analysis of a horizontal scan of the entire IPv4 address space conducted by the Sality botnet in February of last year. This 12-day scan originated from approximately 3 million distinct IP addresses, and used a heavily coordinated and unusually covert scanning strategy to try to discover and compromise VoIP-related (SIP  server) infrastructure. We observed this event through the UCSD Network Telescope, a /8 darknet continuously receiving large amounts of unsolicited traffic, and we correlate this traffic data with other public sources of data to validate our inferences. Sality is one of the largest botnets ever identified by researchers, its behavior represents ominous advances in the evolution of modern malware: the use of more sophisticated stealth scanning strategies by millions of coordinated bots, targeting critical voice communications infrastructure. This work offers a detailed dissection of the botnet‛s scanning behavior, including general methods to correlate, visualize, and extrapolate botnet behavior across the global Internet."

     "description": "We use historical BGP data and recent active measurements to analyze trends in the growth, structure, dynamics and performance of the evolving IPv6 Internet, and compare them to the evolution of IPv4. We find that the IPv6 network is maturing, albeit slowly. While most core Internet transit providers have deployed IPv6, edge networks are lagging. Early IPv6 network deployment was stronger in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, than in North America. Current IPv6 network deployment still shows the same pattern. The IPv6 topology is characterized by a single dominant player — Hurricane Electric — which appears in a large fraction of IPv6 AS paths, and is more dominant in IPv6 than the most dominant player in IPv4. Routing dynamics in the IPv6 topology are largely similar to those in IPv4, and churn in both networks grows at the same rate as the underlying topologies. Our measurements suggest that performance over IPv6 paths is comparable to that over IPv4 paths if the AS-level paths are the same, but can be much worse than IPv4 if the AS-level paths differ."

     "description": "Recent analysis of traffic reaching the UCSD Network Telescope (a /8 darknet) revealed a sophisticated botnet scanning event that covertly scanned the entire IPv4 space in about 12 days. We only serendipitously discovered this event while studying a completely unrelated behavior (censorship episode in Egypt in February 2011), but we carefully studied the scan, including validating and crosscorrelating our observations with other large data set shared by others. We would like to extend these strategies to detect other large-scale malicious events. We suspect the fight against malware will benefit greatly (and perhaps require) collaborative sharing of diverse large-scale security-related data sets. We hope to discuss both the technical and the data-sharing policy aspects of this challenge at the workshop."

     "name": "Peering Strategy Adoption by Transit Providers in the Internet: A Game Theoretic Approach"
,
     "datePublished": "2012.9",
     "description": "The Internet is composed of tens of thousands of Autonomous Systems (ASes)which interconnect with one another through customer provider (transit) and settlement-free peering links. Their interconnection objectives are a function of their business type e.g., transit providers, content providers, enterprise customers etc. In order to achieve these objectives the ASes adopt a set of criteria which are used to assess potential and existing settlement-free peering relationships. These relationships are bilateral in nature, i.e., for two ASes x and y to establish a peering relationship, they must satisfy each other‛s peering criteria. The set of criteria used by an AS for assessing potential peering relationships is referred to as its peering policy. We commonly observe three peering policies publicized by ASes in PeeringDB, an open portal where ASes voluntarily share information about their peering policies, — Restrictive, Selective and Open. These peering policies are explained in a later section.\r\n\r\nThe peering strategy adoption by ASes of different categories taken from a recent snapshot of PeeringDB showed that Open is the\r\ndominant peering strategy among all AS categories, with more than 60% of ASes in each category using Open peering. The fact that\r\n64% of NSPs (transit providers) use Open peering is especially surprising since transit providers prefer other ASes as their customers\r\nrather than peers. Why do transit providers tend to peer openly? \r\n\r\nIn our work we use an agent-based computational model, GENESIS, to study peering strategy adoption by transit providers. Our computational model incorporates most of the real world constraints e.g., geographic co-location, skewed distribution of traffic,\r\neconomies of scale, multiple transit prices per AS etc. We employed computational modeling as incorporation of all these constraints\r\nin an analytical model quickly renders the model intractable. In that work we find that peering decisions are interdependent and\r\nmyopic decisions and lack of coordination among ASes results in Open peering as an attractor among peering strategies for transit\r\nproviders. Interestingly, we observe that this adoption of Open peering results in loss of economic fitness for a majority of transit\r\nproviders. Further, large scale adoption of Open peering results in stable equilibria.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we use game theoretic analysis to gain further insight into peering strategy adoption by transit providers in the Internet. We employ a much simplified variant of GENESIS in our current work to keep the analytical approach tractable. Our analytical results corroborate our previous simulation based results. Our results show that when transit providers have complete information\r\nabout co-located providers they can optimize their economic fitness by adopting Selective peering strategy. Further, any uncertainty in\r\nthe system causes the providers to gravitate towards Open peering, a suboptimal equilibrium."

     "description": "The principle that \"popularity is attractive\" underlies preferential attachment, which is a common explanation for the emergence of scaling in growing networks. If new connections are made preferentially to more popular nodes, then the resulting distribution of the number of connections possessed by nodes follows power laws as observed in many real networks. Preferential attachment has been directly validated for some real networks (including the Internet), and can be a consequence of different underlying processes based on node fitness, ranking, optimization, random walks or duplication. Here we show that popularity is just one dimension of attractiveness; another dimension is similarity. We develop a framework in which new connections optimize certain trade-offs between popularity and similarity, instead of simply preferring popular nodes. The framework has a geometric interpretation in which popularity preference emerges from local optimization. As opposed to preferential attachment, our optimization framework accurately describes the large-scale evolution of technological (the Internet), social (trust relationships between people) and biological (Escherichia coli metabolic) networks, predicting the probability of new links with high precision. The framework that we have developed can thus be used for predicting new links in evolving networks, and provides a different perspective on preferential attachment as an emergent phenomenon."

     "description": "This report proposes a framework for ethical guidelines for computer and information security research, based on the principles set forth in the 1979 Belmont Report, a seminal guide for ethical research in the biomedical and behavioral sciences. Despite its age, the Belmont Report‛s insightful abstraction renders it a valuable cornerstone for other domains. We describe how the three principles in the Belmont report can be usefully applied in fields related to research about or involving information and communication technology. ICT research raises new challenges resulting from interactions between humans and communications technologies. In particular, today‛s ICT research contexts contend with ubiquitously connected network environments, overlaid with varied, often discordant legal regimes and social norms. We illustrate the application of these principles to information systems security research — a critical infrastructure priority with broad impact and demonstrated potential for widespread harm — although we expect the proposed framework to be relevant to other disciplines, including those targeted by the Belmont report but now operating in more complex and interconnected contexts.\r\n\r\nWe first outline the scope and motivation for this document, including a historical summary of the conceptual framework for traditional human subjects research, and the landscape of ICT research stakeholders. We review four core ethical principles, the three from the Belmont Report (Respect for Persons, Beneficence, and Justice) and an additional principle Respect for Law and Public Interest. We propose standard methods to operationalize these principles in the domain of research involving information and communication technology: identification of stakeholders and informed consent; balancing risks and benefits; fairness and equity; and compliance, transparency and accountability, respectively. We also describe how these principles and applications can be supported through assistive external oversight by ethical review boards, and internal self-evaluation tools such as an Ethical Impact Assessment.\r\n\r\nThe intent of this report is to help clarify how the characteristics of ICT raise new potential for harm and to show how a reinterpretation of ethical principles and their application can lay the groundwork for ethically defensible research.\r\n"

Discussion topics included: the surprisingly stability in the number of BGP updates over time; techniques for improving measurement and analysis of inter-domain routing policies; an update on Colorado State's BGPMon instrumentation; using BGP data to improve the interpretation of traceroute data, both for real-time diagnostics (e.g., AS traceroute) and for large-scale topology mapping; using both BGP and traceroute data to support detection and mapping infrastructure integrity, including different types of of filtering and censorship; and use of BGP data to analyze existing and proposed approaches to securing the interdomain routing system. This report briefly summarizes the presentations and discussions that followed.   "

     "description": "There is much interest in studying the structure and evolution of the Internet at the Autonomous System (AS) level. However, limitations of public data sources in detecting settlement-free peering links meant that prior work focused almost exclusively on transit links. In this work, we explore the possibility of studying the full connectivity of a small set of ASes, which we call usable monitors. Usable monitors, while a subset of the ASes that provide BGP feeds to Routeviews/RIPE collectors, are better suited to an evolutionary study than other ASes. We propose CMON, an algorithm to classify the links of usable monitors as transit or non-transit. We classify usable monitors as transit providers (large and small), content producers, content consumers and education/research networks. We highlight key differences in the evolution of connectivity of usable monitors, and measure transitions between different relationships for the same pair of ASes.\r\n"

     "description": "Internet topology maps are an important tool for those who seek to describe, analyze, or model various aspects of the Internet‛s structure, behavior, and evolution. While different methods of measuring topology yield substantially different views of the Internet, many studies rely on only a single data source, sometimes outdated or incomplete, or mix fundamentally different data sources into a single topology. \r\n\r\nThese compromises may undermine the fidelity of derived models and integrity of analysis results. We report on the results of our systematic comparison of Internet topologies derived from different data sources and characterizing the Internet at three granularities relevant to research as well as operations of network infrastructure: IP address (interface), router, and Autonomous System (AS)."

     "description": "Identifying the statistical properties of the Interdomain Traffic Matrix (ITM) is fundamental for Internet techno-economic studies but challenging due to the lack of adequate traffic data. In this work, we utilize a Europe-wide measurement infrastructure deployed at the GÉANT backbone network to examine some important spatial properties of the ITM. In particular, we analyze its sparsity and characterize the distribution of traffic generated by different ASes. Our study reveals that the ITM is sparse and that the traffic sent by an AS can be modeled as the LogNormal or Pareto distribution, depending on whether the corresponding traffic experiences congestion or not. Finally, we show that there exist significant correlations between different ASes mostly due to relatively few highly popular prefixes."

However, its impact on Internet topology measurements is not well known,\r\nand it is possible for some MPLS configurations to lead to\r\nfalse router-level links in maps derived from traceroute data.\r\nIn this paper, we introduce a measurement-based classification of MPLS tunnels, identifying tunnels where IP hops are\r\nrevealed but not explicitly tagged as label switching routers,\r\nas well as tunnels that obscure the underlying path. Using a large-scale dataset we collected, we show that paths\r\nfrequently cross MPLS tunnels in today‛s Internet: in our\r\ndata, at least 30% of the paths we tested traverse an MPLS\r\ntunnel. We also propose and evaluate several methods to\r\nreveal MPLS tunnels that are not explicitly flagged as such:\r\nwe discover that their fraction is significant (up to half the\r\nexplicit tunnel quantity) but most of them do not obscure\r\nIP-level topology discovery."

     "datePublished": "2012.3",
     "description": "During the last decade, unsolicited one-way Internet traffic has been used to study malicious activity on the Internet. Researchers usually observe such traffic using network telescopes deployed on darkspace (unused address space). When darkspace observations began ten years ago, one-way traffic was minimal. Over the last five years, however, traffic levels have risen so that they are now high enough to require more subtle differentiation - raw packet and byte or even port counts make it hard to discern and distinguish new activities.\r\n\r\nTo make changes in composition of one-way traffic aggregates more detectable, we have developed iatmon (Inter-Arrival Time Monitor), a freely available measurement and analysis tool that allows one to separate one-way traffic into clearly-defined subsets. Initially we have implemented two subsetting schemes; source types, based on the schema proposed in J. Treurniet's \"A network activity classification schema and its application to scan detection\"; and inter-arrival-time (IAT) groups that summarise source behaviour over time.\r\n\r\nWe use 14 types and 10 groups, giving us a matrix of 140 type-and-group subsets. Each subset constitutes only a fraction of the total traffic, so changes within the subsets are easily observable when changes in total traffic levels might not even be noticeable.\r\n\r\nWe report on our experience with this tool to observe changes in one-way traffic at the UCSD network telescope over the first half of 2011.\r\n\r\nDaily average plots of source numbers and their traffic volumes show clear long-term changes in several of our types and groups."

,
     "datePublished": "2012.3",
     "description": "The Internet is a complex and dynamic interconnection of about 40,000 Autonomous Systems (ASes). A link in this context represents a business agreement between the corresponding two ASes that they can exchange traffic under various policy and capacity constraints. Each AS X follows a peering strategy (or ‟peering policy“) that is used to determine whether X will accept to peer with another AS Y. Even though they vary in their details, most peering policies can be grouped in three distinct classes: Restrictive (X peers only if necessary to avoid Internet partitioning; typically used by Tier-1 transit providers), Selective (X peers only with ASes that have comparable traffic volume), and Open (X is willing to peer with everyone, except its customers). The conventional wisdom is that transit providers use Restrictive or Selective peering, so that they can engage other ASes as their customers, and thus increase their transit revenues. In the last few years, however, there is evidence that an increasing fraction of the interdomain traffic flows through peering links between content providers (or CDNs) and access providers that serve end users. A major fraction of the Internet‛s traffic thus bypasses intermediate transit providers, and flows directly from producers to consumers. So, a question that motivated this study is: How are transit providers reacting to the previous peering trend?"

,
     "datePublished": "2012.3",
     "description": "We propose an agent-based network formation\r\nmodel for the Internet at the Autonomous System (AS) level.\r\nThe proposed model, called GENESIS, is based on realistic\r\nprovider and peering strategies, with ASes acting in a myopic and decentralized manner to optimize a cost-related fitness function.\r\n\r\nGENESIS captures key factors that affect the network formation dynamics: highly skewed traffic matrix, policy-based routing, geographic co-location constraints, and the costs of transit/peering agreements. As opposed to analytical game-theoretic models, which focus on proving the existence of equilibria, GENESIS is a computational model that simulates the network formation process and allows us to actually compute distinct equilibria (i.e.,\r\nnetworks) and to also examine the behavior of sample paths\r\nthat do not converge. We find that such oscillatory sample paths occur in about 10% of the runs, and they always involve tier-1 ASes, resembling the tier-1 peering disputes often seen in practice. GENESIS results in many distinct equilibria that are highly sensitive to initial conditions and the order in which ASes (agents) act. This implies that we cannot predict the properties of an individual AS in the Internet. However, certain properties of the global network or of certain classes of ASes are predictable. We also examine whether the underlying game is zero-sum, and\r\nidentify three sufficient conditions for that property. \r\n\r\nFinally, we apply GENESIS in a specific ‟what-if“ question, asking how the openness towards peering affects the resulting network in terms of topology, traffic flow and economics. Interestingly, we find that the peering openness that maximizes the fitness of different network classes (tier-1, tier-2 and tier-3 providers) closely matches that seen in real-world peering policies."

     "description": "Research of or involving Information and Communications Technology (ICT) presents a wide variety of ethical challenges and the relative immaturity of ethical decision making in the ICT research community has prompted calls for additional research and guidance. The Menlo report, a revisiting of the seminal Belmont report, seeks to bring clarity to this arena by articulating a basic set of ethical principles for ICT research. However the gap between such principles and actionable guidance for the ethical conduct of ICT research is large. In previous work we sought to bridge this gap through the construction of an ethical impact assessment (EIA) tool that provided a set of guiding questions to help researchers understand how to apply the Menlo principles. While a useful tool, experiences in the intervening years have caused us to rethink and expand the EIA. In this paper we: (i) discuss the various challenges encountered in applying the original EIA, (ii) present a new EIA framework that represents our evolved understanding, and (iii)  retrospectively apply this EIA to an ethically challenging, original study in ICTR."

Over the past 10 years the research community and the networking industry have investigated, proposed and developed several classification approaches. While traffic classification techniques are improving in accuracy and efficiency, the continued proliferation of different Internet application behaviors, in addition to growing incentives to disguise some applications to avoid filtering or blocking, are among the reasons that traffic classification remains one of many open problems in Internet research. In this article we review recent achievements and discuss future directions in traffic classification, along with their trade-offs in applicability, reliability, and privacy. We outline the persistently unsolved challenges in the field over the last decade, and suggest several strategies for tackling these challenges to promote progress in the science of Internet traffic classification."

     "datePublished": "2012.1",
     "description": "Unsolicited one-way Internet traffic, also called Internet background radiation (IBR), has been used for years to study malicious activity on the Internet, including worms, DoS attacks, and scanning address space looking for vulnerabilities to exploit. We show how such traffic can also be used to analyze macroscopic Internet\r\nevents that are unrelated to malware. We examine two phenomena: country-level censorship of Internet communications described in recent work, and natural disasters (two recent earthquakes). We introduce a new metric of local IBR activity based on the number of unique IP addresses per hour contributing to IBR. The advantage of this metric is that it is not affected by bursts of traffic from a few hosts. Although we have only scratched the surface, we are convinced that IBR traffic is an important building block for comprehensive monitoring, analysis, and possibly even detection of events unrelated to the IBR itself. In particular, IBR offers the opportunity to monitor the impact of events such as natural disasters on network infrastructure, and in particular reveals a view of events that is complementary to many existing measurement platforms based on (BGP) control-plane views or targeted active ICMP probing."

     "description": "In the first months of 2011, Internet communications were disrupted in several North African countries in response to civilian protests and threats of civil war. In this paper we analyze episodes of these disruptions in two countries: Egypt and Libya. Our analysis relies on multiple sources of large-scale data already available to academic researchers: BGP interdomain routing control plane data; unsolicited data plane traffic to unassigned address space; active macroscopic traceroute measurements; RIR delegation files; and MaxMind's geolocation database. We used the latter two data sets to determine which IP address ranges were allocated to entities within each country, and then mapped these IP addresses of interest to BGP-announced address ranges (prefixes) and origin ASes using publicly available BGP data repositories in the U.S. and Europe. We then analyzed observable activity related to these sets of prefixes and ASes throughout the censorship episodes. Using both control plane and data plane data sets in combination allowed us to narrow down which forms of Internet access disruption were implemented in a given region over time. Among other insights, we detected what we believe were Libya's attempts to test firewall-based blocking before they executed more aggressive BGP-based disconnection. Our methodology could be used, and automated, to detect outages or similar macroscopically disruptive events in other geographic or topological regions."

That ICANN chose to relinquish this responsibility puts the U.S. government in the awkward position of trying to tighten the few inadequate controls that remain over ICANN, and leaves individual and responsible corporate citizens in the unenviable yet familiar position of bracing for the consequences.

,
     "datePublished": "2011.9",
     "description": "Our goal is to understand the evolution of the autonomous system (AS) ecosystem over the last 12 years. Instead of focusing on abstract topological properties, we classify ASes into a number of types depending on their function and business type. Furthermore, we consider the semantics of inter-AS links: customer—provider versus peering relations. We find that the available historic datasets from RouteViews and RIPE are not sufficient to infer the evolution of peering links, and so we restrict our focus to customer—provider links. Our findings highlight some important trends in the evolution of the Internet over the last 12 years and hint at what the Internet is heading toward. After an exponential increase phase until 2001, the Internet has settled into a slower exponential growth in terms of both ASes and inter-AS links. The growth is mostly due to enterprise networks and content/access providers at the periphery of the Internet. The average path length remains almost constant, mostly due to the increasing multihoming degree of transit and content/access providers. The AS types differ significantly from each other with respect to their rewiring activity; content/access providers are the most active. A few large transit providers act as ‟attractors“ or ‟repellers“ of customers. For many providers, strong attractiveness precedes strong repulsiveness by 3—9 months. Finally, in terms of regional growth, we find that the AS ecosystem is now larger and more dynamic in Europe than in North America."

Nodes in these networks are characterized by hidden variables that control the appearance of links between node pairs. We derive analytic expressions for the degree distribution, degree correlations, the distribution of the number of common neighbors, and the bipartite clustering coefficient in these networks. We also establish the relationship between degrees of nodes in original bipartite networks and in their unipartite projections. We further demonstrate how hidden variable formalism can be applied to analyze topological properties of networks in certain bipartite network models, and verify our analytical results in numerical simulations.

     "description": "On February 10-12, 2011, CAIDA hosted the third Workshop on Active Internet Measurements (AIMS-3) as part of our series of Internet Statistics and Metrics Analysis (ISMA) workshops. As with the previous two AIMS workshops, the goals were to further our understanding of the potential and limitations of active measurement research and infrastructure in the wide-area Internet, and to promote cooperative solutions and coordinated strategies to address future data needs of the network and security research communities. For three years, the workshop has fostered interdisciplinary conversation among researchers, operators, and government, focused on analysis of goals, means, and emerging issues in active Internet measurement projects. The first workshop emphasized discussion of existing hardware and software platforms for macroscopic measurement and mapping of Internet properties, in particular those related to cybersecurity. The second workshop included more performance evaluation and data-sharing approaches. This year we expanded the workshop agenda to include active measurement topics of more recent interest: broadband performance; gauging IPv6 deployment; and measurement activities in international research networks."

     "description": "Exhaustion of the Internet addressing authority's (IANA) available IPv4 address space, which occurred in February 2011, is finally exerting exogenous pressure on network operators to begin to deploy IPv6. There are two possible outcomes from this transition. IPv6 may be widely adopted and embraced, causing many existing methods to measure and monitor the Internet to be ineffective. A second possibility is that IPv6 languishes, transition mechanisms fail, or performance suffers. Either scenario requires data, measurement, and analysis to inform technical, business, and policy decisions. We survey available data that have allowed limited tracking of IPv6 deployment thus far, describe additional types of data that would support better tracking, and offer a perspective on the challenging future of IPv6 evolution."

     "description": "Effective Internet measurement raises daunting issues for the research community and funding agencies. Improved understanding of the structure and dynamics of Internet topology, routing, workload, performance, and vulnerabilities remains disturbingly elusive, in part for lack of realistic and representative datasets available to scientific researchers. The dearth is understandable; measurement of operational Internet infrastructure involves managing more complex and interconnected dimensions than measurement in most scientific disciplines: logistical, financial, methodological, technical, legal, and ethical. CAIDA has been navigating these challenges with modest success fifteen years, collecting, coordinating, curating, and sharing data sets for the Internet research and operational community in support of Internet science. Our three current biggest challenges which we hope to explore at the workshop are: sustainable collection, curation, and storage of large volumes of data; privacy-respecting sharing; and long-term archiving for reproducibility."

     "description": "The Internet topology discovery has been an extensive research subject those last years. While the raw data is collected using large traceroute campaigns, additional probing and/or extensive computation are required to gather subsets of IP addresses into single identifiers corresponding to routers. This alias resolution process leads to a router level map of the Internet. In this paper, we push further the Internet router level mapping with a new probing tool called MERLIN. \r\n\r\nMERLIN takes advantage of mrinfo, a multicast management tool that silently collects all IPv4 multicast enabled interfaces of a router and all its multicast links towards its neighbors. Our new probing tool fixes mrinfo technical limitations and eases the deployment of multicast probing campaign. We deploy and evaluate the performance of MERLIN at large scale. We investigate the completeness of MERLIN by providing a lower bound on the proportion of information that it may miss. We also demonstrate that the use of several vantage points is crucial to circumvent IGMP filtering in order to increase the amount of collected routers. MERLIN is a valuable tool for the understanding of the router level topology of the Internet. "

,
     "datePublished": "2011.5",
     "description": "A critical step in creating accurate Internet topology maps from traceroute data is mapping IP addresses to routers, a process known as alias resolution. Recent work in alias resolution inferred aliases based on similarities in IP ID time series produced by different IP addresses. We design, implement, and experiment with a new tool that builds on these insights to scale to Internet-scale topologies, i.e., millions of addresses, with greater precision and sensitivity. MIDAR, our Monotonic ID-Based Alias Resolution tool, provides an extremely precise ID comparison test based on monotonicity rather than proximity. MIDAR integrates multiple probing methods, multiple vantage points, and a novel sliding-window probe scheduling algorithm to increase scalability to millions of IP addresses. Experiments show that MIDAR's approach is effective at minimizing the false positive rate sufficiently to achieve a high positive predictive value at Internet scale. We provide sample statistics from running MIDAR on over 2 million addresses, and validate these results against available ground truth. Tools such as MIDAR can help preserve longitudinal history of the Internet's topological evolution. "

     "description": "We attempt a systematic quantitative comparison of currently available geolocation service providers. We add depth to previous contributions by analyzing inconsistencies across databases for different geographic (RIR) regions and organization (Autonomous Systems) types. We compare results on a country granularity, using a methodology that compares each database against the majority vote across all databases with answers for a given IP address. On a finer granularity than country, rigorous formal comparison gets trickier. Unlike the discrete country labels, coordinates can have nominally different values yet still represent approximately the same location, We compare the databases at a lat-long granularity using an 80 km threshold for two lat-longs coordinates to be in the same geographic region. We describe our process for selecting this threshold, and our centroid-based algorithm for comparing database lat-long results against a majority of responses from the set of databases we evaluated. While not a foolproof methodology - the databases could all be converging to the same wrong answers over time - it assumes that database providers successfully work toward improving the accuracy of their databases over time. In the absence of substantial ground truth, our method offers a systematic way to study the geolocation databases to reveal insights, summarized at the end of the paper. We intend to re-run the comparison experiment using additional databases later in 2011; we welcome constructive feedback on the methodology so we can further improve our next experiment. "

,
     "datePublished": "2011.1",
     "description": "Data collected using traceroute-based algorithms underpins research into the Internet's router-level topology, though it is possible to infer false links from this data. One source of false inference is the combination of per-flow load-balancing, in which more than one path is active from a given source to destination, and classic traceroute, which varies the UDP destination port number or ICMP checksum of successive probe packets, which can cause per-flow load-balancers to treat successive packets as distinct flows and forward them along different paths. Consequently, successive probe packets can solicit responses from unconnected routers, leading to the inference of false links. This paper examines the inaccuracies induced from such false inferences, both on macroscopic and ISP topology mapping. We collected macroscopic topology data to 365k destinations, with techniques that both do and do not try to capture load balancing phenomena. We then use alias resolution techniques to infer if a measurement artifact of classic traceroute induces a false router-level link. This technique detected that 2.71% and 0.76% of the links in our UDP and ICMP graphs were falsely inferred due to the presence of load-balancing. We conclude that most per-flow load-balancing does not induce false links when macroscopic topology is inferred using classic traceroute. The effect of false links on ISP topology mapping is possibly much worse, because the degrees of a tier-1 ISP's routers derived from classic traceroute were inflated by a median factor of 2.9 as compared to those inferred with Paris traceroute.

     "description": "We provide a simple proof that graphs in a general class of self-similar networks have zero percolation threshold. The considered self-similar networks include random scale-free graphs with given expected node degrees and zero clustering, scale-free graphs with finite clustering and metric structure, growing scale-free networks, and many real networks. The proof and the derivation of the giant component size do not require the assumption that networks are treelike. Our results rely only on the observation that self-similar networks possess a hierarchy of nested subgraphs whose average degree grows with their depth in the hierarchy. We conjecture that this property is pivotal for percolation in networks."

,
     "datePublished": "2010.12",
     "description": "Recent measurements and anecdotal evidence indicate that the Internet ecosystem is rapidly evolving from a multi-tier hierarchy built mostly with transit (customer-provider) links to a dense mesh formed with mostly peering links. This transition can have major impact on the global Internet economy as well as on the traffic flow and topological structure of the Internet. In this paper, we study this evolutionary transition with an agent-based network formation model that captures key aspects of the interdomain ecosystem, viz., interdomain traffic flow and routing, provider and peer selection strategies, geographical constraints, and the economics of transit and peering interconnections. The model predicts several substantial differences between the Hierarchical Internet and the Flat Internet in terms of topological structure, path lengths, interdomain traffic flow, and the profitability of transit providers. We also quantify the effect of the three factors driving this evolutionary transition. Finally, we examine a hypothetical scenario in which a large content provider produces more than half of the total Internet traffic."

     "description": "The Internet topology discovery has been an extensive research subject those last years. While the raw data is collected using large traceroute campaigns, additional probing and/or extensive computation are required to gather subsets of IP addresses into single identifiers corresponding to routers. This process, known as alias resolution, leads to a router level map of the Internet. In this paper, we push further the Internet router level mapping with a new probing tool called MERLIN. MERLIN is based on mrinfo, a multicast management tool. mrinfo is able to silently collect all IPv4 multicast enabled interfaces of a router and all its multicast links towards its neighbors: it does not need or rely on any alias resolution mechanism. In addition, MERLIN comes with the advantage of being much more scalable than standard data gathering techniques. In this paper, we deploy and evaluate the performance of MERLIN. We demonstrate that the use of several vantage points is crucial to circumvent IGMP filtering in order to collect large amounts of routers. We also investigate the completeness of MERLIN by providing a lower bound on the proportion of information that it may miss. Finally, our dataset and the MERLIN implementation are freely available."

     "description": "We develop a geometric framework to study the structure and function of complex networks. We assume that hyperbolic geometry underlies these networks, and we show that with this assumption, heterogeneous degree distributions and strong clustering in complex networks emerge naturally as simple reflections of the negative curvature and metric property of the underlying hyperbolic geometry. Conversely, we show that if a network has some metric structure, and if the network degree distribution is heterogeneous, then the network has an effective hyperbolic geometry underneath. We then establish a mapping between our geometric framework and statistical mechanics of complex networks. This mapping interprets edges in a network as non-interacting fermions whose energies are hyperbolic distances between nodes, while the auxiliary fields coupled to edges are linear functions of these energies or distances. The geometric network ensemble subsumes the standard configuration model and classical random graphs as two limiting cases with degenerate geometric structures. Finally, we show that targeted transport processes without global topology knowledge, made possible by our geometric framework, are maximally efficient, according to all efficiency measures, in networks with strongest heterogeneity and clustering, and that this efficiency is remarkably robust with respect to even catastrophic disturbances and damages to the network structure."

     "description": "The Internet infrastructure is severely stressed. Rapidly growing overheads associated with the primary function of the Internet---routing information packets between any two computers in the world---cause concerns among Internet experts that the existing Internet routing architecture may not sustain even another decade. Here we present a method to map the Internet to a hyperbolic space. Guided with the constructed map, which we release with this paper, Internet routing exhibits scaling properties close to theoretically best possible, thus resolving serious scaling limitations that the Internet faces today. Besides this immediate practical viability, our network mapping method can provide a different perspective on the community structure in complex networks."

     "description": "Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use complex peering policies, stipulating various rules for peering with other networks. Peering strategy is often considered a \"black art\" rather than science, and the outcome of a peering negotiation can depend on factors that are neither technical nor economic. Consequently, ISPs are required to make difficult decisions about the set of networks they should peer with, and the price they should demand/offer to ensure a stable peering link. We propose a quantitative framework for settlement-free and paid-peering links, based on the \"value\" of a peering link, i.e., the benefit that networks see from that link. We first study a solution where a centralized oracle determines a provably stable, optimal and fair price for a paid-peering link, based on perfect knowledge of the revenues and costs of each network. We next show that with perfect knowledge, the centralized solution can be implemented individually by the peering networks. We then study the effects of inaccurate estimation of peering value by the peering networks. Finally, we examine how value-based peering affects the density of peering links, the nature of end-to-end paths, and the profitability of various network types in the global Internet."

     "description": "Information privacy (IP) is an evolution of control tug-o-war between individual rights and interests, social responsibility, and innovation. When users overtly interact with or passively engage a website, social networking or otherwise, they enter a privacy risk zone. Most often, they cannot be sure whether data is surreptitiously being collected, will be used, or further disclosed in ways that contravene their privacy preferences. While we have evolved the 'state of the art' to obligate sites to disclose their privacy collection, use and disclosure policies, protections nevertheless hinge on ex ante user trust that websites will walk the talk.\r\n\r\nA privacy solution steeped in information use restrictions and obligations can be approached by better engineering the identification and application of the underlying reasonable expectations upon which our privacy controls (laws, policies, standards) operate. I propose that the solution must be derived from the nature of the space creating the problem to begin with, specifically, that a scale-free problem demands a solution derived from scale-free network science.\r\n\r\nIt seems intuitive that privacy harms are not tied to whether you're at home, or in a park, with a crowd, or in a public phone booth -- yet the trigger for whether we have a reasonable expectation of privacy (REP) is still largely tethered to the contours demarcating public-private spaces. In general, if one's behavior is conducted in 'private' then REP attaches, but if it is exposed to the 'public' then surveillance, tracking, collection, and use of that information is fair game. How do we play the game, however, when our privacy is tethered to information that is decoupled from our persons across the Web ecosystem that does not intuitively fall along public-private boundaries?\r\n\r\nWe lack a consistent, objective measurement for assessing reasonable expectation of privacy and need to realign standards and their applications to more empirically reflect the contours of the Internetwork environment in which the privacy risks occur and privacy interests need protection. This paper proposes a new way to domesticate REP by using models from network science.\r\n\r\nThis paper advocates approaching this problem from the conceptual strategy that information privacy is a complex adaptive system. Other legal scholarship has applied this strategy to legal contexts such as environmental policy, intellectual property law, common law jurisprudence, Internet jurisdiction, and information privacy torts. This approach advocates the novel application of network science to a broader value that underpins many of our privacy controls-reasonable expectation of privacy. It suggests that there is a co-evolution between privacy controls (laws, regulations, standards) and informal norms. From this position, REP should be both a top-down and bottom-up tenet, where social norms of what citizens should reasonably expect to be afforded privacy protection should influence our controls, and our controls should shape our REP. As such, an information privacy regime that is predominated by the latter, governance-imposed notion of REP does not objectively reflect the reality of REP 'in the trenches' and threatens to institutionalize a fiction that results in inefficiencies and disrespect for ordering forces that protect individual rights and fosters social good and innovation.\r\n\r\nWe can infer the incongruity between legacy-driven measures of REP and the changed normative expectations wrought by the Internetwork environment from contemporary controversies surrounding online social networking, geo-location based services, targeted behavioral advertising, and data anonymization. Using a network science model, we may be able to harmonize the understandings and applications of REP across associated privacy controls such as the 4th Amendment, ECPA, FOIA, self-regulatory standards, consumer protection regulations, privacy torts, civil discovery rules, and private contracts and policies. Finally, network science techniques may enable us to operationalize REP into a more predictable, coherent, empirical framework for descriptive evidentiary proof and prescriptive risk management."

     "description": "Networks portray a multitude of interactions through which people meet, ideas are spread, and infectious diseases propagate within a society. Identifying the most efficient \"spreaders\" in a network is an important step to optimize the use of available resources and ensure the more efficient spread of information. Here we show that, in contrast to common belief, the most influential spreaders in a social network do not correspond to the best connected people or to the most central people (high betweenness centrality). Instead, we find: (i) The most efficient spreaders are those located within the core of the network as identified by the k-shell decomposition analysis. (ii) When multiple spreaders are considered simultaneously, the distance between them becomes the crucial parameter that determines the extend of the spreading. Furthermore, we find that-- in the case of infections that do not confer immunity on recovered individuals-- the infection persists in the high k-shell layers of the network under conditions where hubs may not be able to preserve the infection. Our analysis provides a plausible route for an optimal design of efficient dissemination strategies. \r\n"

     "description": "The Domain Name System (DNS) is a crucial component of today.s Internet. The top layer of the DNS hierarchy (the root name- servers) is facing dramatic changes: cryptographically signing the root zone with DNSSEC, deploying Internationalized Top-Level Domain (TLD) Names (IDNs), and addition of other new global Top Level Domains (TLDs). ICANN has stated plans to deploy all of these changes in the next year or two, and there is growing interest in measurement, testing, and provisioning for foreseen (or unforeseen) complications. We describe the Day-in-the-Life annual datasets available to characterize workload at the root servers, and we provide some analysis of the last several years of these datasets as a baseline for operational preparation, additional research, and informed policy. We confirm some trends from previous years, including the low fraction of clients (0.55% in 2009) still generating most misconfigured \"pollution\", which constitutes the vast majority of observed queries to the root servers. We present new results on security-related attributes of the client population: an increase in the prevalence of DNS source port randomization, a short-term measure to improve DNS security; and a surprising decreasing trend in the fraction of DNSSEC-capable clients. Our insights on IPv6 data are limited to the nodes who collected IPv6 traffic, which does show growth. These statistics serve as a baseline for the impending transition to DNSSEC. We also report lessons learned from our global trace collection experiments, including improvements to future measurements that will help answer critical questions in the evolving DNS landscape. "

     "description": "To describe, analyze, and model the topological and structural characteristics of the Internet, researchers use Internet maps constructed at the router or autonomous system (AS) level. Although progress has been made on each front individually, a dual graph representing connectivity of routers with AS labels remains an elusive goal. We take steps toward merging the router-level and AS-level views of the Internet. We start from a collection of traces, i.e. sequences of IP addresses obtained with large-scale traceroute measurements from a distributed set of vantage points. We use state-of-the-art alias resolution techniques to identify interfaces belonging to the same router. We develop novel heuristics to assign routers to ASes, producing an AS-router dual graph. We validate our router assignment heuristics using data provided by tier-1 and tier-2 ISPs and five research networks, and show that we successfully assign 80% of routers with interfaces from multiple ASes to the correct AS. When we include routers with interfaces from a single AS, the accuracy drops to 71%, due to the 24% of total inferred routers for which our measurement or alias resolution fails to find an interface belonging to the correct AS. We use our dual graph construct to estimate economic properties of the AS-router dual graph, such as the number of internal and border routers owned by different types of ASes. We also demonstrate how our techniques can improve IP-AS mapping, including resolving up to 62% of\r\nfalse loops we observed in AS paths derived from traceroutes.\r\n"

,
     "datePublished": "2010.3",
     "description": "We show that complex (scale-free) network topologies naturally emerge from hyperbolic metric spaces. Hyperbolic geometry facilitates maximally efficient greedy forwarding in these networks. Greedy forwarding is topology-oblivious. Nevertheless, greedy packets find their destinations with 100% probability following almost optimal shortest paths. This remarkable efficiency sustains even in highly dynamic networks. Our findings suggest that forwarding information through complex networks, such as the Internet, is possible without the overhead of existing routing protocols, and may also find practical applications in overlay networks for tasks such as application-level routing, information sharing, and data distribution.

     "description": "The assumption of routing symmetry is often embedded into traffic\r\nanalysis and classification tools. This paper uses passively captured\r\nnetwork data to estimate the amount of traffic actually routed\r\nsymmetrically on a specic link. We propose a Flow-Based Symmetry\r\nEstimator (FSE)  a set of metrics to assess symmetry in terms of\r\nflows, packets and bytes, which disregards inherently asymmetrical\r\ntraffic such as UDP, ICMP and TCP background radiation. This\r\nnormalized metric allows fair comparison of symmetry across different\r\nlinks. We evaluate our method on a large heterogeneous dataset,\r\nand confirm anecdotal reports that routing symmetry typically does\r\nnot hold for non-edge Internet links, and decreases as one moves\r\ntoward core backbone links, due to routing policy complexity. Our\r\nproposed metric for traffic asymmetry induced by routing policies will\r\nhelp the community improve traffic characterization techniques and\r\nformats, but also support quantitative formalization of routing\r\npolicy effects on links in the wild.\r\n\r\n"

     "description": "We study firm collaborations in the life sciences and the information and communication technology sectors. We propose an approach to characterize industrial leadership using k-shell decomposition, with top-ranking firms in terms of market value in higher k-shell layers. We find that the life sciences industry network consists of three distinct components: a \"nucleus,\" which is a small well-connected subgraph, \"tendrils,\" which are small subgraphs consisting of small degree nodes connected exclusively to the nucleus, and a \"bulk body,\" which consists of the majority of nodes. Industrial leaders, i.e., the largest companies in terms of market value, are in the highest k-shells of both networks. The nucleus of the life sciences sector is very stable: once a firm enters the nucleus, it is likely to stay there for a long time. At the same time we do not observe the above three components in the information and communication technology sector. We also conduct a systematic study of these three components in random scale-free networks. Our results suggest that the sizes of the nucleus and the tendrils in scale-free networks decrease as the exponent of the power-law degree distribution \u0026#955; increases, and disappear for \u0026#955;\u0026ge;3. We compare the k-shell structure of random scale-free model networks with two real-world business firm networks in the life sciences and in the information and communication technology sectors. We argue that the observed behavior of the k-shell structure in the two industries is consistent with the coexistence of both preferential and random agreements in the evolution of industrial networks.\r\n"

As its name suggests, it is based on preferential attachment. All of its parameters are measurable from available Internet topology data. Given the estimated values of these parameters, our analytic results predict a definitive set of statistics characterizing the AS topology structure. These statistics are not part of model formulation. The MPA model thus closes the \"measure-model-validate-predict\" loop, and provides further evidence that preferential attachment is the main driving force behind Internet evolution. "

     "description": "IP source address forgery, or \"spoofing,\" is a long-recognized consequence of the Internet's lack of packet-level authenticity. Despite historical precedent and filtering and tracing efforts, attackers continue to utilize spoofing for anonymity, indirection, and amplification. Using a distributed infrastructure and approximately 12,000 active measurement clients, we collect data on the prevalence and efficacy of current best practice source address validation techniques. Of clients able to test their provider's source-address filtering rules, we find 31% able to successfully spoof an arbitrary, routable source address, while 77% of clients otherwise unable to spoof can forge an address within their own /24 subnetwork. We uncover significant differences in filtering depending upon network geographic region, type, and size. Our new tracefilter tool for filter location inference finds 80% of filters implemented a single IP hop from sources, with over 95% of blocked packets observably filtered within the source's autonomous system. Finally, we provide initial longitudinal results on the evolution of spoofing revealing no mitigation improvement over four years of measurement. Our analysis provides an empirical basis for evaluating incentive and coordination issues surrounding existing and future Internet packet authentication strategies. "

     "description": "The coarsest approximation of the structure of a complex network, such as the Internet, is a simple\nundirected unweighted graph. This approximation, however, loses too much detail. In reality,\nobjects represented by vertices and edges in such a graph possess some nontrivial internal structure\nthat varies across and differentiates among distinct types of links or nodes. In this work, we\nabstract such additional information as network annotations. We introduce a network topology\nmodeling framework that treats annotations as an extended correlation profile of a network. Assuming\nwe have this profile measured for a given network, we present an algorithm to rescale it in\norder to construct networks of varying size that still reproduce the original measured annotation\nprofile.\n\nUsing this methodology,we accurately capture the network properties essential for realistic simulations\nof network applications and protocols, or any other simulations involving complex network\ntopologies, including modeling and simulation of network evolution. We apply our approach to the\nAutonomous System (AS) topology of the Internet annotated with business relationships between\nASs. This topology captures the large-scale structure of the Internet. In depth understanding of\nthis structure and tools to model it are cornerstones of research on future Internet architectures\nand designs. We find that our techniques are able to accurately capture the structure of annotation\ncorrelations within this topology, thus reproducing a number of its important properties in\nsynthetically-generated random graphs.\n"

On February 12-13, 2009, CAIDA hosted the Workshop on Active Internet Measurements (AIMS) as part of our series of Internet Statistics and Metrics Analysis (ISMA) workshops which provide a venue for researchers, operators, and policymakers to exchange ideas and perspectives. The two-day workshop included presentations, discussion after each presentation, and breakout sessions focused on how to increase potential and mitigate limitations of active measurements in the wide area Internet. We identified relevant stakeholders who may support and/or oppose measurement, and explored how collaborative solutions might maximize the benefit of research at minimal cost. This report describes the findings of the workshop, outlines open research problems identified by participants, and concludes with recommendations that can benefit both Internet science and communications policy.\r\n\r\nSlides from workshop presentations are linked from the [ISMA 2009 Workshop on Active Internet Measurements](https://www.caida.org/workshops/isma/0902/) page.\r\n"

This paper presents the design, development and experimental evaluation of gt, an open source software toolset for associating ground truth information with Internet traffic traces. By probing the monitored host's kernel to obtain information on active Internet sessions, gt gathers ground truth at the application level. Preliminary experimental results show that gt's effectiveness comes at little cost in terms of overhead on the hosting machines. Furthermore, when coupled with other packet inspection mechanisms, gt can derive ground truth not only in terms of applications (e.g., e-mail), but also in terms of protocols (e.g., SMTP vs. POP3).\r\n"

,
     "datePublished": "2009.9",
     "description": "Routing information is the most basic and, perhaps, the most complicated function that networks perform. Conventional wisdom states that to find paths to destinations through the complex network maze, nodes must communicate and exchange information about the status of their connections to other nodes. This communication overhead is considered one of the most serious scaling limitations of our primary communication technologies today, including the Internet and emerging wireless and sensor networks.\r\n\r\nIn many other networks in nature however, nodes can efficiently communicate, even though they do not exchange any information about the current global state of the network topology. Milgram's 1969 experiments showed a classic demonstration of this surprising effect: humans can find paths to destinations through their social acquaintance network, even though no human has global knowledge of its structure. Much later, Jon Kleinberg offered the first popular explanation. In his model, each node, in addition to being a part of the graph representing the global network topology, resides in a coordinate space - a grid embedded in the Euclidean plane. The coordinates of a node in the plane, its address, abstracts the information about the destination in Milgram's experiments. Each node knows:\r\n\r\n1.  its coordinates;\r\n2.  the coordinates of its neighbors; and\r\n3.  the coordinates of the destination written on the packet. Given these three pieces of information, the node can route greedily by selecting its direct neighbor closest to the destination in the plane.\r\n\r\nClearly, the described greedy forwarding strategy can be efficient only if the network topology is in some way congruent with the underlying space. Therefore, the Kleinberg model stands closer to the beginning of an explanation for Milgram's experiment than to its end. The model does not (try to) reproduce the basic topological properties of social networks through which messages were traveling in Milgram's experiments. For instance, the Kleinberg model produces only k-regular graphs while social networks, the Internet, and many other complex networks are known to be scale-free, meaning that:\r\n\r\n1. the distribution P(k) of node degrees k in a network follows power laws P(k) ~ k^y with exponent y often lying between 2 and 3; and\r\n2. the network has strong clustering, i.e., a large number of triangular subgraphs.\r\n\r\nOur work follows Kleinberg's formalism. We assume that nodes in the Internet and other complex networks exist in some spaces that underlie the observed network topologies. We call these spaces hidden metric spaces. The observed network topology is coupled to the hidden space geometry in the following way: a link between two nodes in the topology exists with a certain probability that depends on the distance between two nodes in the hidden geometry. One possible and plausible explanation for the Kleinberg model's inability to naturally produce scale-free topologies is that the spaces hidden beneath the Internet and other real networks are not Euclidean planes. The main results of our work is that if we model hidden spaces as non-Euclidean hyperbolic spaces, then their negative curvature leads to:\r\n\r\n1. natural emergence of scale-free topologies constructed over such hidden spaces; and\r\n2. extremely efficient greedy forwarding on these topologies, achieving almost 100% reachability and optimal (i.e., shortest) path lengths, even under dynamic network conditions.\r\n"

     "description": "Network motifs are small building blocks of complex networks, such as gene regulatory networks. The frequent appearance of a motif may be an indication of some network-specific utility for that motif, such as speeding up the response times of gene circuits. However, the precise nature of the connection between motifs and the global structure and function of networks remains unclear. Here we show that the global structure of some real networks is statistically determined by the distributions of local motifs of size at most 3, once we augment motifs to include node degree information. That is, remarkably, the global properties of these networks are fixed by the probability of the presence of links between node triples, once this probability accounts for the degree of the individual nodes. We consider a social web of trust, protein interactions, scientific collaborations, air transportation, the Internet, and a power grid. In all cases except the power grid, random networks that maintain the degree-enriched connectivity profiles for node triples in the original network reproduce all its local and global properties. This finding provides an alternative statistical explanation for motif significance. It also impacts research on network topology modeling and generation. Such models and generators are guaranteed to reproduce essential local and global network properties as soon as they reproduce their 3-node connectivity statistics. "

     "description": "We establish a connection between observed scale-free topologies and hidden hyperbolic geometries of complex networks. Hidden geometries are coarse metric abstractions of the approximately hierarchical community structure of complex networks, used to estimate node similarities. Space expands exponentially in hyperbolic geometry, and scale-free topologies emerge as a consequence of this exponential expansion. Fermi-Dirac statistics connects observed topology to hidden geometry: observed edges are fermions, hidden distances are their energies; the curvature of the hidden space affects the heterogeneity of the degree distribution, while clustering is a function of temperature. Understanding the connection between topology and geometry of complex networks contributes to studying the efficiency of their functions, and may find practical applications in many disciplines, ranging from Internet routing to brain, cell signaling, or protein folding research.

The\r\nhyperbolic geometry can be used to facilitate maximally efficient greedy forwarding on these topologies where packets can find\r\ntheir destinations with 100% probability following almost optimal, i.e., shortest paths, without the need for global topology\r\nknowledge. We demonstrate that this remarkable efficiency is robust under dynamic network conditions.

Here we show that these ultrasmall worlds can be navigated in ultrashort time. Greedy routing on scale-free networks embedded in metric spaces finds paths with the average length scaling also as lnlnN. Greedy routing uses only local information to navigate a network. Nevertheless, it finds asymptotically the shortest paths, a direct computation of which requires global topology knowledge. Our findings imply that the peculiar structure of complex networks ensures that the lack of global topological awareness has asymptotically no impact on the length of communication paths. These results have important consequences for communication systems such as the Internet, where maintaining knowledge of current topology is a major scalability bottleneck. \r\n"

As its name suggests, it is based on preferential attachment.  All of its parameters are measurable from available Internet topology data.  Given the estimated values of these parameters, our analytic results predict a definitive set of statistics characterizing the AS topology structure.  These statistics are not part of model formulation.  The MPA model thus closes the \"measure-model-validate-predict\" loop, and provides further evidence that preferential attachment is the main driving force behind Internet evolution.\r\n"

     "description": "Routing information through networks is a universal phenomenon in both natural and manmade complex systems. When each node has full knowledge of the global network connectivity, finding efficient communication paths is merely a matter of distributed computation. However, in many real networks nodes communicate efficiently even without such global intelligence. Here we show that the peculiar structural characteristics of observable complex networks are exactly the characteristics needed to maximize their communication efficiency without global knowledge. We also describe a general mechanism that explains this connection between network structure and function. This mechanism relies on the presence of a metric space hidden behind an observable network. Our findings suggest that real networks in nature have underlying metric spaces that remain undiscovered. Their discovery would have enormous practical applications ranging from routing in the Internet and searching social networks, to studying information flows in neural, gene regulatory networks, or signaling pathways.\r\n"

     "description": "The well-known traceroute probing method discovers links between interfaces on Internet routers. IP alias resolution, the process of identifying IP addresses belonging to the same router, is a critical step in producing Internet topology maps. We compare known alias resolution techniques, and suggest a practical combination of techniques that can produce the most accurate and complete IP-to-router mapping.\r\n"

     "description": "Recent research on Internet traffic classification algorithms has yielded a flurry of proposed approaches for distinguishing types of traffic, but no systematic comparison of the various algorithms. This fragmented approach to traffic classification research leaves the operational community with no basis for consensus on what approach to use when, and how to interpret results. In this work we critically revisit traffic classification by conducting a thorough evaluation of three classification approaches, based on transport layer ports, host behavior, and flow features. A strength of our work is the broad range of data against which we test the three classification approaches: seven traces with payload collected in Japan, Korea, and the US. The diverse geographic locations, link characteristics and application traffic mix in these data allowed us to evaluate the approaches under a wide variety of conditions. We analyze the advantages and limitations of each approach, evaluate methods to overcome the limitations, and extract insights and recommendations for both the study and practical application of traffic classification. We make our software, classifiers, and data available for researchers interested in validating or extending this work.\r\n\r\n"

     "description": "We analyzed the largest simultaneous collection of full-payload packet traces from a core component of the global Internet infrastructure ever made available to academic researchers. Our dataset consists of three large samples of global DNS traffic collected during three annual 'Day in the Life of the Internet' (DITL) experiments in January 2006, January 2007, and March 2008. Building on our previous comparison of DITL 2006 and DITL 2007 DNS datasets [28], we venture to extract historical trends, comparisons with other data sources, and interpretations, including traffic growth, usage patterns, impact of anycast distribution, and persistent problems in the root nameserver system that reflect ominously on the global Internet. Most notably, the data consistently reveals an extraordinary amount of DNS pollution - an estimated 98% of the traffic at the root servers should not be there at all. Unfortunately, there is no clear path to reducing the pollution, so root server operators, and those who finance them, must perpetually overprovision to handle this pollution. Our study presents the most complete characterization to date of traffic reaching the roots, and while the study does not adequately fulfill the 'Day in the Life of the Internet' vision, it does succeed at unequivocally demonstrating that the infrastructure on which we are all now betting our professional, personal, and political lives deserves a closer and more scientific look.\r\n"

     "description": "Several traceroute probe methods exist, each designed to perform better in a scenario where another fails.  This paper examines the effects that the choice of probe method has on the inferred forward IP path by comparing the paths inferred with UDP, ICMP, and TCP-based traceroute methods to (1) a list of routable IP addresses, (2) a list of known routers, and (3) a list of well-known websites.  We further compare methods by examining seven months of macroscopic Internet topology data collected by CAIDA's Archipelago infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWe found significant differences in the topology observed using different probe methods.  In particular, we found that ICMP-based traceroute methods tend to successfully reach more destinations, as well as collect evidence of a greater number of AS links. UDP-based methods infer the greatest number of IP links, despite reaching the fewest destinations.  We hypothesise that some per-flow load balancers implement different forwarding policies for TCP and UDP, and run a specific experiment to confirm this hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

     "description": "As the Internet has become critical infrastructure penetrating many aspects of modern society, a better understanding of its behavior is of great interest to a range of fields from science to public policy. Characteristic patterns of Internet often vary with geography, and coherent study of these geographical trends is important to optimizing operations, engineering, and capacity and service planning. However, the massive volumes of data, and its wide geographic dispersion challenge common mapping and visualizing techniques. In this paper, we present a novel visualization technique -- the Influence Map -- which renders a compressed representation of geospatially distributed Internet data.\r\n\r\nWe apply this new technique to illustrate the behavior of a critical Internet service -- specifically, the observed interactions between DNS root name servers and their clients. Efficient visualizations of these datasets reveal relationships between Internet services and users on a macroscopic scale and improve our ability to model geography-related Internet features. "

     "description": "The complexity and dynamics of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the only inter-domain routing protocol available for the Internet, is driving the need for efficient, scalable, realistic and meaningful network simulations. To properly simulate the behavior of BGP as currently deployed, one requires both a realistic topology and a realistic model of BGP. Although a large number of topology generators are available, they have limitations in either their scalability or in the ability to model AS relationships. In this work, we describe the methodology employed to efficiently construct meaningful large scale simulations of the order of a several thousand autonomous systems using parallel and distributed simulations thereby leveraging the power of multiprocessors and clusters of workstations. Using the Georgia Tech Network Simulator (GTNetS) as the framework, we simulate a realistic topology constructed from the BGP routing table updates collected by RouteViews and further incorporate the policy constraints based on the autonomous systems relationships inferred by the Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA). Our BGP model (called BGP\u002b\u002b) found in GTNetS is built from the open source Zebra BGP implementation, which is deployed in a number of existing Internet Autonomous Systems. Using BGP\u002b\u002b and our topology generation methods, we show how the simulations can be used to study the effect of using BGP anycasting at DNS root servers on the several BGP metrics, including convergence time and churn.\n"

     "description": "Updating legal frameworks to accommodate technological\r\nadvancement of communications capabilities requires first\r\nupdating other legal frameworks to accommodate empirically\r\ngrounded research into what we have built, how it is used,\r\nand what it costs to sustain. Unfortunately for -- and\r\ndue to -- well-intentioned policymakers, our scientific\r\nknowledge about the Internet is weak because researchers\r\nare typically not allowed access to any data on operational\r\nnetwork infrastructure for privacy reasons. This data\r\naccess problem was recognized long ago for its detrimental\r\nimpact on infrastructure protection capabilities; many\r\npublic and private sector efforts have failed to solve it.\r\nPublic policy intended to protect individual user privacy\r\nplaces the research community in the absurd situation\r\nof not being able to do the most basic network research\r\neven on the networks established explicitly to support\r\nacademic network research. Despite the methodological\r\nlimitations of Internet science today, the few data\r\npoints available suggest a dire picture of the future.\r\nBut while the situation overwhelmingly indicates the\r\nneed for a closer objective look, the only people with\r\nmeasurement capability on publicly accessible network\r\ninfrastructure today are tasked with inferring as much\r\nprivate information on individual users as possible --\r\nwhether it's to target terrorists or ads. The traditional\r\nmode of getting data from public infrastructures to\r\ninform policymaking -- regulating its collection -- \r\nis a quixotic path, since the government regulatory\r\nagencies have as much reason to be reluctant as providers\r\nregarding disclosure of how the Internet is engineered,\r\nused, and financed. Less surprising with hindsight, the\r\nopaqueness of the infrastructure to empirical analysis\r\nhas generated many problematic responses from rigidly\r\ncircumscribed communities trying to get their jobs done.\r\nAs dismal as it sounds though, the news is not all bad --\r\nthere is a reason everyone wants to be connected to all\r\nthe world's knowledge, as well as eachother, besides its\r\nstatus as the most powerful complex system ever created\r\nby man. The Internet's practical promise for individual\r\nfreedom, democratic engagement, and economic empowerment\r\nis also unparalleled. Moreover, even in the dim light of\r\nthe profoundly needed but underattended interdisciplinary\r\nresearch into the network, we can ascertain some concrete\r\nconstraints on the possible range of policy solutions,\r\nwhich all involve increasing the congruity between what\r\nwe legislate and what we know.\r\n\r\nPrimary Subject Area:   \r\n1.

     "description": "We study the following paradox associated with networks growing according to super-linear preferential attachment: super-linear preference cannot produce scale-free networks in the thermodynamic limit, but there are super-linearly growing network models that perfectly match the structure of some real scale-free networks, such as the Internet. We calculate the degree distribution in super-linearly growing networks with arbitrary average degree, and confirm that in the true thermodynamic limit, these networks are indeed degenerate, i.e., almost all nodes have low degrees. We then show that super-linear growth has vast pre-asymptotic regimes whose depths depend both on the average degree in the network and on how super-linear the preference kernel is. We demonstrate that a super-linearly growing network model can reproduce, in its pre-asymptotic regime, the structure of a real network, if the model captures some sufficiently strong structural constraints -- rich-club connectivity, for example. These findings suggest that real scale-free networks of finite size may exist in pre-asymptotic regimes of network evolution processes that lead to degenerate network formations in the thermodynamic limit.\r\n"

     "description": "Over the past several years, interest in municipal wireless and community networking has increased dramatically.  Thus far, these initiatives have generally focused on networking local communities. The next evolution in network-ing involves peering these networks together.  Research on broadband service provision is desperately needed to help forge new national telecommunications policies and inspire innovation in networking technologies.\n\nWith this goal in mind, the Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) held a workshop to discuss -- and ultimately propose -- collaboration among researchers and networks to simultaneously solve three acute and growing problems facing the Internet. First, there exists a self-reported financial crisis in the Internet infrastructure provider industry that poses a threat to broadband growth and American competitiveness. Second, a data acquisition crisis has stunted the field of network science. Finally, emerging community, municipal, regional, and state networks need additional broadband connectivity but face limited provider, service level, and usage options.\n\nThe Cooperative Measurement and Modeling of Open Networked Systems (COMMONS) Initiative proposes to build or partner with a collaborative national backbone to connect participating community, municipal, regional, and state networks to one another and to the global Internet. The COMMONS provides a platform for Internet researchers to study this infrastructure. It also provides a low-cost medium for networks to peer with one another. This approach will provide vital research results for policymakers across the country and around the world.\n\nPart II of this article describes the findings from the initial COMMONS Strategy Workshop held in December 2006. Part III outlines relevant open research problems identified by the participants. Part IV proposes a framework for the end-to-end interconnection of networks at all levels on a national scale. Finally, the article concludes with a discussion of the steps necessary to bring about such a networking arrangement. Further, this section highlights the potential benefits to the scientific community, network operators and developers, key decision makers, and the general public.\n"

The critical important question left by this work is whether the topologies of real networks can be mapped into appropriate hidden hyperbolic metric spaces.\r\n\r\n"

     "description": "Researchers involved in designing network services and protocols rely on results from simulation and emulation environments to evaluate correctness, performance and scalability. To better understand the behavior of these applications and to predict their performance when deployed across the Internet, the generated topologies that serve as input to simulated and emulated environments must closely match real network characteristics, not just in terms of graph structure (node interconnectivity) but also with respect to various node and link annotations. Relevant annotations include link latencies, AS membership and whether a router is a peering or internal router. Finally, it should be possible to rescale a given topology to a variety of sizes while still maintaining its essential characteristics.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose techniques to generate annotated, Internet router graphs of different sizes based on existing observations of Internet characteristics. We find that our generated graphs match a variety of graph properties observed topologies for a range of target graph sizes. While the best available data of Internet topology currently remains imperfect, the quality of our generated topologies will improve with the fidelity of available measurement techniques or next generation architectures that make Internet structure more transparent.\r\n"

Compact routing is\r\na research field that studies fundamental limits of routing\r\nscalability and designs algorithms that try to meet these\r\nlimits. In particular, compact routing research shows that\r\nshortest-path routing, forming a core of traditional routing\r\nalgorithms, cannot guarantee routing table (RT) sizes that\r\non all network topologies grow slower than linearly as functions\r\nof the network size. However, there are plenty of compact\r\nrouting schemes that relax the shortest-path requirement\r\nand allow for improved, sublinear RT size scaling that\r\nis mathematically provable for all static network topologies.\r\nIn particular, there exist compact routing schemes designed\r\nfor grids, trees, and Internet-like topologies that offer RT\r\nsizes that scale logarithmically with the network size.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that in view of recent results\r\nin compact routing research, such logarithmic scaling\r\non Internet-like topologies is fundamentally impossible in\r\nthe presence of topology dynamics or topology-independent\r\n(flat) addressing. We use analytic arguments to show that\r\nthe number of routing control messages per topology change\r\ncannot scale better than linearly on Internet-like topologies.\r\nWe also employ simulations to confirm that logarithmic RT\r\nsize scaling gets broken by topology-independent addressing,\r\na cornerstone of popular locator-identifier split proposals\r\naiming at improving routing scaling in the presence of\r\nnetwork topology dynamics or host mobility. These pessimistic\r\nfindings lead us to the conclusion that a fundamental\r\nre-examination of assumptions behind routing models\r\nand abstractions is needed in order to find a routing architecture\r\nthat would be able to scale \"indefinitely.\"\r\n"

The incongruence between the\nInternet's underlying architecture and current use and expectations, however,\nmeans we can no longer study Internet technology in isolation from the political\nand economic context in which it is deployed.\n"

We study DNS traffic collected over a two-day\r\nperiod in January 2006 at anycast instances for the C, F and K root\r\nnameservers. We analyze how anycast DNS service affects the worldwide\r\npopulation of Internet users. To determine whether clients actually use\r\nthe instance closest to them, we examine client locations for each root\r\ninstance, and the geographic distances between a server and its clients.\r\nWe find that frequently the choice, which is entirely determined by BGP\r\nrouting, is not the geographically closest one. We also consider\r\nspecific AS paths and investigate some cases where local instances have\r\na higher than usual proportion of non-local clients. We conclude that\r\noverall, anycast roots significantly localize DNS traffic, thereby\r\nimproving DNS service to clients worldwide.\r\n\r\n"

     "description": "\nResearch on performance, robustness, and evolution of the global Internet is fundamentally handicapped without accurate and complete knowledge of the nature and structure of the contractual relationships between Autonomous Systems (ASs). In this work, we first examine the state-of-the-art in inferring AS relationships. We carefully analyze existing techniques and pinpoint limitations and inadequacies associated with them. We then introduce new, improved heuristics addressing the problems we have identified. Seeking to increase the value and reliability of our inference results, we then proceed to direct validation. We perform a survey with ASs' network administrators to collect information on the actual connectivity and policies of the surveyed ASs. Based on the survey results, we find that our new AS relationship inference techniques achieve high levels of accuracy: we correctly infer 96.5% customer to provider (c2p), 82.8% peer to peer (p2p), and 90.3% sibling to sibling (s2s) relationships. We then cross-compare the reported AS connectivity with the AS connectivity data contained in BGP tables. We regret to report that BGP tables miss up to 86.2% of the true adjacencies of the surveyed ASs. The majority of the missing links are of the p2p type, meaning that, in reality, peering links are likely to be more dominant than have been previously reported or conjectured. Finally, to make our results easily accessible and practically useful for the community, we open an AS relationship repository where we archive, on a weekly basis, and make publicly available the complete Internet AS-level topologies enriched with AS relationship information for every pair of AS neighbors.\n"

However, researchers from these different disciplines tend to approach the same problem from different angles. As a result, the field of Internet topology analysis and modeling must untangle sets of inconsistent findings, conflicting claims, and contradicting statements.\r\n\r\nOn May 10-12, 2006, CAIDA hosted the Workshop on Internet topology (WIT). By bringing together a group of researchers spanning the areas of computer science, physics, and the mathematical sciences, the workshop aimed to improve communication across these scientific disciplines, enable interdisciplinary crossfertilization, identify commonalities in the different approaches, promote synergy where it exists, and utilize the richness that results from exploring similar problems from multiple perspectives.\r\n\r\nThis report describes the findings of the workshop, outlines a set of relevant open research problems identified by participants, and concludes with recommendations that can benefit all scientific communities interested in Internet topology research.\r\n\r\n"

Among the most memorable conclusions: .. the outsiders expressed the view that the network research community should not devote all or even the majority of its time to fixing current Internet problems. Instead, networking research should more aggressively seek to develop new ideas and approaches. A program that does this would be centered on the three M's - measurement of the Internet, modeling of the Internet, and making disruptive prototypes."

     "description": "In the past few years, the network measurement community\r\nhas been interested in the problem of internet topology discovery using\r\na large number (hundreds or thousands) of measurement monitors. The\r\nstandard way to obtain information about the internet topology is to\r\nuse the traceroute tool from a small number of monitors. Recent papers\r\nhave made the case that increasing the number of monitors will give a\r\nmore accurate view of the topology. However, scaling up the number of\r\nmonitors is not a trivial process. Duplication of effort close to the mon\r\nitors wastes time by reexploring well-known parts of the network, and\r\nclose to destinations might appear to be a distributed denial-of-service\r\n(DDoS) attack as the probes converge from a set of sources towards a\r\ngiven destination. In prior work, authors of this paper proposed Double\r\ntree, an algorithm for cooperative topology discovery, that reduces the\r\nload on the network, i.e., router IP interfaces and end-hosts, while dis\r\ncovering almost as many nodes and links as standard approaches based\r\non traceroute. This paper presents our open-source and freely download\r\nable implementation of Doubletree in a tool we call traceroute@home.\r\nWe evaluate the performance of our implementation on the PlanetLab\r\ntestbed and discuss a large-scale monitoring infrastructure that could\r\nbenefit of Doubletree.\r\n"

     "description": "Researchers have proposed a variety of metrics to measure important graph properties, for instance, in social, biological, and computer networks. Values for a particular graph metric may capture a graph's resilience to failure or its routing efficiency. Knowledge of appropriate metric values may influence the engineering of future topologies, repair strategies in the face of failure, and understanding of fundamental properties of existing networks. Unfortunately, there are typically no algorithms to generate graphs matching one or more proposed metrics and there is little understanding of the relationships among individual metrics or their applicability to different settings.\r\n\r\nWe present a new, systematic approach for analyzing network topologies. We first introduce the dK-series of probability distributions specifying all degree correlations within d-sized subgraphs of a given graph G. Increasing values of d capture progressively more properties of G at the cost of more complex representation of the probability distribution. Using this series, we can quantitatively measure the distance between two graphs and construct random graphs that accurately reproduce virtually all metrics proposed in the literature. The nature of the dK-series implies that it will also capture any future metrics that may be proposed. Using our approach, we construct graphs for d = 0, 1, 2, 3 and demonstrate that these graphs reproduce, with increasing accuracy, important properties of measured and modeled Internet topologies. We find that the d = 2 case is sufficient for most practical purposes, while d = 3 essentially reconstructs the Internet AS- and router-level topologies exactly. We hope that a systematic method to analyze and synthesize topologies offers a significant improvement to the set of tools available to network topology and protocol researchers."

     "description": "This work is motivated by the observation of one particular type\r\nof unwanted traffic - dynamic DNS updates for private (RFC1918)\r\naddresses, which leaks to global network. This spurious traffic not\r\nonly wastes network resources but also jeopardizes security and\r\nprivacy of users.\r\nWe first look at the magnitude of these updates on two independent\r\nAS112 [1] servers. We then analyze which operating systems\r\nare responsible for these updates by using three levels of signature\r\ntechniques and find that over 97% of updates come from Windows\r\nsystems. While newer versions of Windows OSes are more stringent\r\nin sending private DNS updates, we did not observe an overall\r\ndecreasing trend due to this evolution. Users, software vendors,\r\nand system administrators can take steps to reduce this RFC1918\r\ntraffic. However, since most end users are unlikely to interfere with\r\nvendor default settings, it should be the responsibility of software\r\nvendor and system administrators to take positive action to fix this\r\nproblem.\r\n"

We use this approach on 22 traces (each covering a week or more)\r\ngathered over three years from 2001 through 2004. Across this corpus we quantitatively assess\r\nthe number, duration and focus of attacks, and qualitatively characterize their behavior. In total,\r\nwe observed over 68,000 attacks directed at over 34,000 distinct victim IP addresses -- ranging\r\nfrom well-known e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Hotmail to small foreign ISPs and\r\ndial-up connections.

     "description": "The development of realistic topology generators that produce faithful replicas of Internet topologies is critical for conducting realistic simulation studies of Internet protocols. Despite the volume of research in this area the last several years, current topology generators fail to capture an inherent aspect of the autonomous system (AS) topology of the Internet, namely the fact that AS links reflect business agreements between competing entities, which impose restrictions on how traffic is routed between ASs. These restrictions result in inflated AS paths and generally in suboptimal routing in the Internet. In this work, we first evaluate the importance of modeling AS relationships when conducting accurate and realistic simulation studies. We demonstrate that ignoring AS relationships produces different simulation results than modeling AS relationships based on known relationships between Internet Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Then, we introduce a framework for generating synthetic AS topologies annotated with realistic relationships. In addition to modeling the degree distribution of a network, which is the property that most existing topology generators model, our framework also models new properties that capture the characteristics of AS relationships. Finally, we propose a novel algorithm for generating synthetic graphs, annotated with AS relationships, that reproduce these AS relationships-aware properties.\r\n"

We first introduce a series of probability distributions specifying all degree correlations within d-sized subgraphs of a given graph G. Using this series, we can quantitatively evaluate how close synthetic topologies are to G, construct graphs that accurately reproduce the values of commonly-used graphmetrics of G, and provide a rigorous basis for capturing any future metrics that may be of interest. The d = 0 and d = 1 cases reduce to the known classical (Erdõs-Rényi) random graphs and random graphs with prescribed degree distributions respectively.

     "description": "Although the Internet AS-level topology has been extensively studied over the past few years, little is known about the details of the AS taxonomy. An AS \"node\" can represent a wide variety of organizations, e.g., large ISP, or small private business, university, with vastly different network characteristics, external connectivity patterns, network growth tendencies, and other properties that we can hardly neglect while working on veracious Internet representations in simulation environments. In this paper, we introduce a radically new approach based on machine learning techniques to map all the ASes in the Internet into a natural AS taxonomy. We successfully classify 95.3% of ASes with expected accuracy of 78.1%. We release to the community the AS-level topology dataset augmented with: 1) the AS taxonomy information and 2) the set of AS attributes we used to classify ASes. We believe that this dataset will serve as an invaluable addition to further understanding of the structure and evolution of the Internet.\r\n\r\nThe file [as2attr.tgz](https://www.caida.org/data/as-taxonomy/as2attr.tgz) includes the set of AS attributes we extracted from CAIDA, RouteViews, and Internet Routing Registries data. Each line contains the following tab delimited fields: 1) AS number, 2) organization description record, 3) number of inferred providers, 4) number of inferred peers, 5) number of inferred customers, 6) equivalent number of /24 prefixes covering all the advertised IP space, 7) number of advertised IP prefixes, and 8) inferred AS class. The classes are encoded with the following acronyms: \"t1\" for large ISPs, \"t2\" for small ISPs, \"edu\" for Universities, \"ix\" for IXPs, \"nic\" for NICs, \"comp\" for Customers and \"abstained\" for ASes for which the algorithm did not make a prediction.\r\n\r\nThe file [as_rel.tgz](https://www.caida.org/data/as-taxonomy/as_rel.tgz) includes the AS graph annotated with inferred AS relationships. Our inference is based on heuristics we developed in our previous work. In particular, customer-to-provider relationships are inferred using the methodology of the paper [Inferring AS Relationships: Dead End or Lively Beginning?](https://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2005/asrelationships/), while peer-to-peer links are inferred using the methodology of the paper \"AS Relationships: Inferance and Validation\", which is currently under submission (we hope to post a link here soon). Each line in as_rel.txt is a triplet: A B C, where A B reflects an AS link and C the AS relationship: if (C==0) A B is a p2p link; if (C=-1) A is a customer of B; and if (C==1) A is a provider of B. Each AS link is listed twice as A B and B A. Note that few of the AS numbers listed in as_rel.txt are missing from as2attr.txt, since in the latter we include only the AS numbers for which all six attributes were available. "

     "description": "In the past few years, the network measurement\r\ncommunity has been interested in the problem of internet topology\r\ndiscovery using a large number (hundreds or thousands) of\r\nmeasurement monitors. The standard way to obtain information\r\nabout the internet topology is to use the traceroute tool from\r\na small number of monitors. Recent papers have made the case\r\nthat increasing the number of monitors will give a more accurate\r\nview of the topology. However, scaling up the number of monitors\r\nis not a trivial process. Duplication of effort close to the monitors\r\nwastes time by reexploring well-known parts of the network, and\r\nclose to destinations might appear to be a distributed denialof\r\nservice (DDoS) attack as the probes converge from a set of\r\nsources towards a given destination. In prior work, authors of\r\nthis report proposed Doubletree, an algorithm for cooperative\r\ntopology discovery, that reduces the load on the network, i.e.,\r\nrouter IP interfaces and end-hosts, while discovering almost\r\nas many nodes and links as standard approaches based on\r\ntraceroute. This report presents our open-source and freely\r\ndownloadable implementation of Doubletree in a tool we call\r\ntraceroute@home. We describe the deployment and validation\r\nof traceroute@home on the PlanetLab testbed and we report\r\non the lessons learned from this experience. We discuss how\r\ntraceroute@home can be developed further and discuss ideas for\r\nfuture improvements.\r\n"

     "description": "We calculate an extensive set of characteristics for Internet AS topologies extracted from the three data sources most frequently used by the research community: traceroutes, BGP, and WHOIS.  We discover that traceroute and BGP topologies are similar to one another but differ substantially from the WHOIS topology. Among the widely considered metrics, we find that the joint degree distribution appears to fundamentally characterize Internet AS topologies as well as narrowly define values for other important metrics. We discuss the interplay between the specifics of the three data collection mechanisms and the resulting topology views. In particular, we show how the data collection peculiarities explain differences in the resulting joint degree distributions of the respective topologies. Finally, we release to the community the input topology datasets, along with the scripts and output of our calculations. This supplement should enable researchers to validate their models against real data and to make more informed selection of topology data sources for their specific needs.\r\n"

,
     "datePublished": "2005.11",
     "description": "The development of realistic topology generators is a problem that has attracted significant attention the last few years. There exist a number of competing approaches to construction of random graphs reproducing important properties of real networks. Unfortunately, all the existing approaches do not capture an inherent aspect of many real networks: links in real networks represent relationships, which can be of several types reflecting different properties. Such link type inhomogeneity is present in the AS topology of the Internet, which is a intermix of customer-to- provider (c2p), peer-to-peer (p2p) and sibling-to-sibling (s2s) relationships. It also exists in social networks (different types of social relationships), in biological networks (different types of protein interactions) and in many other real networks. Node relationships not only provide additional information on the network topology structure, but more significantly, they represent an indispensable aspect of real networks, and this aspect needs to be properly modeled for many practical applications. Consider for example the case of using synthetic AS topologies to simulate a new routing protocol. In order to realistically simulate routing in a synthetic AS topology, we need to take into account how policies affect routing decisions. However, this is not possible with existing topology generators since they solely model the network connectivity properties without incorporating any insight about the relationships between nodes. In this work we address this problem by introducing a framework for modeling different relationships found in real networks. We use our framework to model AS relationships in the Internet and to develop an AS topology generator that generates AS graphs with realistic connectivity properties as well as realistic AS relationships.\r\n"

Such infections are at the root of modern scourges including DDoS extortion, on-line identity theft, SPAM, phishing, and piracy.\nHowever, the most widely used tools for gathering intelligence on new malware - network honeypots - have forced investigators to choose between monitoring activity at a large scale or capturing behavior with high fidelity. In this paper, we describe an approach to minimize this tension and improve honeypot scalability by up to six orders of magnitude while still closely emulating the execution behavior of individual Internet hosts. We have built a prototype honeyfarm system, called Potemkin, that exploits virtual machines, aggressive memory sharing, and late binding of resources to achieve this goal. While still an immature implementation, Potemkin has emulated over 64,000 Internet honeypots in live test runs, using only a handful of physical servers.\n\n"

Measuring the\r\ntopology of the Internet, analyzing the properties of Internet\r\ntopology graphs, and generating Internet-like synthetic\r\ngraphs are prominent research topics in the field. Although\r\nthe Internet AS topology has been studied extensively, less is\r\nknown about the individual ASs, the entities that comprise\r\naggregation units in the BGP routing system. In general, AS\r\nnumbers are used by service providers, companies, universities\r\nand other organizations that connect to the Internet\r\nusing BGP. However, the nature of the organizations that\r\nuse AS numbers has not been systematically investigated\r\nyet. Statistical knowledge of the ASs in the Internet is essential\r\nnot only to identifying the types of ASs that drive\r\nAS number exhaustion, but also to modeling the structure\r\nand evolution of Internet topology. In this work we initiate\r\ndevelopment of an Internet AS taxonomy by proposing an\r\ninitial classification scheme based on empirically observed\r\ndifferences among AS characteristics.\r\n"

Performance of applications and protocols, especially routing protocols, robustness of the network under attack, traffic engineering, etc., depend crucially on the topology of the network.

     "datePublished": "2005.6",
     "description": "Network topology plays a vital role in understanding the performance of\nnetwork applications and protocols.  Thus, recently there has been\ntremendous interest in generating realistic network topologies.  Such work\nmust begin with an understanding of existing network topologies, which\ntoday typically consists of a relatively small number of data sources.  In\nthis paper, we calculate an extensive set of important characteristics of\nInternet AS-level topologies extracted from the three data sources most\nfrequently used by the research community: traceroutes, BGP, and WHOIS.\nWe find that traceroute and BGP topologies are similar to one another but\ndiffer substantially from the WHOIS topology.  We discuss the\ninterplay between the properties of the data sources that result from\nspecific data collection mechanisms and the resulting topology views.  We\nfind that, among metrics widely considered, the joint degree\ndistribution appears to fundamentally characterize\nInternet AS-topologies: it narrowly defines values for other\nimportant metrics. We also introduce an evaluation criteria for the\naccuracy oftopology generators and verify previous observations that\ngenerators solely reproducing degree distributions cannot capture the\nfull spectrum of critical topological characteristics of any of the\nthree topologies. Finally, we release to the community the input\ntopology datasets, along with the scripts and output of our calculations.\nThis supplement should enable researchers to validate their models\nagainst real data and to make more informed selection of topology data\nsources for their specific needs.\n"

However, some relationships inferred by these newer algorithms are incorrect, leading to the deduction\r\nof unrealistic AS hierarchies. We investigate this problem and discover\r\nwhat causes it. Having obtained such insight, we generalize the problem\r\nof AS relationship inference as a multiobjective optimization problem\r\nwith node-degree-based corrections to the original objective function of\r\nminimizing the number of invalid paths. We solve the generalized version of the problem using the semidefinite programming relaxation of\r\nthe MAX2SAT problem. Keeping the number of invalid paths small, we\r\nobtain a more veracious solution than that yielded by recent heuristics.\r\n"

Our\n   techniques report consistent measurements when the measurer is thousands of miles, multiple hops, and tens of milliseconds away from the\n   fingerprinted device, and when the fingerprinted device is connected to the Internet from different locations and via different access\n   technologies. Further, one can apply our passive and semi-passive techniques when the fingerprinted device is behind a NAT or firewall,\n   and also when the device's system time is maintained via NTP or SNTP. One can use our techniques to obtain information about whether two\n   devices on the Internet, possibly shifted in time or IP addresses, are actually the same physical device. Example applications include:\n   computer forensics; tracking, with some probability, a physical device as it connects to the Internet from different public access\n   points; counting the number of devices behind a NAT even when the devices use constant or random IP IDs; remotely probing a block of\n   addresses to determine if the addresses correspond to virtual hosts, e.g., as part of a virtual honeynet; and unanonymizing anonymized\n   network traces.\n"

The hardcopy version published by Springer includes the deprecated version, while the electronic\r\nproceedings include this updated version.  The updated paper correctly accounts for \r\nthe specific timestamp behavior, previously unknown to the authors,\r\nof the particular version of the firmware used in the Dag GE card of our\r\nexperiments.]\r\n\r\nWe analyze delays of traceroute probes, i.e. packets that elicit ICMP\r\nTimeExceeded messages, for a full range of probe sizes up to 9000 bytes as observed\r\non unloaded high-end routers. Our ultimate motivation is to use traceroute\r\nRTTs for Internet mapping of router and PoP (ISP point-of-presence) level nodes,\r\nincluding potentially gleaning information on equipment models, link technologies,\r\ncapacities, latencies, and spatial positions. To our knowledge it is the first\r\nstudy to examine in a reliable testbed setting the detailed statistics of ICMP response\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nWe find that two fundamental assumptions about ICMP\r\nmay not hold in some cases in modern routers, namely that\r\nICMP delays are a linear function of packet size\r\nand that ICMP generation rate is equal to the capacity\r\nof the interface on which probes are received.\r\nThe primary causes of these violations appear to be\r\ninternal segmentation of packets into cells \r\nand limiting of ICMP\r\npacket rates and bit rates inside a router.\r\nOur results suggest that the linear\r\nmodel of packet delay as a function of packet size merits \r\nrevisiting for certain router models and time resolutions.\r\nOur findings also suggest possibilities of \r\ndeveloping new techniques for bandwidth estimation and \r\nrouter fingerprinting.\r\n"

     "description": "\nWe study the burstiness of TCP flows at the packet level. We\naggregate packets into entities we call \"flights\". We show, using a simple\nmodel of TCP dynamics, that delayed-acks and window dynamics would\npotentially cause flights at two different timescales in a TCP flow - the\nlower at the order of 5-10 ms (sub-RTT) and the higher at about 10 times\nthis value (order of an RTT seen by the flow). The model suggests that\nflight sizes would be small at the lower timescale, regardless of the network environment. The model also predicts that the network conditions\nrequired for the occurrence of flights at the larger timescale are either\nlarge buffers or large available bandwidths - both of which result in\na high bandwidth delay product environment. We argue that these two\nconditions indicate that the TCP flow does not operate in a congestion\ncontrol region, either because the source of traffic is unaware of congestion or because there is so much bandwidth that congestion control\nis not required. We verify our model by passive Internet measurement.\nUsing the trace files obtained, we collect statistics on flights at the two\ntimescales in terms of their frequency and size. We also find the dependence of the sizes and frequency of flights on the Internet environment in\nwhich they occurred. The results concur strongly with our hypothesis on\nthe origins of flights, leading us to the conclusion that flights are effective\nindicators of excess resource in the Internet.      "

     "description": "The development of veracious models of the Internet topology has received a lot of attention in the last few years. Many proposed\nmodels are based on topologies derived from RouteViews BGP table\ndumps (BTDs). However, BTDs do not capture all AS-links of the Internet topology and most importantly the number of the hidden AS-links\nis unknown, resulting in AS-graphs of questionable quality. As a first\nstep to address this problem, we introduce a new AS-topology discovery\nmethodology that results in more complete and accurate graphs. More\nover, we use data available from existing measurement facilities, circumventing the burden of additional measurement infrastructure. We deploy\nour methodology and construct an AS-topology that has at least 61.5%\nmore AS-links than BTD-derived AS-topologies we examined. Finally,\nwe analyze the temporal and topological properties of the augmented\ngraph and pinpoint the dierences from BTD-derived AS-topologies."

     "description": "The packet pair technique aims to estimate the capacity of a path (bottleneck bandwidth) from the dispersion of two equal-sized probing packets sent back-to-back.  It has also been argued that the dispersion of longer packet bursts (packet trains) can estimate the available bandwidth of a path.  This paper examines such packet pair and packet train dispersion techniques in depth.  First we demonstrate that, in general, packet pair bandwidth measurements follow a multimodal distribution, and explain the causes of multiple local modes.  The path capacity is a local mode, often different than the global mode of this distribution.  We illustrate the effects of network load, cross traffic packet size variability, and probing packet size on the bandwidth distribution of packet pairs.  We then switch to the dispersion of long packet trains.  The mean of the packet train dispersion distribution corresponds to a bandwidth metric that we refer to as Average Dispersion Rate (ADR).  We show that the ADR is a lower bound of the capacity and an upper bound of the available bandwidth of a path.  Putting all pieces together, we present a capacity estimation methodology that has been implemented in a tool called _pathrate_.  We report on our experiences with _pathrate_ after having measured hundreds of Internet paths over the last three years."

     "description": "Since the emergence of peer-to-peer (P2P) networking in the\r\nlate '90s, P2P applications have multiplied, evolved and established\r\nthemselves as the leading 'growth app' of Internet\r\ntraffic workload. In contrast to first-generation P2P networks\r\nwhich used well-defined port numbers, current P2P\r\napplications have the ability to disguise their existence through\r\nthe use of arbitrary ports. As a result, reliable estimates of\r\nP2P traffic require examination of packet payload, a methodological\r\nlandmine from legal, privacy, technical, logistic, and\r\nfiscal perspectives. Indeed, access to user payload is often\r\nrendered impossible by one of these factors, inhibiting trustworthy\r\nestimation of P2P traffic growth and dynamics. In\r\nthis paper, we develop a systematic methodology to identify\r\nP2P flows at the transport layer, i.e., based on connection\r\npatterns of P2P networks, and without relying on packet\r\npayload. We believe our approach is the first method for\r\ncharacterizing P2P traffic using only knowledge of network\r\ndynamics rather than any user payload. To evaluate our\r\nmethodology, we also develop a payload technique for P2P\r\ntraffic identification, by reverse engineering and analyzing\r\nthe nine most popular P2P protocols, and demonstrate its\r\nefficacy with the discovery of P2P protocols in our traces\r\nthat were previously unknown to us. Finally, our results\r\nindicate that P2P traffic continues to grow unabatedly, contrary\r\nto reports in the popular media.\r\n"

     "description": "We examine the cause of the tail of the distribution of the number of packet and byte arrivals at backbone\r\nrouters. One possible cause is that sometimes there are a large number of active connections resulting in a large\r\nnumber of arrivals in a short period of time. Another possibility is that the tail is due to one or a few very fast\r\nconnections. By examining time-stamped packet headers from several backbone links, we find that the tail is\r\nneither strictly from many users nor strictly from fast connections. Rather, at some times and some time-scales,\r\nwe find that the tail (the skewness of the distribution in particular) is strongly influenced by the tail of the\r\ndistribution of the number of active connections, while at other times, the tail of the number of arrivals is due\r\nto the tail of the distribution of the connection bit-rates.\r\n"

     "description": "Flash worms follow a precomputed spread tree using prior knowledge\r\nof all systems vulnerable to the worm's exploit. In previous\r\nwork we suggested that a flash worm could saturate one million\r\nvulnerable hosts on the Internet in under 30 seconds. We\r\ngrossly over-estimated.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we revisit the problem in the context of single\r\npacket UDP worms (inspired by Slammer and Witty). Simulating\r\na flash version of Slammer, calibrated by current Internet latency\r\nmeasurements and observed worm packet delivery rates, we show\r\nthat a worm could saturate 95% of one million vulnerable hosts on\r\nthe Internet in 510 milliseconds. A similar worm using a TCP based\r\nservice could 95% saturate in 1.3 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe speeds above are achieved with flat infection trees and packets\r\nsent at line rates. Such worms are vulnerable to recently proposed\r\nworm containment techniques. To avoid this,\r\nflash worms should slow down and use deeper, narrower trees. We\r\nexplore the resilience of such spread trees when the list of vulnerable\r\naddresses is inaccurate. Finally, we explore the implications\r\nof flash worms for containment defenses: such defenses must correlate\r\ninformation from multiple sites in order to detect the worm,\r\nbut the speed of the worm will defeat this correlation unless a certain\r\nfraction of traffic is artificially delayed in case it later proves to\r\nbe a worm.\r\n"

     "description": "One of the major hurdles limiting IPv6 adoption is the existence\r\nof poorly managed experimental IPv6 sites that negatively\r\naffect the perceived quality of the IPv6 Internet. To\r\nassist network operators in improving IPv6 networks, we are\r\nexploring methods to identify wide-area IPv6 network problems.\r\nOur approach makes use of parallel IPv4 and IPv6\r\nconnectivity to dual-stacked nodes.\r\n\r\nWe identify the existence of an IPv6 path problem by\r\ncomparing IPv6 delay measurements to IPv4 delay measurements.\r\nOur test results indicate that the majority of\r\nIPv6 paths have delay characteristics comparable to those\r\nof IPv4, although a small number of paths exhibit a much\r\nlarger delay with IPv6. Thus, we hope to improve the quality\r\nof the IPv6 Internet by identifying the worst set of problems.\r\n\r\nOur methodology is simple. We create a list of systems\r\nwith IPv6 and IPv4 addresses in actual use by monitoring\r\nDNS messages. We then measure delay to each address in order\r\nto select a few systems per site based on their IPv6:IPv4\r\nresponse-time ratios. Finally, we run traceroute with Path\r\nMTU discovery to the selected systems and then visualize\r\nthe results for comparative path analysis. This paper\r\npresents the tools used to support this study, and the results\r\nof our measurements conducted from two locations in\r\nJapan and one in Spain.\r\n"

     "description": "Network operators need to determine the composition of the traffic\r\nmix on links when looking for dominant applications, users, or\r\nestimating traffic matrices. Cisco's NetFlow has evolved into a\r\nsolution that satisfies this need by reporting flow records that\r\nsummarize a sample of the traffic traversing the link. But sampled\r\nNetFlow has shortcomings that hinder the collection and analysis\r\nof traffic data.  First, during flooding attacks router memory and\r\nnetwork bandwidth consumed by flow records can increase beyond what\r\nis available; second, selecting the right static sampling rate is\r\ndifficult because no single rate gives the right tradeoff of memory\r\nuse versus accuracy for all traffic mixes; third, the heuristics\r\nrouters use to decide when a flow is reported are a poor match to\r\nmost applications that work with time bins; finally, it is impossible\r\nto estimate without bias the number of active flows for aggregates\r\nwith non-TCP traffic.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we propose Adaptive NetFlow, deployable through an\r\nupdate to router software, which addresses many shortcomings of\r\nNetFlow by dynamically adapting the sampling rate to achieve\r\nrobustness without sacrificing accuracy. To enable counting of\r\nnon-TCP flows, we propose an optional Flow Counting Extension that\r\nrequires augmenting existing hardware at routers. Both our proposed\r\nsolutions readily provide descriptions of the traffic of progressively\r\nsmaller sizes. Transmitting these at progressively higher levels\r\nof reliability allows graceful degradation of the accuracy of traffic\r\nreports in response to network congestion on the reporting path."

     "description": "Previous research has shown that most of the DNS queries\r\nreaching the root of the hierarchy are bogus . This behavior\r\nderives from two constraints on the system: (1) queries\r\nthat cannot be satisfied locally percolate up to the root of\r\nthe DNS; (2) some caching nameservers are behind packet\r\nfilters or firewalls that allow outgoing queries but block incoming\r\nreplies. These resolvers assume the network failure is\r\ntemporary and retransmit their queries, often aggressively.\r\n\r\nDNS pollution may not be causing any perceivable performance problems. The root servers seem well equipped to\r\nhandle the load. Since DNS messages are small, the pollution\r\ndoes not contribute significantly to the total traffic\r\ngenerated by most organizations. Nonetheless, this paper\r\nprovides a few reasons why network operators should take\r\nthe time to investigate and fix these problems."

     "description": "On Friday, 19 March 2004, at approximately 8:45 p.m. Pacific Standard Time\r\n(PST), an Internet worm began to spread, targeting a buffer overflow\r\nvulnerability in several Internet Security Systems (ISS) products,\r\nincluding its RealSecure Network,\r\n\r\nRealSecure Server Sensor, RealSecure Desktop, and BlackICE. The worm took\r\nadvantage of a security flaw in these firewall applications that eEye\r\nDigital Security discovered earlier in March. Once the Witty worm--so\r\ncalled because its payload contained the phrase, \"(^.^) insert witty\r\nmessage here (^,^)\"--infects a computer, it deletes a randomly chosen\r\nsection of the hard drive, which, over time, renders the machine unusable.\r\n\r\nWhile the Witty worm is only the latest in a string of self-propagating\r\nremote exploits, it distinguishes itself through several interesting\r\nfeatures:\r\n\r\n* It was the first widely propagated Internet worm to carry a\r\ndestructive payload.\r\n* It started in an organized manner with an order of magnitude more\r\nground-zero hosts than any previous worm.\r\n* It represents the shortest known interval between vulnerability\r\ndisclosure and worm release--it began spreading the day after the ISS\r\nvulnerability was publicized.\r\n* It spread through a host population in which every compromised host\r\nwas proactive in securing its computers and networks.\r\n* It spread through a population almost an order of magnitude smaller\r\nthan that of previous worms, demonstrating worms' viability as an automated\r\nmechanism to rapidly compromise machines on the Internet, even in niches\r\nwithout a software monopoly.\r\n\r\nIn this article, we share a global view of the worm's spread, with\r\nparticular attention to these worrisome features."

In this paper, we examine the effects of the scope\r\nand locality of network telescopes on accurate measurement of both\r\npandemic incidents (the spread of an Internet worm) and endemic\r\nincidents (denial-of-service attacks) on the Internet.  In particular,\r\nwe study the relationship between the size of the network telescope\r\nand its ability to detect network events, characterize its precision\r\nin determining event duration and rate, and discuss practical\r\nconsiderations in the deployment of network telescopes.\r\n"

     "description": "IP address and TCP/UDP port scanning are\r\ncritical components of many network attacks. Such scanning\r\nallows attackers to spread a self-propagating worm or collect\r\ndetailed information about end-hosts in preparation for attacks.\r\nThis paper investigates an algorithm to detect TCP-SYN\r\nscanning. Special care is taken to detect even stealthy scanners.\r\nAttackers are detected by tracking the number of half-open\r\nconnections generated by each source. However, a source is\r\nonly tracked until it is clear that it is not currently scanning.\r\nThe computational load of this method is analyzed and it is\r\nfound that the method is not computationally intensive and\r\nis suitable for online detection of scanning even on backbone\r\nlinks. Specifically, on a backbone link investigated it was found\r\nthat the total number of sources that needs to be tracked at\r\nany one time is at most a few thousand.\r\n"

,
     "datePublished": "2004.6",
     "description": "Network operators need to determine the composition of the traffic\nmix on links when looking for dominant applications, users, or\nestimating traffic matrices. Cisco's NetFlow has evolved into a\nsolution that satisfies this need by reporting flow records that\nsummarize a sample of the traffic traversing the link. But sampled\nNetFlow has shortcomings that hinder the collection and analysis\nof traffic data.  First, during flooding attacks router memory and\nnetwork bandwidth consumed by flow records can increase beyond what\nis available; second, selecting the right static sampling rate is\ndifficult because no single rate gives the right tradeoff of memory\nuse versus accuracy for all traffic mixes; third, the heuristics\nrouters use to decide when a flow is reported are a poor match to\nmost applications that work with time bins; finally, it is impossible\nto estimate without bias the number of active flows for aggregates\nwith non-TCP traffic.\n\nIn this paper we propose Adaptive NetFlow, deployable through an\nupdate to router software, which addresses many shortcomings of\nNetFlow by dynamically adapting the sampling rate to achieve\nrobustness without sacrificing accuracy. To enable counting of\nnon-TCP flows, we propose an optional Flow Counting Extension that\nrequires augmenting existing hardware at routers. Both our proposed\nsolutions readily provide descriptions of the traffic of progressively\nsmaller sizes. Transmitting these at progressively higher levels\nof reliability allows graceful degradation of the accuracy of traffic\nreports in response to network congestion on the reporting path.\n\nNote: This technical report contains additional proofs of lemmas\nand more detailed measurement results."

     "description": "The need to service populations of high diversity in the face\nof high disparity affects all aspects of network operation: planning, routing, \nengineering, security, and accounting. We analyze diversity/disparity\nfrom the perspective of selecting a boundary between mice and elephants\nin IP traffic aggregated by route, e.g., destination AS. Our goal is to find\na concise quantifier of size disparity for IP addresses, prefixes, policy\natoms and ASes, similar to the oft-quoted 80/20 split (e.g., 80% of volume \nin 20% of sources). We define crossover as the fraction c of total\nvolume contributed by a complementary fraction 1 - c of large objects.\nStudying sources and sinks at two Tier 1 backbones and one university,\nwe find that splits of 90/10 and 95/5 are common for IP traffic. We\ncompare the crossover diversity to common analytic models for size distributions \nsuch as Pareto/Zipf. We find that AS traffic volumes (by byte)\nare top-heavy and can only be approximated by Pareto with alpha = 0.5,\nand that empirical distributions are often close to Weibull with shape\nparameter 0.2-0.3. We also find that less than 20 ASes send or receive\n50% of all traffic in both backbones' samples, a disparity that can simplify \ntraffic engineering. Our results are useful for developers of traffic\nmodels, generators and simulators, for router testers and operators of\nhigh-speed networks."

(2) How do DNS caching implementations spread the query load among a set of higher level DNS servers? To answer these questions we did case studies of workday DNS traffic at the University of California San Diego (USA), the University of Auckland (New Zealand), and the University of Colorado at Boulder (USA). We also tested various DNS caching implementations in fully controlled laboratory experiments. This paper presents the results of our analysis of real and simulated DNS traffic.

     "description": "It is well known that the performance of a TCP flow is affected by its round-trip time (RTT), i.e., the elapsed time between the instant a packet is released by the source to the instant the corresponding ack is received by the source. The distribution of RTTs can dramatically affect not only the data rates realized by individual flows sharing a link but also the utilization of Internet links. In this paper we present a comprehensive study of the RTT distribution for TCP traffic in the Internet."

,
     "datePublished": "2004.3",
     "description": "The Thorup-Zwick (TZ) compact routing scheme is the first generic stretch-3 routing scheme delivering a nearly optimal per-node memory upper bound. Using both direct analysis and simulation, we derive the stretch distribution of this routing scheme on Internet-like inter-domain topologies. By investigating the TZ scheme on random graphs with power-law node degree distributions, Pk\u0026cong;k-\u0026#947;, we find that the average TZ stretch is quite low and virtually independent of \u0026#947;. In particular, for the Internet inter-domain graph with \u0026#947;\u0026cong;2.1, the average TZ stretch is around 1.1, with up to 70% of all pairwise paths being stretch-1 (shortest possible). As the network grows, the average stretch slowly decreases. We find routing table sizes to be very small (around 50 records for 104-node networks), well below their theoretical upper bounds. Furthermore, we find that both the average shortest path length (i.e. distance) d\u0026sim; and width of the distance distribution \u0026#963; observed in the real Internet inter-AS graph have values that are very close to the minimums of the average stretch in the d\u0026sim; and \u0026#963; -directions. This leads us to the discovery of a unique critical point of the average TZ stretch as a function of d\u0026sim; and \u0026#963;. The Internet's distance distribution is located in a close neighborhood of this point. This is remarkable given the fact that the Internet inter-domain topology has evolved without any direct attention paid to properties of the stretch distribution. It suggests the average stretch function may be an indirect indicator of the optimization criteria influencing the Internet's inter-domain topology evolution.\r\n"

,
     "datePublished": "2004.3",
     "description": "Since the identification of long-range dependence in network traffic ten years ago, its consistent appearance across numerous measurement studies has largely discredited Poissonbased models. However, since that original data set was collected, both link speeds and the number of Internet-connected hosts have increased by more than three orders of magnitude. Thus, we now revisit the Poisson assumption, by studying a combination of historical traces and new measurements obtained from a major backbone link belonging to a Tier 1 ISP. We show that unlike the older data sets, current network traffic can be well represented by the Poisson model for sub-second time scales. At multi-second scales, we find a distinctive piecewise-linear non-stationarity, together with evidence of long-range dependence. Combining our observations across both time scales leads to a time-dependent Poisson characterization of network traffic that, when viewed across very long time scales, exhibits the observed long-range dependence. This traffic characterization reconciliates the seemingly contradicting observations of Poisson and long-memory traffic characteristics. It also seems to be in general agreement with recent theoretical models for large-scale traffic aggregation.\r\n"

     "description": "\nPreviously Broido and Claffy analysed the global Internet interdomain routing system based on BGP policy atoms: equivalence classes of prefixes based on common AS path as observed from a number of topological locations [6] [7]. In this report we define a variant of policy atoms, called declared atoms. Declared atoms constitute an aggregation mechanism complementary to CIDR aggregation. We describe a new routing architecture, called atomised routing, based on BGP and declared atoms. Atomised routing aims for a reduction in the number of routed objects in the default-free zone of the Internet (around 20k declared atoms covering around 113k prefixes), and an improved convergence behaviour of the interdomain routing system. We also demonstrate the viability of incremental deployment of atomised routing.\n"

     "description": "The Slammer worm spread so quickly that human response was ineffective. In January 2003, it packed a benign payload, but its disruptive capacity was surprising. Why was it so effective and what new challenges does this new breed of worm pose? \r\n\r\nSlammer (sometimes called Sapphire) was the fastest computer worm in history. As it began spreading throughout the Internet, the worm infected more than 90 percent of vulnerable hosts within 10 minutes, causing significant disruption to financial, transportation, and government institutions and precluding any human-based response. In this article, we describe how it achieved its rapid growth, dissect portions of the worm to study some of its flaws, and look at our defensive effectiveness against it and its successors.\r\n\r\nSlammer began to infect hosts slightly before 05:30 UTC on Saturday, 25 January 2003, by exploiting a buffer-overflow vulnerability in computers on the Internet running Microsoft's SQL Server or Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine (MSDE) 2000. David Litchfield of Next Generation Security Software discovered this underlying indexing service weakness in July 2002; Microsoft released a patch for the vulnerability before the vulnerability was publicly disclosed (www.microsoft.com/security/slammer.asp). Exploiting this vulnerability, the worm infected at least 75,000 hosts, perhaps considerably more, and caused network outages and unforeseen consequences such as canceled airline flights, interference with elections, and ATM failures.\r\n"

     "description": "The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical component\nof the modern Internet. It provides a critical link between\nhuman users and Internet routing infrastructure by mapping\nhost names to IP addresses. The DNS is a hierarchy\nof distributed system of servers anchored at 13 DNS root\nservers.\n\nIn this paper we examine the macroscopic connectivity\nbetween the DNS root servers and the worldwide population\nof their clients. We study the impact of the geographical\nlocations of root servers on the latency of server-client\nconnections. We also propose a methodology to estimate the\neffects of root servers' relocation.\n\nWe found that all root servers can be clustered in four\ngroups that closely correlate with their geographical positions.\nServers in the same group are nearly indistinguishable\nfor their clients in terms of latency and can replace one\nanother in providing DNS services to the clients. M-root, the\nonly root server in Asia, is in a group of its own and, therefore,\nis the most crucial for its clients in terms of the latency\nincrease in case of its unavailability. Clients in Europe appear\nto be relatively underprovisioned and may merit an additional\nroot server. Clients in North America appear overprovisioned.\nOne of the US servers may be a suitable candidate\nfor relocation to a different region of the world."

     "description": "It has been clear since 1988 that self-propagating\r\ncode can quickly spread across a network by exploiting homoge-neous\r\nsecurity vulnerabilities. However, the last few years have\r\nseen a dramatic increase in the frequency and virulence of such\r\n\"worm\" outbreaks. For example, the Code-Red worm epidemics\r\nof 2001 infected hundreds of thousands of Internet hosts in a very\r\nshort period - incurring enormous operational expense to track\r\ndown, contain, and repair each infected machine. In response\r\nto this threat, there is considerable effort focused on developing\r\ntechnical means for detecting and containing worm infections\r\nbefore they can cause such damage.\r\n\r\nThis paper does not propose a particular technology to address\r\nthis problem, but instead focuses on a more basic question: How\r\nwell will any such approach contain a worm epidemic on the\r\nInternet? We describe the design space of worm containment\r\nsystems using three key parameters- reaction time, contain-ment\r\nstrategy and deployment scenario. Using a combination of\r\nanalytic modeling and simulation, we describe how each of these\r\ndesign factors impacts the dynamics of a worm epidemic and,\r\nconversely, the minimum engineering requirements necessary to\r\ncontain the spread of a given worm. While our analysis cannot\r\nprovide definitive guidance for engineering defenses against all\r\nfuture threats, we demonstrate the lower bounds that any such\r\nsystem must exceed to be useful today. Unfortunately, our results\r\nsuggest that there are significant technological and administrative\r\ngaps to be bridged before an effective defense can be provided\r\nin today's Internet.\r\n"

Bandwidth estimation is of interest to users wishing to optimize end-to-end transport performance, overlay network routing, and peer-to-peer file distribution. Techniques for accurate bandwidth estimation are also important for traffic engineering and capacity planning support. Existing bandwidth estimation tools measure one or more of three related metrics: capacity, available bandwidth, and bulk transfer capacity (BTC). Currently available bandwidth estimation tools employ a variety of strategies to measure these metrics. In this survey we review the recent bandwidth estimation literature focusing on underlying techniques and methodologies as well as open source bandwidth measurement tools.\n"

     "description": "Traceroute IP paths are often used in studies of Internet topology and\r\nrouting.  Though producing one of the best available router-level maps\r\nof forward paths, traceroute is susceptible to several types of\r\ninaccuracies.  However, no one to date has quantified the magnitude of\r\nthese inaccuracies in real-world traceroute paths.  We make an initial\r\nattempt by reporting on the observed frequency of one type of\r\ninaccuracy---third-party addresses.  A third-party address is the\r\naddress of a router interface that does not lie in the actual path\r\ntaken by packets.  Based on an examination of thousands of\r\ntraceroute paths from six locations worldwide and the application of\r\nseveral metrics, we find that the situations in which third-party\r\naddresses can occur to be relatively uncommon.  They mostly occur\r\nwithin a few hops of the destination (that is, at the destination\r\nedge of the network), with multihoming being their most likely cause.\r\nOur conclusion is that third-party addresses cannot be a significant\r\nsource of AS map distortions.\r\n"

     "description": "Researchers investigating topics such as performance, stability, and\ngrowth of the Internet often turn to BGP routing tables to obtain\nInternet topology.  BGP routing tables provide a mapping from address\nprefixes to autonomous system (AS) paths.  Our study, based on\nhundreds of thousands of traceroutes from three locations worldwide,\ncategorizes differences between AS paths obtained from BGP routing\ntables and AS paths derived from traceroute paths.  We find much of\nthe disparity results from 'exchange points ASes' (which rarely appear\nin BGP paths) and by groups of 'ASes under the same ownership'.  We\nintroduce a new AS relationship, 'common ownership', that reflects the\ncomplexities of real-world business relationships and practices.  We\nconjecture that the observed difference in size between the cores of\nan AS graph derived from BGP and an AS graph derived from traceroute\nis due to the visibility of peering at exchange points in traceroute\npaths.\n"

Using passive OC-12 monitors we observe multicast\ntraffic on links connecting aggregated customers and peer\nnetworks to our native multicast backbone network. We first\nrefine existing traffic flow profiling methodologies via an exploration of temporal differences in multicast packet trains.\nBased on this framework we collect multicast flow traces\nfrom four geographically dispersed nodes in the network\nover a one-month period. We present multicast-specific traffic patterns and characteristics including: packet and flow\nsize distributions, packet duplication, packet fragmentation,\naddress accumulation and address space distributions. We\nalso analyze the distribution of sources per multicast group\nand the implications of our observations on the applicability\nof emerging single-source protocols. Analysis reveals results\ncontrary to prevailing wisdom, including: (i) a preponderance of single-packet flows; (ii) a highly variable packet size\ndistribution, with many large packets and strong modes; (iii) \nthe existence of fragmented multicast traffic; and (iv) an insignificant number of simultaneous multiple-source groups.\nBased on our analysis, we recommend policies for deployment and improvements to protocol implementations.\n"

,
     "datePublished": "2003.1",
     "description": "The Sapphire Worm was the fastest computer worm in history.  As it\r\nbegan spreading throughout the Internet, it doubled in size every 8.5\r\nseconds.  It infected more than 90 percent of vulnerable hosts within\r\n10 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe worm (also called Slammer) began to infect hosts slightly\r\nbefore 05:30 UTC on Saturday, January 25.  Sapphire exploited a\r\nbuffer overflow vulnerability in computers on the Internet running\r\nMicrosoft's SQL Server or MSDE 2000 (Microsoft SQL Server Desktop\r\nEngine).  This weakness in an underlying indexing service was\r\ndiscovered in July 2002; Microsoft released a patch for the\r\nvulnerability before it was announced. The worm\r\ninfected at least 75,000 hosts, perhaps considerably more, and caused\r\nnetwork outages and such unforeseen consequences as canceled airline\r\nflights, interference with elections, and ATM failures.  Several\r\ndisassembled versions of the source code of the worm are\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nPropagation speed was Sapphire's novel feature: in the first minute, the infected population doubled in size every 8.5 (\u0026plusmn;1) seconds. The worm achieved its full scanning rate (over 55 million scans per second) after approximately three minutes, after which the rate of growth slowed down somewhat because significant portions of the network did not have enough bandwidth to allow it to operate unhindered. Most vulnerable machines were infected within 10-minutes of the worm's release. Although worms with this rapid propagation had been predicted on theoretical grounds, the spread of Sapphire provides the first real incident demonstrating the capabilities of a high-speed worm. By comparison, it was two orders magnitude faster than the Code Red worm, which infected over 359,000 hosts on July 19th, 2001. In comparison, the Code Red worm population had a leisurely doubling time of about 37 minutes. \r\n\r\nWhile Sapphire did not contain a malicious payload, it caused considerable harm simply by overloading networks and taking database servers out of operation. Many individual sites lost connectivity as their access bandwidth was saturated by local copies of the worm and there were several reports of Internet backbone disruption (although most backbone providers appear to have remained stable throughout the epidemic). It is important to realize that if the worm had carried a malicious payload, had attacked a more widespread vulnerability, or had targeted a more popular service, the effects would likely have been far more severe. \r\n\r\nThis document is a preliminary analysis of the Sapphire worm, principally focused on determining the speed and scope of its spread and the mechanisms that were used to achieve this result. \r\n"

These sources include\na university commodity access link, two highly aggregated\ncommercial exchange points, and a local NAP. Although\nthere is no practical method of ascertaining whether any\ndata provide a representative sample of all Internet traffic,\nwe include data sources that cover several different types\nof WANs with traffic from commercial entities, educational\nand research institutions, and large government facilities.\n\nThe dominant causes of fragmentation are streaming media\nand tunneled traffic.

     "datePublished": "2002.11",
     "description": "On July 19, 2001, more than 359,000 computers\r\nconnected to the Internet were infected with the Code-Red\r\n(CRv2) worm in less than 14 hours. The cost of this\r\nepidemic, including subsequent strains of Code-Red, is estimated\r\nto be in excess of $2.6 billion. Despite the global\r\ndamage caused by this attack, there have been few serious\r\nattempts to characterize the spread of the worm, partly\r\ndue to the challenge of collecting global information about\r\nworms. Using a technique that enables global detection of\r\nworm spread, we collected and analyzed data over a period\r\nof 45 days beginning July 2nd, 2001 to determine the characteristics\r\nof the spread of Code-Red throughout the Internet.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we describe the methodology we use to trace\r\nthe spread of Code-Red, and then describe the results of our\r\ntrace analyses. We first detail the spread of the Code-Red\r\nand CodeRedII worms in terms of infection and deactivation\r\nrates. Even without being optimized for spread of infection,\r\nCode-Red infection rates peaked at over 2,000 hosts per\r\nminute. We then examine the properties of the infected host\r\npopulation, including geographic location, weekly and diurnal\r\ntime effects, top-level domains, and ISPs. We demonstrate\r\nthat the worm was an international event, infection activity\r\nexhibited time-of-day effects, and found that, although\r\nmost attention focused on large corporations, the Code-Red\r\nworm primarily preyed upon home and small business users.\r\nWe also qualified the effects of DHCP on measurements of\r\ninfected hosts and determined that IP addresses are not an\r\naccurate measure of the spread of a worm on timescales\r\nlonger than 24 hours. Finally, the experience of the Code-Red\r\nworm demonstrates that wide-spread vulnerabilities in\r\nInternet hosts can be exploited quickly and dramatically,\r\nand that techniques other than host patching are required\r\nto mitigate Internet worms.\r\n"

We describe a\nmethod of measuring the size and lifetime of Internet streams, and use this\nmethod to characterise traffic distributions at two different sites.\nWe find that although most streams (about 45% of them) are dragonflies,\nlasting less than 2 seconds, a significant number of streams have lifetimes\nof hours to days, and can carry a high proportion (50% to 60%) of the total\nbytes on a given link. We define tortoises as streams that last longer than\n15 minutes. We point out that streams can be classified not only by lifetime\n(dragonflies and tortoises) but also by size (mice and elephants), and note\nthat stream size and lifetime are independent dimensions.\nWe submit that Service Providers (ISPs) need to be aware of the distribution\nof Internet stream sizes, and the impact of the difference in behaviour\nbetween short and long streams. In particular any forwarding cache mechanisms\nin Internet routers must be able to cope with a high volume of short\nstreams. In addition ISPs should realise that Long-Running (LR) streams\ncan contribute a significant fraction of their packet and byte volumes --\nsomething they may not have allowed for when using traditional 'flat rate\nuser bandwidth consumption' approaches to provisioning and engineering.\n"

     "name": "Replication Strategies for Highly Available Peer-to-Peer Storage "
,
     "datePublished": "2002.5",
     "description": "In the past few years, peer-to-peer networks have become an extremely popular mechanism\r\nfor large-scale content sharing. Unlike traditional client-server applications,\r\nwhich centralize the management of data in a few highly reliable servers, peer-to-peer\r\nsystems distribute the burden of data storage, computation, communications and administration\r\namong thousands of individual client workstations. While the popularity\r\nof this approach, exemplified by systems such as Gnutella, was driven by the\r\npopularity of unrestricted music distribution, newer work has expanded the potential\r\napplication base to generalized distributed file systems, persistent anonymous\r\npublishing, as well as support for high-quality video distribution. The widespread\r\nattraction of the peer-to-peer model arises primarily from its potential for both\r\nlow-cost scalability and enhanced availability. Ideally a peer-to-peer system could ef-\r\nficiently multiplex the resources and connectivity of its workstations across all of its\r\nusers while at the same time protecting its users from transient or persistent failures in\r\na subset of its components.\r\n\r\nHowever, these goals are not trivially engineered. First-generation peer-to-peer\r\nsystems, such as Gnutella, scaled poorly due to the overhead in locating content within\r\nthe network. Consequently, developing efficient lookup algorithms has consumed most\r\nof the recent academic work in this area. The challenges in providing high\r\navailability to such systems is more poorly understood and only now being studied.\r\nIn particular, unlike traditional distributed systems, the individual components of a\r\npeer-to-peer system experience an order of magnitude worse availability -- individually\r\nadministered workstations may be turned on and off, join and leave the system, have intermittent\r\nconnectivity, and are constructed from low-cost low-reliability components.\r\nOne recent study of a popular peer-to-peer file sharing system found that the majority\r\nof peers had application-level availability rates of under 20 percent.\r\n\r\nAs a result, all peer-to-peer systems must employ some form of replication to provide\r\nacceptable service to their users. In systems such as Gnutella, this replication\r\noccurs implicitly as each file downloaded by a user is implicitly replicated at the user's\r\nworkstation. However, since these systems do not explicitly manage replication or\r\nmask failures, the availability of an object is fundamentally linked to its popularity and\r\nusers have to repeatedly access different replicas until they find one on an available\r\nhost. Next-generation peer-to-peer storage systems, such as the Cooperative File System\r\n(CFS), recognize the need to mask failures from the user and implement a basic\r\nreplication strategy that is independent of the user workload.\r\n\r\nWhile most peer-to-peer systems employ some form of data redundancy to cope\r\nwith failure, these solutions are not well-matched to the underlying host failure distribution\r\nor the level of availability desired by users. Consequently, it remains unclear\r\nwhat availability guarantees can be made using existing systems, or conversely how to\r\nbest achieve a desired level of availability using the mechanisms available.\r\n\r\nIn our work we are exploring replication strategy design trade-offs along several\r\ninterdependent axes: Replication granularity, replica placement, and application characteristics,\r\neach of which we address in subsequent sections. The closest analog to our\r\nwork is that of Weatherspoon and Kubiatowicz who compare the availability provided\r\nby erasure coding and whole file replication under particular failure assumptions.\r\nThe most critical differences between this work and our own revolve around the failure\r\nmodel. In particular,Weatherspoon and Kubiatowicz focus on disk failure as the dominant\r\nfactor in data availability and consequently miss the distinction between short and\r\nlong time scales that is critical to deployed peer-to-peer systems. Consequently, their\r\nmodel is likely to overestimate true file availability in this environment.\r\n"

     "description": "We analyze the evolution of the global Internet interdomain routing system on AS, prefix and IP address level granularities,\nusing snapshots of RouteViews BGP tables from 1997 to 2001. We introduce the notion of semiglobally routed\nprefixes, those present in the majority of backbone tables, and classify them into standalone -- those which have no subsets,\nno supersets; root -- have subsets, but no supersets; and subset, or more specific, which are subsets of other blocks.\n\nUsing these distinctions we find that from 1999 to 2001 many measures of routing system complexity demonstrated\nstability in the form of slow growth, dynamic equilibrium, and occasional contraction.\n\nWe find that many net change measures reflect contributions of opposite sign, and that true measure of variation, or\nchurn, is the sum of their absolute magnitudes rather than the difference. Appearance and disappearance of prefixes, ASes\nand RouteViews peers, as well as status changes (an AS changing from transit to non-transit, or a prefix shifting from a\nstandalone prefix to a root prefix) are instances of routing system churn. One advantage of using our notion of semiglobal\nprefixes is that they exhibit less churn than global prefixes (those prefixes common to all backbone tables) and as such\nallow for derivation of more robust macroscopic statistics about the routing system.\n\nWe study route prefix instability at a medium time granularity for late 2001 using 2-hour snapshots of BGP tables,\nand find that half of all prefix reannouncements (flips) are contributed by 1% of all ASes, with government networks,\ntelecoms in developing countries and major backbone ISPs at the top of the list of instability contributors. Small ASes\n(those who originate only a few prefixes into the global routing system) do not contribute more than their fair share of\neither route entries or churn to the global routing system. We conclude that during 1999-2001 many Internet metrics were\nstable, and that the routing system's growth and instability are mostly caused by large and medium-sized ISPs.\n"

The root and top level domain (TLD) nameservers form the\r\nhighest level of authority over the Internet naming hierarchy, and are thus\r\npotentially involved in reaching any and every URL or email address we seek.\r\nWe use passive measurements to analyze performance of these critical\r\nnameservers from a client network's viewpoint.\r\n\r\nWe use NeTraMet meters on a university campus to take passive measurements of\r\nDNS response time, request loss rate and request load to the root and gTLD\r\n(generic top level domain, e.g., .com, .net, .org) servers.\r\n\r\nFrom these measurements we produce strip charts that are useful for day-to-day\r\nmonitoring of one's Internet connectivity, since they reveal changes in\r\nnetwork behaviour on paths between one's local network and the global servers\r\nwithout the need to actively inject traffic into the network.  We are\r\ndeveloping a monitoring tool to produce such plots in near real time.\r\n"

     "description": "We describe active measurements of topology and end-to-end latency characteristics between several of the DNS root servers and a subset of their clients using the skitter tool developed by CAIDA.  We gather a sample of clients for each monitored DNS root server, combine these samples into a common target list and then actively probe these targets and analyze their\nconnectivity. \nWe identify the subsets of destinations that have large latency connections to all\ninstrumented root name servers and discuss their geographical make-up. Our goal is to build an\nanalytical framework for evaluating the optimality of root server placement and its impact on the\nefficiency of the DNS service. The skitter tool and the methodology we propose can also be used\nfor monitoring the end-to-end performance in large networks and for assessing the optimality of\nweb servers placement in general.\n"

     "description": "Until now, system administrators have lacked a flexible real-time network\ntraffic flow monitoring package.  Such a package must provide a wide\nrange of services but remain flexible enough for rapid in-house\ncustomizations.  Existing passive data collection tools are typically\nnarrow in scope, designed for specific tasks from packet capture\n(tcpdump) to accounting (NeTraMet). In response, CAIDA has created the\nCoralReef suite designed to provide network administrators and\nreserachers with a consistent interface for a wide range of network\nanalysis applications, from raw capture to flows analysis to real-time\nreport generation.  CoralReef provides a convenient set of passive data\ntools for a diverse audience.\n\nCoralReef is a package of device drivers, libraries, classes, and\napplications.  We briefly outline the architecture and provide relevant case\nstudies and examples of CoralReef's use as applied to real-world networking\nsituations.  We will show how CoralReef is a powerful, extensible, and\nconvenient package for network monitoring and reporting.\n"

The root\nof the DNS distributed database is managed by 13 root nameservers.  We\npassively measure the performance of one of them: F.root-servers.net.\n\nThese measurements show an astounding number of bogus queries: from\n60-85% of observed queries were repeated from the same host within the\nmeasurement interval.  Over 14% of a root server's query load is due to\nqueries that violate the DNS specification.  Denial of service attacks using\nroot servers are common and occurred throughout our measurement period (7-24\nJan 2001). Though not targeted at the root servers, DOS attacks often use root\nservers as reflectors toward a victim network.  We contrast our observations\nwith those found in an earlier study of DNS rootserver performance by\nDanzig et al.\n"

In this paper we examine\r\nthe causes and attributes of measured fragment traffic and\r\ncontrast those results with commonly cited beliefs. In particular,\r\nthe effects of NFS, streaming media, networked video\r\ngames, and tunneled traffic are quantified, and we estimate\r\nthe prevalence of packet fragmentation due to improperly\r\nconfigured machines.\r\nTo understand the prevalence, causes, and effects of fragmented\r\nIP traffic, we have collected and analyzed seven\r\nmulti-day traces from three sources. These sources include a\r\nuniversity commodity access link, a highly aggregated commercial\r\nexchange point, and a local NAP. Although there\r\nis no practical method of ascertaining whether any data\r\nprovide a representative sample of all Internet traffic, we\r\ndo include data sources that cover several different types\r\nof WANs with traffic from commercial entities, educational\r\nand research institutions, and large government facilities.\r\n"

Sensitive to engineering resource limitations of router memory\nand CPU cycles, we focus on techniques to estimate redundancy of the merged tables, in particular how many entries\nare essential for complete and correct routing.\n\nWe introduced the notion of policy atoms as part\nof a calculus in routing table analysis. We found that the\nnumber of atoms and individual counts of atoms with a given\nnumber of prefixes properly scale with the Internet's growth\nand with filtering of prefixes by length. We show that the\nuse of atoms can potentially reduce the number of route\nannouncements by a factor of two, with all routing policies\nbeing preserved. Atoms thus represent Internet properties\nin an accurate way, yet with much smaller complexity.\n\nSeveral of our analysis results suggest that commonly\nheld Internet engineering beliefs require re-consideration.\nWe find that more specific routes had a relatively constant\nshare of routes in backbone tables across 2000/2001. On\nthe other hand, the churn of more specific routes was much\nlarger than that of top prefixes. We also find that deaggregation of existing announcements is a second major source\n(beyond announcement of recently allocated address space)\nof new top (least specific) prefixes in global BGP tables.\nWe also provide examples of misconguration and noise in\nBGP data, including multi-origin prefixes, AS paths with\napparent routing loops (some of them due to typographical\nerrors, other actual loops undetected by local BGP speakers), inadvertent transit through customer ASes.\n"

     "description": "Passive data collection tools have traditionally been designed for\nspecific tasks such as accounting (NeTraMet) or packet capture (tcpdump).\n[The CoralReef suite](https://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/coralreef/) was\ndesigned to provide a uniform interface to passive data for a wide range of\napplications: from raw capture to real-time report generation. CoralReef\nprovides convenient set of passive data tools for a diverse audience, from\nnetwork administrators to researchers.\n\nThe CoralReef architecture is based on a toolbox paradigm. The base\nprogramming interface is implemented in a C library named libcoral. In\norder to allow users to write a single program to access many data sources,\nlibcoral provides a consistent API for capture cards from multiple\nproviders on ATM, POS, and 10-100-1000 ethernet capture cards from multiple\nvendors, as well as pcap interfaces. In addition, libcoral provides a\nconsistent interface to many packet capture file formats including: all\ncoral formats (NLANR formats included), pcap, DAG ATM, and DAG POS. This\nAPI satisfies an important design goal of providing multiple ways to\napproach the same problem. The libcoral API can operate on ATM cells,\nblocks of cells, or network packets, one at a time or via callbacks; the\napplication developer can use whichever is most convenient. NeTraMet and\nVern Paxson's Bro are two applications that have been adapted to use the\nCoral API. To facilitate rapid prototyping and development, another design\ngoal is to provide the same interface in C/C\u002b\u002b and Perl. Because the Perl\nmodule CRL.pm directly calls the C routines, Perl scripts using CRL.pm\nperform well enough for many data analysis applications. Additional\nlibraries and modules have been provided to perform more complex tasks.\nThere are libraries and Perl modules for doing AS lookups from BGP routing\ntables and others for determining geographic locations via NetGeo.\nCoralReef includes modules for the storage and manipulation of frequently\ncollected data including: source and destination hosts, IP protocols,\nports, and amounts of traffic in bytes, packets and flows. These modules\nprovide methods to automatically aggregate data into other table types and\nallow for efficiently selecting those entries that generate the most\ntraffic. For example, it is possible to convert an AS table of byte/packet\ncounts into a country table with a single method call. Higher level\napplications are written using these building blocks, so that for example\ncreating an IP or AS matrix is accomplished with just a small Perl program,\nwhile larger programs (such as the realtime report generator t2_report) are\nmore complex arrangements of the same building blocks."

Although\nthere is no practical method of ascertaining whether any\ndata provide a representative sample of all Internet traffic,\nwe include data sources that cover several different types\nof WANs with traffic from commercial entities, educational\nand research institutions, and large government facilities.\n\nThe dominant causes of fragmentation are streaming media\nand tunneled traffic.

To provide macroscopic insights into Internet topololgy and performance, the Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) has developed and deployed the skitter tool to dynamically discover and depict global Internet topology and measure performance across specific paths.  We are developing a systematic approach to visualizing the multi-dimensional parameter space covered by skitter measurements aggregated on a daily basis.

This paper extends RTFM's view of traffic by adding two further concepts, _streams_ and _torrents_. Streams are individual IP sessions (e.g. TCP or UDP) between ports on pairs of hosts, while a torrent refers to all traffic on a link. \r\n\r\nWe present stream measurement work using a meter located at UCSD (University of California, San Diego) to measure response times for DNS requests to the global root and gTLD nameservers. This example shows how to configure NeTraMet to collect flow data for stream-based flow metrics, and demonstrates the usefulness of global DNS response plots for network operations."

     "description": "The packet pair technique estimates the capacity of a path\r\n(bottleneck bandwidth) from the dispersion (spacing) experienced by\r\ntwo back-to-back packets. We demonstrate that the dispersion of\r\npacket pairs in loaded paths follows a multimodal distribution, and\r\ndis-cuss the queueing effects that cause the multiple modes. We\r\nshow that the path capacity is often not the global mode, and so it\r\ncannot be estimated using standard statistical procedures. The\r\neffect of the size of the probing packets is also investigated,\r\nshowing that the conventional wisdom of using maximum sized packet\r\npairs is not optimal. We then study the dispersion of long packet\r\ntrains. Increasing the length of the packet train reduces the\r\nmeasurement variance, but the estimates converge to a value,\r\nreferred to as Asymptotic Dispersion Rate (ADR), that is lower than\r\nthe capacity. We derive the effect of the cross traffic in the\r\ndispersion of long packet trains, showing that the ADR is not the\r\navailable bandwidth in the path, as was assumed in previous work.\r\nPutting all the pieces together, we present a capacity estimation\r\nmethodology that has been implemented in a tool called pathrate."

To improve the routing system, we need to understand better how it works now, starting with calibrating various methods used to analyze routing dynamics today. The workshop agenda first covered public sources of global routing data and simple growth curves of routes, address space, and AS number utilization. We then focused on uses of this data for routing modeling and analysis, including applications to traffic engineering. We had a session on analysis of massive topology data sets, and on tools for simulating very large (million-node) networks. The final session was a special interlude on techniques for bandwidth estimation. In this report we'll briefly capture the main points from each speaker, and then summarize highlights and results from the workshop perceived by the participants."

     "description": "\n\nAn understanding of certain network functions is critical for suc-\ncessful network management. Managers must have insight into net-\nwork topology, protocol performance and fault detection/isolation.\nThe ability to obtain such insight iseven more critical when try-\ning to support evolving technologies like multicast. With these\ntechnologies, the pace of change is high, modifications to routing\nmechanisms are frequent, and faults are common. In this paper we\nintroduce Mantra, a tool we have developed to monitor multicast.\nMantra collects, analyzes, and visualizes network-layer (routing and\ntopology) data about the global multicast infrastructure. The two\nmost important functions of Mantra are: (1) monitoring multicast\nnetworks on a global scale; and (2) presenting results in the form\nof intuitive visualizations. To achieve accurate monitoring, Mantra\ncollects data from several topologically and geographically diverse\nnetworks. For the purpose of presentation, Mantra uses several in-\nteractive visualization mechanisms to present statistics, topology\nmaps and geographic properties. Another noteworthy feature of\nMantra is its exible and scalable architecture. This architecture\nhelps keep our monitoring erts current with the fast pace of mul-\nticast developments. It also enables us to expand Mantra's moni-\ntoring scope to more networks and larger data sets.\n\n"

     "description": "When your packets travel through the Internet, where exactly do they\r\ngo? How many users of your web site live in Europe? How will your\r\nInternet service be affected by a new trans-pacific cable? To answer\r\nthese questions you need geographic information. Internet researchers\r\nfrequently need to map their observed data to specific places. But IP\r\naddresses, Autonomous System numbers, and hostnames are values in a\r\nlogical hierarchy; they contain no geographic information.  There is no\r\nauthoritative database for mapping these identifiers to locations, so\r\nseveral sources of network information must be used, and these sources\r\nmay be conflicting or incomplete. The large size of the typical data\r\nset used in Internet research makes manually mapping many thousands of\r\nIP addresses to locations impractical and imprecise; an automated\r\nsolution is required. In this paper we describe NetGeo, a tool that\r\novercomes these obstacles.\r\n\r\nNetGeo is a tool that maps IP addresses, domain names, and Autonomous\r\nSystem (AS) numbers to geographic locations. NetGeo has significant\r\npotential to support a variety of tasks: automatic selection of\r\ngeographically nearby mirror sites; ISP decisions on where to deploy\r\nnew infrastructure, traffic flow analysis for tariff policy research;\r\nregionally-based advertising design, etc. NetGeo is currently being\r\nused both in a graphical traceroute tool and for studies of\r\nconnectivity and traffic flow between countries.\r\n\r\nNetGeo can be accessed interactively via the web and through Java and\r\nPerl APIs. The NetGeo back-end consists of a database and a collection\r\nof Perl scripts for address parsing and heuristic analysis of whois\r\nrecords. To reduce the load on whois servers and to improve\r\nperformance, NetGeo caches geographic information parsed from previous\r\nqueries.\r\n\r\nPrior to the development of NetGeo, Internet geographic information was\r\nnot easily available. We look forward to many creative uses of this\r\ntool as researchers become aware of its availability.\r\n\r\n"

The reasons\nderive from the Internet's evolution as a composition of independently\ndeveloped and deployed (and by no means synergistic) protocols,\ntechnologies, and core applications. Moreover, this evolution, though\n\"punctuated\" by new technologies, has experienced no equilibrium thus\nfar.\n\nThe state of the art, or lack thereof, in high-speed measurement is\nneither surprising nor profound. It is a natural consequence of the\neconomic imperatives in the current industry, where empirically\ngrounded research in wide-area Internet modeling has been an obvious\ncasualty. Specifically, the engineering know-how required to develop\nadvanced measurement technologies, whether in software or hardware, is\nessentially the same skill set required to develop advanced routing and\nswitching capabilities. Since the latter draw far greater interest, and\nprofit, from the marketplace, it is where the industry allocates\nengineering talent.\n\nA common complaint about traffic measurement studies is that they do\nnot sustain relevance in this environment where traffic, technology,\nand topology change faster than we can measure them. Moreover, the\nproliferation of media and protocols make the acquisition of traffic\ndata almost prohibitively complicated and costly. And finally, the time\nrequired to analyze and validate data means that most research efforts\nare obsolete by the time findings are published.\n\nThus, far from having an analytic handle on the Internet, we lack in\nmost cases the ability even to measure traffic at a granularity that\nwould enable infrastructure-level research. As a result, while the core\nof the Internet continues its rapid evolution, measurement and modeling\nof it progress at a leisurely pace.\n\n"

     "description": "For the last several years, the Internet multicast backbone has been a growing part of the Internet infrastructure, and of strategic interest to the network research community experimenting with\r\nmulticast technologies. In particular, the MBONE has been a deployment testbed for scalable distribution of group audio and video streams. Rapid growth in topology and traffic volume of the\r\nmulticast infrastructure has brought inevitable scaling problems, not the least of which is the increased negative impact incurred by accidental misconfiguration of MBONE nodes. In pursuit of\r\ninsight into the MBONE topology, its growth characteristics, and the extent of the transition from the tunnel-based architecture to the deployment of native multicast, we developed and applied\r\nvisualization tools to the database of connectivity information collected with the mwatch [MWAT] utility from University College London. We have used two separate visualization tools for this\r\ntask: MantaRay [MANTA], for geographic-map based depiction of MBONE data collected by mrinfo queries; and otter [OTTER], for topological visualizations of the same data. \r\n\r\nMantaRay and Otter are part of the fleet of tools from the Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) for visualizing various sets of Internet data. Both tools are Java-based\r\nand allow users to select parts of the data, focus or zoom in on particular areas, color by various parameters, and generally explore multicast topologies. \r\n\r\n"

We have used Otter to visualize: multicast\r\nand unicast topology databases, core BGP routing tables, reachability\r\nand delay measurements, SNMP data, and web site directory structures.\r\nOtter's strength is in its data independence: it can handle any\r\nformatted data set consisting of links and nodes.\r\n\r\nOtter achieves its versatility in what data it can process by using a\r\ndata format specification prepended to each input file. This\r\nspecification stipulates attributes of each object in the data file,\r\nwhich Otter uses to tailor its visualizations and even adapt its user\r\ninterface to a specific data domain. We describe and provide examples\r\nof Otter's visualization features, how it achieves data independence,\r\npresent case studies of Otter's utility in practice, and outline\r\npossible future directions for Otter.\r\n\r\n"

Routing data includes data from Border Gateway Protocol\r\n(BGP) routing tables, which reflect the transit relationships between\r\nindividual Autonomous Systems (ASes) at a given point in time.

     "description": "As the [NLANR Caching Hierarchy](http://ircache.nlanr.net), has\r\nincreased in size and complexity, researchers and users have had a more\r\ndifficult time depicting a comprehensive view of the overall topology.\r\n[Planet Cache](http://ircache.nlanr.net/Cache/cacheviz.html) was one of\r\nthe first attempts at visualizing the hierarchy, but was not\r\nsufficiently flexible to customize views of subsets of the topology by\r\nspecific attributes. CAIDA has expanded Planet Cache's visualization to\r\ninclude both topological and geographical depictions of the hierarchy.\r\nWe have also invested in converting from VRML to a Java implementation\r\nto facilitate more interactive visualization. Our Java implementation\r\nallows the user to tailor the complexity, focus, and topological layout\r\nto match their specific visualization objectives. This ability to\r\ncustomize the visualization, combined with the universal availability\r\nthat the web and Java provide, allows a much larger set of users to\r\naccess data on the global caching infrastructure and gain insight into\r\ntheir own position in the hierarchy. While our goal is a universally\r\naccessible visualization tool, problems with the platform independence\r\nof Java and privacy sensitivities with respect to transcribing even\r\nlogical topology information have resulted in our rendering some of the\r\nmore useful aspects of the visualization only in standalone\r\n('non-applet') mode.\r\n\r\nDespite these drawbacks, the user-friendly interface and the visually\r\ninformative and dynamic nature of both the standalone and the applet\r\nversion are vast improvements over currently available tools, and\r\nprovide a good basis for future analysis.\r\n\r\n"

     "description": "The Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) would\nlike to take this opportunity to comment on the quality of the data\nunderlying evaluation of the proposed MCI-Worldcom merger. CAIDA is a\ncollaborative undertaking by industry and government to promote greater\ncooperation in the engineering and maintenance of a robust, scalable\nglobal Internet infrastructure. CAIDA provides a neutral framework for\ncompetitors to work together to address current and future operational\nand engineering requirements of the commercial Internet. CAIDA's\ncurrent focus is on developing and deploying traffic measurement and\nanalysis tools to support engineering level decision-making and related\ncollaborations.\n\nThe views presented below concern the inadequacies of the data upon\nwhich the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is basing its\nInternet-related decisions and the industry-wide failure to acquire and\nanalyze basic traffic statistics in support of business, operational,\nand regulatory decisions affecting the Internet. We [CAIDA] are not\nqualified to reflect on the economic merits or business implications of\nthe proposed merger, and question the ability of any party, including\nthe FCC, to make thoughtful decisions in this matter given the poor\nquality of the data and analyses associated with the commercial\nInternet.\n\nThe lack of reliable traffic information is ubiquitous in the Internet\nsector. The absence of detailed engineering-level data directly affects\nthe quality of Internet service providers' operational and capacity\ndecisions, the ability of government to make well-reasoned regulatory\nand economic decisions, and the ability of Internet hardware and\nsoftware vendors to develop adequate specifications for future\nproducts. The current MCI-Worldcom discussions provide an important\nopportunity for the FCC, as well as the Internet service providers and\nsuppliers, to take steps to ensure that future decisions will be based\non a detailed understanding of the facts and trends underpinning this\nstrategic industry.\n\n"

     "description": "We present a case study of visualizing the global topology of \r\nthe Internet MBone. The MBone is the Internet's multicast backbone. Multicast is \r\nthe most efficient way of distributing data from one sender to multiple \r\nreceivers with minimal packet duplication. Developed and initially deployed by \r\nresearchers within the Internet community, the MBone has been extremely popular \r\nfor efficient transmission across the Internet of real-time video and audio \r\nstreams such as conferences, meetings, congressional sessions, and NASA shuttle \r\nlaunches. The MBone, like the Internet itself, grew exponentially with no \r\ncentral authority. The resulting suboptimal topology is of growing concern to \r\nnetwork providers and the multicast research community. \r\n\r\nWe create a geographic representation of the tunnel structure as arcs on a \r\nglobe by resolving the latitude and longitude of MBone routers. The interactive \r\n3D maps permit an immediate understanding of the global structure unavailable \r\nfrom the data in its original form as lines of text with only hostnames and IP \r\naddresses. Data visualization techniques such as grouping and thresholding allow \r\nfurther analysis of specific aspects of the MBone topology. We distribute the \r\ninteractive 3D maps through the World-Wide Web using the VRML file format, thus \r\nallowing network maintainers throughout the world to analyze the structure more \r\neffectively than would be possible with still pictures or pre-made videos. \r\n"

     "description": "As the Internet begins to enter the popular scope, portending large\r\nscale changes in how society will operate, important questions have\r\nemerged regarding issues of fairness and responsibility with respect to\r\nseveral aspects of the base Internet architecture.\r\n\r\nThe questions are many, and all have cumbersome legal, financial, and\r\ncultural ramifications. We focus here on only one: the addressing\r\nmodel. Addresses are the technical cornerstone of the Internet's\r\nability to move data from sender to any connected receiver. The shape\r\nof the address space ultimately determines the effective scalability\r\nand constrains the financial model of the network. We contrast two\r\nmodels of address assignment, provider and geographic based, expanding\r\non Tsuchiya's analysis, and explore their ramifications.\r\n\r\nOne difficulty in discussing address space is that although its\r\neffective use is essential for the technical feasibility of Internet\r\noperation, the ownership of address space and the responsibility for\r\njustifying its use remain ill-defined. There are several revealing\r\nanalogies in other spheres, e.g., spectrum assignment and international\r\ntelephony. Like spectrum bands, IP address space is a finite and\r\ncontended resource that requires careful assignment and management. We\r\nnote also that it has been, and continues to be, particularly\r\nchallenging for regulatory bodies to create and enforce equitable and\r\nconsistent policies for spectrum allocation.\r\n\r\nInternet addressing policy must be constructed out of a careful balance among: \r\n\r\n* service requirements of end users\r\n* base technology of the network\r\n* cost effectiveness of service provision\r\n* ability of providers to regain infrastructure costs\r\n* use of the Internet as a fundamental technology of society as a the phone system\r\n\r\nAlthough the IETF has entertained discussion of addressing policy\r\nincluding all of the above issues, the Internet has reached a stage of\r\nmaturity and breadth of scope that requires wider debate of these\r\nissues."

     "description": "Domain names serve two distinct purposes. They are used as a \"handle\" for users to specify a particular computer. A domain name server supports database queries to map these handles to the corresponding IP address with which one needs to communicate, and insert that address into the packets that comprise the data stream sent to that computer. The second use is one that was not originally envisioned: domain names have fallen into the role of a rudimentary directory system. Rather than looking up the name of a specific computer in a directory, the way one uses a phone book, users tend to assume that the domain name itself is strongly related to a company name or service offering. The problem with this assumption is that company and service names are far from unique, even in a local context and far less so on the global Internet.\r\n\r\nWe feel that the reliance on the DNS for a directory service only indicates our desperate need for a real directory service; it does not prove that the DNS should be that service.\r\n"

They must provide\na robust environment in which differences between the attached client\nnetworks, such as in technologies used by different networks or in\nadministrative and operational policies and procedures, do not become\nbarriers to interconnection. Additionally, they must have policies that\ndo not hinder competition between classes of attached networks (such as\nthe often conflicting business interests of large, nationwide networks\nversus smaller, regional networks). Two policies which have had a\ntremendous effect on the configuration of today's Internet are\ncommercialization, the use of the Internet for commercial as well as\nresearch and educational purposes, and privatization, the\nimplementation and operation of the Internet networks by the private\nsector rather than the government sector. The interaction between the\npolicies of commercialization and privatization and the evolution of\nInternet exchanges is examined here in detail.\n\n"

It now faces a crossroads.\r\nCitizens, corporations and governments are waking to the opportunities\r\npresented by a truly connected global economy, and reexamining\r\nfundamental principles of intellectual property law and communications\r\nin light of the realities of cyberspace. Organizational behavior and\r\nboundaries, business practices and financial systems are also adapting\r\nto the new medium. Society is at the forefront of the information\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nThe number of North American Internet service providers pioneering this\r\nrevolution now stands at over 3,000, approximately a dozen of which\r\nqualify as national backbone providers. Internationally, the number of\r\nInternet hosts has almost doubled over the year ending July 1996,\r\nreaching 12,881,000. Domains quadrupled over this period to 488,000.1/\r\nCompetition is fierce among the builders and operators of this nascent\r\ninfrastructure, driven by demands for additional capacity and new\r\ncustomers. However, neither the industry nor the research community\r\nthat developed and nurtured the early Internet are spending significant\r\nattention on assessing current robustness or future capacity needs.\r\n\r\nThis paper has three goals. We first provide background on the current\r\nInternet architecture and describe why measurements are a key element\r\nin the development of a robust and financially successful commercial\r\nInternet. We then discuss the current state of Internet metrics\r\nanalysis and steps underway within the Internet Engineering Task Force\r\n(IETF) as well as other arenas to encourage the development and\r\ndeployment of Internet performance monitoring and workload\r\ncharacterization tools. Finally, we offer a model for a cooperative\r\nassociation for Internet data analysis among Internet competitors.\r\n\r\n"

Since a typical Web transaction involves a handful of service providers, any congested link along the way can cause the entire connection to be slow. It might be your local provider, a backbone operator, or the remote server's provider. Or it may be that the remote server machine is just too busy. When Web sites suddenly become popular, the server systems are often unprepared to handle the load. It is also somewhat appropriate to blame the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) because the current version transfers only one request per connection.\n\nWhat can be done to speed things up?\n"

In particular, using encryption, such as that\r\noffered by Kerberos for interactive rlogin sessions, can have a\r\nsignificant adverse impact in situations where lower network layers\r\n(e.g., modems) try to perform compression to optimize transmission\r\nperformance. Such interaction between network layers poses an acute\r\nproblem for low-speed (e.g., dial-up) lines.  Although it is no\r\nsurprise that encryption precludes the ability to perform subsequent\r\ncompression, it is worth examining its implication for the recent\r\npopularity of adding network security mechanisms to extant\r\napplications. The example we show is symbolic of a more general issue\r\nin distributed system engineering: if both security and performance are\r\ndesign goals, security cannot be an afterthought without expecting a\r\nsignificant loss in performance. We must thus design security as well\r\nas performance _into_ the architecture, rather than on top of it.\r\n\r\n"

,
     "datePublished": "1994.11",
     "description": "The current architecture and implementation of the Internet assumes a vast aggregation of traffic from many sources and stochastic distribution of traffic both in space (traffic source) and time (burstiness of traffic volume). Given this general assumption, Internet components typically have little if any ability to control the volume and distribution of incoming traffic. As a result the network, particularly from the perspective of the router, is vulnerable to significant consumption of networking resources by high-volume applications, with possibly little stochastic behavior, from a few users. This often impacts the overall profile of network traffic as aggregated from many clients. An example is the continuous flows introduced by real time applications such as packet audio, video, or rapidly changing graphics.\r\n\r\nThis situation creates a time window where applications exist on a network not designed for them, but before an appropriately architected network can augment the current infrastructure and cope with the new type of workload.  We propose a scheme for voluntarily setting Internet traffic priorities by end-users and applications, using the existing 3-bit Precedence field in the Internet Protocol header.\r\n\r\nOur proposal has three elements.  First, network routers would queue incoming packets by IP Precedence value instead of the customary single-threaded FIFO. Second, users and their applications would voluntarily use different and appropriate precedence values in their outgoing transmissions according to some defined criteria.  Third, network service providers may monitor the precedence levels of traffic entering their network, and use some mechanism such as a quota system to discourage users from setting high precedence values on all their traffic.  All three elements can be implemented gradually and selectively across the Internet infrastructure, providing a smooth transition path from the present system.  The experience we gain from an implementation will furthermore provide a valuable knowledge base from which to develop sound accounting and billing mechanisms and policies in the future.\r\n"

     "description": "Traffic statistics normally collected during day-to-day operation of wide-area datagram networks are frequently insufficient for researchers to use in studying the workloads and performance of these realistic environments.  As wide-area networks become more ubiquitous and service expectations rise, current methods for collecting data will become even less suitable.  We examine ways to improve techniques for statistics collection so that the resulting data will enable researchers, and indeed service providers themselves, to develop more accurate Internet traffic models.\r\n\r\nWe first provide a taxonomy of traffic characterization tasks. We then use operationally collected statistics to characterize traffic of the T1 and T3 NSFNET backbones.  Because current infrastructural statistics collection is oriented toward either short term operational requirements or periodic simplistic traffic reports to funding agencies, this data \r\nis often not conducive to assessing network workload or performance; we evaluate to what extent they are useful for tasks in the taxonomy, and propose improvements in current statistics collection architectures, with particular application to the NSFNET backbone.  We include an investigation of the effects of sampling to characterize traffic and evaluate performance in a high-speed wide-area network environment.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of the thesis we focus on items in the outlined taxonomy that are not conducive to investigation using operationally collected statistics.  These items mostly involve short-term aspects of Internet flows, which operationally collected statistics fail to expose.  We develop a general methodology for use in assessing Internet flow profiles and their impact on an aggregate Internet workload.  Our methodology for profiling flows differs from many previous studies that have concentrated on end-point definitions of flows defined by TCP connections using the TCP SYN and FIN control mechanism.  We focus on the IP layer and define flows based on traffic satisfying various temporal and spatial locality conditions, as observed at internal points of the network.  We first define the parameter space and then concentrate on metrics characterizing both individual flows and the aggregate flow.  Metrics of individual flows include: volume in \r\npackets and bytes per flow, and flow duration.  Metrics of the aggregate flow, or workload characteristics from the network perspective, include:  counts of the number of active, new, and timed out flows per time interval; flow \r\ninterarrival and arrival processes; and flow locality metrics.  Applying the methodology to our measurements yields significant observations of the Internet infrastructure, which have implications for performance requirements \r\nof routers at Internet hotspots, general and specialized flow-based routing algorithms, future usage-based accounting requirements, and traffic prioritization.\r\n\r\nFinally, we discuss trends that will affect how Internet service providers collect statistics in the future.  Improvements in operational statistics collection, such as support for flow assessment, will help networking activities along various time horizons, from defining service quality patterns to long-term capacity planning.  We offer a unique combination of operational and research perspectives, allowing us to reduce the gaps among (1) what network service providers need; (2) what statistics service providers can provide; and (3) what network analysis requires."

     "description": "This paper presents a study of single direction latencies to\r\nselected destinations of the Internet utilizing a variety of paths. The\r\nobjective is to demonstrate that round-trip latencies are an\r\ninsufficient and sometimes misleading method to determine unidirectional\r\ndelays. This claim has significant implications for high-speed,\r\nmulti-application, wide-area, traffic aggregating networking\r\nenvironments which often require predictability of precise delay.\r\n\r\nAssuming that a round trip path is symetric and dividing a RTT\r\nin half to find the latency in either the outgoing or incoming\r\ntranmission path is highly inaccurate as there are both static and\r\ndu\\ynamic reasons for the paths traversed by packets between hosts to be\r\nasymetric. The static reason is that the route may be permanently\r\nconfigured to be asymetric because of network harware limitations (for\r\nexample simplex links). The dynamic reasons for asymetrically datagram\r\npaths are resource contentions between other components in the network.\r\nDigitial continuous media networked applications require good\r\npredicatability of unidirectional network delays, which simply halving\r\nthe RTT cannot give."

This paper presents a study of the\r\nperformance of various methods of sampling in answering questions\r\nrelated to wide area network traffic characterization. Using a packet\r\ntrace from a network environment that aggregates traffic from a large\r\nnumber of sources, we simulate various sampling approaches, including\r\ntime-driven and event-driven methods, with both random and deterministic\r\nselection patterns, at a variety of granularities. Using several metrics\r\nwhich indicate the similarity between two distributions, we then compare\r\nthe sampled traces to the parent population. Our results revealed that\r\nthe time-triggered techniques did not perform as well as the\r\npacket-triggered ones. Furthermore, the performance differences within\r\neach class (packet-based or time-based techniques) are small.\r\n"

The Interagency Interim NREN is intended as a near term research and development program to extend the capabilities and breadth of connectivity of today's research and education (R\u0026amp;E) networks. This network will provide not only the opportunity for agency backbones and mid-level networks to connect to NSF-funded networks, but also act as a limited testbed for new technologies in the migration to a gigabit NREN. In order to ensure a smooth transition to a national gigabit network infrastructure which can support the combined requirements of federal agencies, the U.S. research and educational institutions, and industrial collaborations with U.S. R\\\u0026amp;E institutions, the National Science Foundation has collaborated with other federal agencies in establishing this framework for the Interagency Interim NREN.\r\n\r\n"

     "description": "The current TCP/IP Internet may be modeled as an arbitrary\ninterconnection of autonomous systems (AS). An AS is defined to be a\ncollection of internetwork routers managed and administered by a single\nauthority or organization. Typically an AS uses a single routing\nprotocol within its boundaries to generate and propagate routing\ninformation. In this paper we analyse the performance of a technique\nthat injects only partial reachability information derived from the\ninter-AS routing into the intra-AS routing.\n\nThis performance evaluation is based on traffic data obtained from the\nNSFNET backbone. We show, for instance, that injecting just 10% of the\ntotal inter-AS reachability information into the intra-AS routing\npermits the forwarding of at least 85% of the transit traffic without\nresorting to fallback _fault_ mechanisms."
