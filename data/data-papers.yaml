ABS: Modeling of network traffic provides a foundation for designing and configuring
  network infrastructures, and has been an active area of research. Several types
  of internet traffic, against popular belief, manifest self-similar behaviors. However,
  recent years have seen a rapid growth of the Internet, both in terms of scale and
  the variety of services. In this paper, we focus on whether the self-similarity
  model still fits the traffic, and if so, we estimate the second-order self-similarity
  with current estimation methods.

TOPKEY: passive_2016
ABS: The broader use of Software Defined Network (SDN) controllers creates periodic
  changes in topology and traffic rates at routers that adapt the network to changes
  in network conditions. Thus the transient behaviour of network components, and in
  particular routers, is becoming of great interest. Since standard queueing models
  are difficult to analyze under time-varying conditions, we propose a tractable diffusion
  approximation for both the transient and steady-state behaviour of a network router.
  In particular, the analysis provides the steady-state and transient delay and packet
  loss probability as a function of traffic load and other characteristics. Using
  these results, we show that when SDN routers change the paths of flows frequently,
  the networks behaviour may often be far from its steady-state behaviour. Therefore
  any network optimization conducted with the help of SDN should not be based on steady-state
  behaviour, but rather on some metrics related to the time-dependent network behaviour.

TOPKEY: passive_2016
ABS: We present a model of a Software Defined Network (SDN) where frequent changes
  in routing and traffic rates at routers are needed to respond to the security, quality
  of service (QoS), and energy savings requirements of applications such as the Internet
  of Things. Such frequent path and traffic changes introduce time-dependent network
  behaviours, and standard queueing models are not well adapted to analyse the transient
  regime, we propose a tractable diffusion approximation for both the transient and
  steady-state behaviour. Our model can represent any network topology transmitting
  time-dependent flows with routing changes, and computes queue length and delay distributions
  at each network node and along complete paths between senders and receivers. Using
  realistic router parameters, we show that transients occupy a significant fraction
  of system time, so that the optimisation conducted with SDN controllers needs to
  include the effect of time-dependent behaviours.

ABS: Some IP blocks occasionally change their physical location, such as when blocks
  are transferred to different organizations, or repurposed within an organization.
  IP geolocation systems need to identify such changes to provide accurate results
  for location-dependent applications such as geo-blocking and online fraud prevention.
  We propose an efficient method to identify IP blocks that move, since full geolocation
  is expensive and unnecessary for blocks that do not move. Our approach uses persistent
  changes in latency as an indicator of block movement, tracking all ping-responsive
  IPv4 /24 blocks from a handful of globally distributed vantage points. We estimate
  around 2.1% of the 3.77M /24 blocks we studied have changed location at least once
  in the last 3 months of 2018. We find that the remaining blocks were consistently
  RTT-stable during the same period, suggesting that their locations were also stable.
  We validate a random sample of blocks we identify as moving and confirm 80% (41
  of 51) through traceroutes.

ABS: Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) are Internet hubs that mainly provide the switching
  infrastructure to interconnect networks and exchange traffic. While the initial
  goal of IXPs was to bring together networks residing in the same city or country,
  and thus keep local traffic local, this model is gradually shifting. Many networks
  connect to IXPs without having physical presence at their switching infrastructure.
  This practice, called Remote Peering, is changing the Internet topology and economy,
  and has become the subject of a contentious debate within the network operators
  community. However, despite the increasing attention it attracts, the understanding
  of the characteristics and impact of remote peering is limited. In this work, we
  introduce and validate a heuristic methodology for discovering remote peers at IXPs.
  We (i) identify critical remote peering inference challenges, (ii) infer remote
  peers with high accuracy (>97%) and coverage (94%) per IXP, and (iii) characterize
  different aspects of the remote peering ecosystem by applying our methodology to
  30 large IXPs. We observe that remote peering is a significantly common practice
  in all the studied IXPs; for the largest IXPs, remote peers account for 40% of their
  member base. We also show that today, IXP growth is mainly driven by remote peering,
  which contributes two times more than local peering.

TOPKEY: topology-as-rank, topology-as-relationships
ABS: Over the past two decades, the research community has developed many approaches
  to study the Internet topology. In particular, starting from 2007, various tools
  explored the inference of subnets, i.e., sets of devices located on the same connection
  medium which can communicate directly with each other at the link layer. In this
  paper, we first discuss how todays traffic engineering policies increase the difficulty
  of subnet inference. We carefully characterize typical difficulties and quantify
  them in the wild. Next, we introduce WISE (Wide and lInear Subnet inferencE), a
  new tool which tackles those difficulties and discovers, in a linear time, large
  networks subnets. Based on two ground truth networks, we demonstrate that WISE outperforms
  state-of-the-art tools. Then, through large-scale measurements, we show that the
  selection of a vantage point with WISE has a marginal effect regarding accuracy.
  Finally, we discuss how subnets can be used to infer neighborhoods (i.e., aggregates
  of subnets located at most one hop from each other). We discuss how these neighborhoods
  can lead to bipartite models of the Internet and present validation results and
  an evaluation of neighborhoods in the wild, using WISE. Both our code and data are
  freely available.

ABS: Volumetric Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are a significant concern
  for information technology-based organizations. These attacks result in significant
  revenue losses in terms of wastage of resources and unavailability of services at
  the victim (e.g., business websites, DNS servers, etc.) as well as the Internet
  Service Providers (ISPs) along the path of the attack. The state-of-the-art DDoS
  mitigation mechanisms attempt to alleviate the losses at either the victim or the
  ISPs, but not both. In this paper, we present Net-Police, which is a traffic patrolling
  system for DDoS mitigation. Net-Police identifies the sources of attack so that
  filters can be employed at these sources in order to quickly mitigate the attack.
  Such a solution effectively prevents the flow of malicious traffic across the ISP
  networks, thereby benefiting the ISPs also. Net-Police patrols the network by designating
  a small number of routers as dynamic packet taggers, to prune benign regions in
  the network, and localize the search to the Autonomous Systems (AS) from which the
  attack originates. We evaluate the proposed solution on 257 real-world topologies
  from the Internet Topology Zoo library and the Internet AS level topology. The paper
  also presents details of our hardware test-bed platform consisting of 30 routers
  on which network services such as Net-Police can be implemented and studied for
  on-field feasibility. Our experiments reveal that Net-Police performs better than
  the state-of-the-art cloud-based and traceback-based solutions in terms of ISP bandwidth
  savings and availability of the victim to legitimate clients.

  problem of adding a small number of edges in the uncertain network for maximizing
  the reliability between a given pair of nodes. We study the NP -hardness and the
  approximation hardness of our problem, and design effective, scalable solutions.
  Furthermore, we consider extended versions of our problem (e.g., multiple source
  and target nodes can be provided as input) to support and demonstrate a wider family
  of queries and applications, including sensor network reliability maximization and
  social influence maximization. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and
  efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

ABS: In order to reach their destinations, IP packets must go through multiple physical
  devices, across several IP networks. The process of selecting their path is called
  routing and relies on information shared among routers using a routing protocol.
  In the Internet, different protocols are used at different scales. For instance,
  Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is typically used for routing packets between sub-networks
  belonging to the same organization whereas Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the

TOPKEY: telescope-3days-conficker
ABS: Spam emails also known as unsolicited emails (maybe commercial or maybe not)
  i.e. those mails which are sent without our request or concern. Email spam is the
  practice of sending unwanted emails, mostly contains commercial messages to randomly
  generated persons. In the internet email spam is widespread because of such low
  cost of sending emails other than any other means of communication. It is important
  to filter spam emails because most of the malicious activities performed in the
  internet done through email spamming. Though there are many spam filters are available
  we still get huge amount of spam emails. This is not because the filters are not
  accurate & effective; the reason is the generation of quick and effective counters
  of the algorithm used in the filters. In our project we used mainly three supervised
  learning algorithms namely Linear SVC, Multinomial NB, and k-NN to implement the
  filter. We used these algorithms to train the system about spam email by using the
  feature called word count vector which is generated by processing a dataset filled
  with existing emails containing both spam and legitimate emails. The full process
  of the project and the result of the execution by implementing the three models/algorithms
  are discussed.

TOPKEY: topology-as-rank, topology-as-relationships
PUBLISH: University of Twente
ABS: An Autonomous System (AS) is a group of host IP addresses, known as routing prefixes,
  that share common routing policies. Multiple ASes interact with each other through
  a massive network of links which reflect customer-provider and peer-to-peer partnerships
  among network operators. Such partnerships form an Autonomous System Network (ASN)
  that connects millions of hosts around the world and gives shape to the topology
  of the Internet. The ranking of ASes in an ASN allows researchers to acquire important
  insights into the complex structure of the Internet. ASes are ranked by the Center
  for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) by their customer cone size, which is
  the number of direct and indirect customers. While the customer cone size and other
  similar metrics represent an intuitive way to measure the rank of ASes, they suffer
  from low monotonicity, making it difficult to discriminate among ASes with the same
  measurements. In this research we propose a new approach for ranking ASes within
  the ASN, measuring customer cones by exploiting a gravitational approach used in
  Network Theory to quantify the influence of nodes in a complex graph and their capacity
  to become good spreaders. We will also propose an efficient algorithm to measure
  gravitational metrics by exploiting the fact that customer cones form large Directed
  Acyclic Graphs, in order to handle large ASNs with dozens of thousands of nodes
  and links.

TOPKEY: topology-as-relationships
ABS: Distributed reflective denial of service (DRDoS) attacks are a popular choice
  among adversaries. In fact, one of the largest DDoS attacks ever recorded, reaching
  a peak of 1.3Tbps against GitHub, was a memcached-based DRDoS attack. More recently,
  a record-breaking 2.3Tbps attack against Amazon AWS was due to a CLDAP-based DRDoS
  attack. Although reflective attacks have been known for years, DRDoS attacks are
  unfortunately still popular and largely unmitigated. In this paper, we study in-the-wild
  DRDoS attacks observed from a large Internet exchange point (IXP) and provide a
  number of security-relevant measurements and insights. To enable this study, we
  first developed IXmon, an open-source DRDoS detection system specifically designed
  for deployment at large IXP-like network connectivity providers and peering hubs.
  We deployed IXmon at Southern Crossroads (SoX), an IXP-like hub that provides both
  peering and upstream Internet connectivity services to more than 20 research and
  education (R&E) networks in the South-East United States. In a period of about 21
  months, IXmon detected more than 900 DRDoS attacks towards 31 different victim ASes.
  An analysis of the real-world DRDoS attacks detected by our system shows that most
  DRDoS attacks are short lived, lasting only a few minutes, but that large-volume,
  long-lasting, and highly-distributed attacks against R&E networks are not uncommon.
  We then use the results of our analysis to discuss possible attack mitigation approaches
  that can be deployed at the IXP level, before the attack traffic overwhelms the
  victims network bandwidth.

ABS: Restricting data plane processing to packet headers precludes analysis of payloads
  to improve routing and security decisions. DeepMatch delivers line-rate regular
  expression matching on payloads using Network Processors (NPs). It further supports
  packet reordering to match patterns in flows that cross packet boundaries. Our evaluation
  shows that an implementation of DeepMatch, on a 40 Gbps Netronome NFP-6000 SmartNIC,
  achieves up to line rate for streams of unrelated packets and up to 20 Gbps when
  searches span multiple packets within a flow. In contrast with prior work, this
  throughput is data-independent and adds no burstiness. DeepMatch opens new opportunities
  for programmable data planes.

TOPKEY: passive-2015, passive-2019
ABS: Bloom filters are widely used in networking to accelerate checks and in particular
  to avoid accessing slow memories when a match will not be found. Unfortunately,
  filtering requires several on-chip memory bits per element and thus when the tables
  are large and the on-chip memory small is not applicable. In those cases, caching
  the most frequently accessed elements on-chip seems the only viable option. However,
  the key is typically formed by several packet header fields, which means that each
  cache entry consumes a significant amount of on-chip memory bits. In this paper,
  an efficient scheme to cache negatives, that is elements that will not find a match
  on the table is presented. In more detail, the proposed scheme enables the caching
  of negatives using less than 16 bits per entry regardless of the size of the key.
  This translates to a reduction of at least 6x in the size of the cache when used
  for example flow tracking.

ABS: Sketches have successfully provided accurate and fine-grained measurements (e.g.,
  flow size and heavy hitters) which are imperative for network management. In particular,
  Count-Min (CM) sketch is widely utilized in many applications due to its simple
  design and ease of implementation. There have been many efforts to build monitoring
  frameworks based on Count-Min sketch. However, these frameworks either support very
  specific measurement tasks or they cannot be implemented on high-speed programmable
  hardware (PISA). In this work, we propose FCM, a framework that is designed to support
  generic network measurement with high accuracy. Our key contribution is FCM-Sketch,
  a data structure that has a lightweight implementation on the emerging PISA programmable
  switches. FCM-Sketch can also be used as a substitute for CM-Sketch in applications
  that use CM-Sketch. We have implemented FCM-Sketch on a commodity programmable switch
  (Barefoot Tofino) using the P4 language. Our evaluation shows that FCM-Sketch can
  reduce the errors in many measurement tasks by 50% to 80% compared to CM-Sketch
  and other state-of-the-art approaches.

ABS: 'BGP communities are widely used to tag prefix aggregates for policy, traffic
  engineering, and inter-AS signaling. Because individual ASes define their own community
  semantics, many ASes blindly propagate communities they do not recognize. Prior
  research has shown the potential security vulnerabilities when communities are not
  filtered. This work sheds light on a second unintended side-effect of communities
  and permissive propagation: an increase in unnecessary BGP routing messages. Due
  to its transitive property, a change in the community attribute induces update messages
  throughout established routes, just updating communities. We ground our work by
  characterizing the handling of updates with communities, including when filtered,
  on multiple real-world BGP implementations in controlled laboratory experiments.
  We then examine 10 years of BGP messages observed in the wild at two route collector
  systems. In 2020, approximately 25% of all announcements modify the community attribute,
  but retain the AS path of the most recent announcement; an additional 25% update
  neither community nor AS path. Using predictable beacon prefixes, we demonstrate
  that communities lead to an increase in update messages both at the tagging AS and
  at neighboring ASes that neither add nor filter communities. This effect is prominent
  for geolocation communities during path exploration: on a single day, 63% of all
  unique community attributes are revealed exclusively due to global withdrawals.'

ABS: Network measurement is an essential building block for a variety of network applications
  such as traffic engineering, quality of service, load-balancing and intrusion detection.
  Maintaining a per-flow state is often impractical due to the large number of flows,
  and thus modern systems use complex data structures that are updated with each incoming
  packet. Therefore, designing measurement applications that operate at line speed
  is a significant challenge in this domain. In this work, we address this challenge
  by providing a unified mechanism that improves the update time of a variety of network
  algorithms. We do so by identifying, studying, and optimizing a common algorithmic
  pattern that we call q-MAX. The goal is to maintain the largest q values in a stream
  of packets. We formally analyze the problem and introduce interval and sliding window
  algorithms that have a worst-case constant update time. We show that our algorithms
  perform up to X20 faster than library algorithms, and using these new algorithms
  for several popular measurement applications yields a throughput improvement of
  up to X12 on real network traces. Finally, we implemented the scheme within Open
  vSwitch, a state of the art virtual switch. We show that q-MAX based monitoring
  runs in line speed while current monitoring techniques are significantly slower.

  These offer alternatives to traditional social networks like Twitter, YouTube, and
  Facebook, by enabling the operation of web infrastructure and services without centralised
  ownership or control. Although their services differ greatly, modern DW platforms
  mostly rely on two key innovations: first, their open source software allows anybody
  to setup independent servers (instances) that people can sign-up to and use within
  a local community; and second, they build on top of federation protocols so that
  instances can mesh together, in a peer-to-peer fashion, to offer a globally integrated
  platform. In this paper, we present a measurement-driven exploration of these two
  innovations, using a popular DW microblogging platform (Mastodon) as a case study.
  We focus on identifying key challenges that might disrupt continuing efforts to
  decentralise the web, and empirically highlight a number of properties that are

ABS: The growing demand for an ever-increasing number of cloud services is profoundly
  transforming the Internets interconnection or peering ecosystem, and one example
  is the emergence of virtual private interconnections (VPIs). However, due to the
  underlying technologies, these VPIs are not publicly visible and traffic traversing
  them remains largely hidden as it bypasses the public Internet. In particular, existing
  techniques for inferring Internet interconnections are unable to detect these VPIs
  and are also incapable of mapping them to the physical facility or geographic region
  where they are established. In this paper, we present a third-party measurement
  study aimed at revealing all the peerings between Amazon and the rest of the Internet.
  We describe our technique for inferring these peering links and pay special attention
  to inferring the VPIs associated with this largest cloud provider. We also present
  and evaluate a new method for pinning (i.e., geo-locating) each end of the inferred
  interconnections or peering links. Our study provides a first look at Amazons peering
  fabric. In particular, by grouping Amazons peerings based on their key features,
  we illustrate the specific role that each group plays in how Amazon peers with other

  have relied on unsolicited traffic captured in darknets, focusing on random scans
  of the address space. In this work, we track scanning activity through the lens
  of unsolicited traffic captured at the firewalls of some 89,000 hosts of a major
  Content Distribution Network (CDN). Our vantage point has two distinguishing features
  compared to darknets: (i) it is distributed across some 1,300 networks, and (ii)
  its servers are live, offering services and thus emitting traffic. While all servers
  receive a baseline level of probing from Internet-wide scans, i.e., scans targeting
  random subsets of or the entire IPv4 space, we show that some 30% of all logged
  scan traffic is the result of localized scans. We find that localized scanning campaigns
  often target narrow regions in the address space, and that their characteristics
  in terms of target selection strategy and scanned services differ vastly from the
  more widely known Internet-wide scans. Our observations imply that conventional
  darknets can only partially illuminate scanning activity, and may severely underestimate
  widespread attempts to scan and exploit individual services in specific prefixes

ABS: Knowledge of the Internet topology and the business relationships between Autonomous
  Systems (ASes) is the basis for studying many aspects of the Internet. Despite the
  significant progress achieved by latest inference algorithms, their inference results
  still suffer from errors on some critical links due to limited data, thus hindering
  many applications that rely on the inferred relationships. We take an in-depth analysis
  on the challenges inherent in the data, especially the limited coverage and biased
  concentration of the vantage points (VPs). Some aspects of them have been largely
  overlooked but will become more exacerbated when the Internet further grows. Then
  we develop TopoScope, a framework for accurately recovering AS relationships from
  such fragmentary observations. TopoScope uses ensemble learning and Bayesian Network
  to mitigate the observation bias originating not only from a single VP, but also
  from the uneven distribution of available VPs. It also discovers the intrinsic similarities
  between groups of adjacent links, and infers the relationships on hidden links that
  are not directly observable. Compared to state-of-the-art inference algorithms,
  TopoScope reduces the inference error by up to 2.7-4 times, discovers the relationships
  for around 30,000 upper layer hidden AS links, and is still more accurate and stable
  under more incomplete or biased observations.

ABS: Limited data access is a longstanding barrier to data-driven research and development
  in the networked systems community. In this work, we explore if and how generative
  adversarial networks (GANs) can be used to incentivize data sharing by enabling
  a generic framework for sharing synthetic datasets with minimal expert knowledge.
  As a specific target, our focus in this paper is on time series datasets with metadata
  (e.g., packet loss rate measurements with corresponding ISPs). We identify key challenges
  of existing GAN approaches for such workloads with respect to fidelity (e.g., long-term
  dependencies, complex multidimensional relationships, mode collapse) and privacy
  (i.e., existing guarantees are poorly understood and can sacrifice fidelity). To
  improve fidelity, we design a custom workflow called DoppelGANger (DG) and demonstrate
  that across diverse real-world datasets (e.g., bandwidth measurements, cluster requests,
  web sessions) and use cases (e.g., structural characterization, predictive modeling,
  algorithm comparison), DG achieves up to 43% better fidelity than baseline models.
  Although we do not resolve the privacy problem in this work, we identify fundamental
  challenges with both classical notions of privacy and recent advances to improve
  the privacy properties of GANs, and suggest a potential roadmap for addressing these
  challenges. By shedding light on the promise and challenges, we hope our work can
  rekindle the conversation on workflows for data sharing.

  a large set of known DNS servers worldwide, using various spoofed-source addresses.
  We classify roughly half of the 62,000 networks (autonomous systems) we tested as
  vulnerable to infiltration due to lack of DSAV. As an illustration of the dangers
  these networks expose themselves to, we demonstrate the ability to fingerprint the

ABS: Many systems rely on traceroutes to monitor or characterize the Internet. The
  quality of the systems inferences depends on the completeness and freshness of the
  traceroutes, but the refreshing of traceroutes is constrained by limited resources
  at vantage points. Previous approaches predict which traceroutes are likely out-of-date
  in order to allocate measurements, or monitor BGP feeds for changes that overlap
  traceroutes. Both approaches miss many path changes for reasons including the difficulty
  in predicting changes and the coarse granularity of BGP paths. This paper presents
  techniques to identify out-of-date traceroutes without issuing any measurements,
  even if a change is not visible at BGP granularity. We base our techniques on two
  observations. First, although BGP updates encode routes at AS granularity, routers
  issue updates when they change intra-domain routes or peering points within the
  same AS path. Second, route changes correlate across paths, and many publicly available
  traceroutes exist. Our techniques maintain an atlas of traceroutes by monitoring
  BGP updates and publicly available traceroutes for signals to mark overlapping atlas
  traceroutes as stale. We focus our analysis of traceroute path changes at the granularity
  of border router IPs which provides an abstraction finer than AS- or PoP-level but
  is not affected by the periodicity of intra-domain load balancers. Our evaluation
  indicates that 80% of the traceroutes that our techniques signal as stale have indeed
  changed, even though the AS hops remained the same. Our techniques combine to identify
  79% of all border IP changes, without issuing a single online measurement.

TOPKEY: topology-as-relationships
ABS: Classically, the design of multi-agent systems is approached using techniques
  from distributed optimization such as dual descent and consensus algorithms. Such
  algorithms depend on convergence to global consensus before any individual agent
  can determine its local action. This leads to challenges with respect to communication
  overhead and robustness, and improving algorithms with respect to these measures
  has been a focus of the community for decades. This paper presents a new approach
  for multi-agent system design based on ideas from the emerging field of local computation
  algorithms. The framework we develop, LOcal Convex Optimization (LOCO), is the first
  local computation algorithm for convex optimization problems and can be applied
  in a wide-variety of settings. We demonstrate the generality of the framework via
  applications to Network Utility Maximization (NUM) and the distributed training
  of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), providing numerical results illustrating the
  improvement compared to classical distributed optimization approaches in each case.

ABS: Traffic measurement provides critical information for network management, resource
  allocation, traffic engineering, and attack detection. Most prior art has been geared
  towards specific application needs with specific performance objectives. To support
  diverse requirements with efficient and future-proof implementation, this paper
  takes a new approach to establish common frameworks, each for a family of traffic
  measurement solutions that share the same implementation structure, providing a
  high level of generality, for both size and spread measurements and for all flows.
  The designs support many options of performance-overhead tradeoff with as few as
  one memory update per packet and as little space as several bits per flow on average.
  Such a family-based approach will unify implementation by removing redundancy from
  different measurement tasks and support reconfigurability in a plug-n-play manner.
  We demonstrate the connection and difference in the design of these traffic measurement
  families and perform experimental comparisons on hardware/software platforms to
  find their tradeoff, which provide practical guidance for which solutions to use
  under given performance goals.

ABS: Modern network telemetry systems collect and analyze massive amounts of raw data
  in a space efficient manner. These require advanced capabilities such as drill down
  queries that allow iterative refinement of the search space. We present a first
  integral solution that (i) enables multiple measurement tasks inside the same data
  structure, (ii) supports specifying the time frame of interest as part of its queries,
  and (iii) is sketch-based and thus space efficient. Namely, our approach allows
  the user to define both the measurement task (e.g., heavy hitters, entropy estimation,
  count distinct, etc.) and the time frame of relevance (e.g., 5PM-6PM) at query time.
  Our approach provides accuracy guarantees and is the only space-efficient solution
  that offers such capabilities. Finally, we demonstrate how our system can be used
  for accurately pinpointing the start of a realistic DDoS attack.

ABS: "Load balancers choose among load-balanced paths to distribute traffic as if
  it makes no difference using one path or another. This work shows that the latency
  difference between load-balanced paths (called latency imbalance ), previously deemed
  insignificant, is now prevalent from the perspective of the cloud and affects various
  latency-sensitive applications. In this work, we present the first large-scale measurement
  study of latency imbalance from a cloud-centric view. Using public cloud around
  the globe, we measure latency imbalance both between data centers (DCs) in the cloud
  and from the cloud to the public Internet. Our key findings include that 1) Amazons
  and Alibabas clouds together have latency difference between load-balanced paths
  larger than 20ms to 21% of public IPv4 addresses; 2) Googles secret in having lower
  latency imbalance than other clouds is to use its own well-balanced private WANs
  to transit traffic close to the destinations and that 3) latency imbalance is also
  prevalent between DCs in the cloud, where 8 pairs of DCs are found to have load-balanced
  paths with latency difference larger than 40ms. We further evaluate the impact of
  latency imbalance on three applications (i.e., NTP, delay-based geolocation and
  VoIP) and propose potential solutions to improve application performance. Our experiments
  show that all three applications can benefit from considering latency imbalance,
  where the accuracy of delay-based geolocation can be greatly improved by simply
  changing how \textttping measures the minimum path latency."

TOPKEY: topology-as-classification, topology-ark-ipv6-routed48, topology-ark-activity
ABS: We consider the problem of discovering the IPv6 network periphery, i.e., the
  last hop router connecting endhosts in the IPv6 Internet. Finding the IPv6 periphery
  using active probing is challenging due to the IPv6 address space size, wide variety
  of provider addressing and subnetting schemes, and incomplete topology traces. As
  such, existing topology mapping systems can miss the large footprint of the IPv6
  periphery, disadvantaging applications ranging from IPv6 census studies to geolocation
  and network resilience. We introduce edgy, an approach to explicitly discover the
  IPv6 network periphery, and use it to find >~64M IPv6 periphery router addresses
  and >~87M links to these last hops -- several orders of magnitude more than in currently
  available IPv6 topologies. Further, only 0.2% of edgys discovered addresses are
  known to existing IPv6 hitlists.

ABS: By moving monolithic network appliances to software running on commodity hardware,
  network function virtualization allows flexible resource sharing among network functions
  and achieves scalability with low cost. However, due to resource contention, network
  functions can suffer from performance problems that are hard to diagnose. In particular,
  when many flows traverse a complex topology of NF instances, it is hard to pinpoint
  root causes for a flow experiencing performance issues such as low throughput or
  high latency. Simply maintaining resource counters at individual NFs is not sufficient
  since the effect of resource contention can propagate across NFs and over time.
  In this paper, we introduce Microscope, a performance diagnosis tool, for network
  functions that leverages queuing information at NFs to identify the root causes
  (i.e., resources, NFs, traffic patterns of flows etc.). Our evaluation on realistic
  NF chains and traffic shows that we can correctly capture root causes behind 89.7%
  of performance impairments, up to 2.5 times more than the state-of-the-art tools
  with low overhead.

ABS: Network telemetry is essential for administrators to monitor massive data traffic
  in a network-wide manner. Existing telemetry solutions often face the dilemma between
  resource efficiency (i.e., low CPU, memory, and bandwidth overhead) and full accuracy
  (i.e., error-free and holistic measurement). We break this dilemma via a network-wide
  architectural design OmniMon, which simultaneously achieves resource efficiency
  and full accuracy in flow-level telemetry for large-scale data centers. OmniMon
  carefully coordinates the collaboration among different types of entities in the
  whole network to execute telemetry operations, such that the resource constraints
  of each entity are satisfied without compromising full accuracy. It further addresses
  consistency in network-wide epoch synchronization and accountability in error-free
  packet loss inference. We prototype OmniMon in DPDK and P4. Testbed experiments
  on commodity servers and Tofino switches demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniMon
  over state-of-the-art telemetry designs.

TOPKEY: passive_2019
ABS: Caches are at the heart of latency-sensitive systems. In this paper, we identify
  a growing challenge for the design of latency-minimizing caches called delayed hits.
  Delayed hits occur at high throughput, when multiple requests to the same object
  queue up before an outstanding cache miss is resolved. This effect increases latencies
  beyond the predictions of traditional caching models and simulations; in fact, caching
  algorithms are designed as if delayed hits simply didnt exist. We show that traditional
  caching strategies -- even so called optimal algorithms -- can fail to minimize
  latency in the presence of delayed hits. We design a new, latency-optimal offline
  caching algorithm called belatedly which reduces average latencies by up to 45%
  compared to the traditional, hit-rate optimal Beladys algorithm. Using belatedly
  as our guide, we show that incorporating an objects aggregate delay into online
  caching heuristics can improve latencies for practical caching systems by up to
  40%. We implement a prototype, Minimum-AggregateDelay (mad), within a CDN caching
  node. Using a CDN production trace and backends deployed in different geographic
  locations, we show that mad can reduce latencies by 12-18% depending on the backend
  RTTs.

ABS: Multi-field packet classification is a crucial component in modern software-defined
  data center networks. To achieve high throughput and low latency, state-of-the-art
  algorithms strive to fit the rule lookup data structures into on-die caches; however,
  they do not scale well with the number of rules. We present a novel approach, NuevoMatch,
  which improves the memory scaling of existing methods. A new data structure, Range
  Query Recursive Model Index (RQ-RMI), is the key component that enables NuevoMatch
  to replace most of the accesses to main memory with model inference computations.
  We describe an efficient training algorithm that guarantees the correctness of the
  RQ-RMI-based classification. The use of RQ-RMI allows the rules to be compressed
  into model weights that fit into the hardware cache. Further, it takes advantage
  of the growing support for fast neural network processing in modern CPUs, such as
  wide vector instructions, achieving a rate of tens of nanoseconds per lookup. Our
  evaluation using 500K multi-field rules from the standard ClassBench benchmark shows
  a geometric mean compression factor of 4.9x, 8x, and 82x, and average performance
  improvement of 2.4x, 2.6x, and 1.6x in throughput compared to CutSplit, NeuroCuts,

ABS: Routing policy configuration plays a crucial role in determining the path that
  network traffic takes to reach a destination. Network administrators/operators typically
  decide the routing policy for their networks/routers independently. The paths/routes
  resulted from these independently configured routing policies might not necessarily
  meet the intent of the network administrators/operators. Even the very basic networkwide
  properties of the routing policies such as reachability between a pair of nodes
  need to be verified.In this paper, we propose a scheme that characterizes routingpolicy
  verification problems into a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) problems. The
  key idea is to formulate the SMT model in a policy-aware manner so as to reduce/eliminate
  the mutual dependencies between variables as much as possible. Further, we reduce
  the size of the generated SMT model through pruning. We implement and evaluate the
  policy-aware model through an outof-box SMT solver. The experimental results show
  that the policyaware model can reduce the time it takes to perform verification
  by as much as 100x even under a modest topology size. It takes only a few minutes
  to answer a query for a topology containing tens of thousands of nodes.

ABS: Short-lived surges in traffic can cause periods of high queue utilization, leading
  to packet loss and delay. To diagnose and alleviate performance problems, networks
  need support for real-time, fine-grained queue measurement. By identifying the flows
  that contribute significantly to queue build-up directly in the data plane, switches
  can make targeted decisions to mark, drop, or reroute these flows in real time.
  However, collecting fine-grained queue statistics is challenging even with modern
  programmable switch hardware, due to limited memory and processing resources in
  the data plane. We present ConQuest, a compact data structure that identifies the
  flows making a significant contribution to the queue. ConQuest operates entirely
  in the data plane, while working within the hardware constraints of programmable
  switches. Additionally, we show how to measure queues in legacy devices through
  link tapping and an off-path switch running ConQuest. Simulations show that ConQuest
  can identify contributing flows with 90% precision on a 1 ms timescale, using less
  than 65 KB of memory. Experiments with our Barefoot Tofino prototype show that ConQuest-enabled
  active queue management reduces flow-completion time.

ABS: Network-wide traffic analytics are often needed for various network monitoring
  tasks. These measurements are often performed by collecting samples at network switches,
  which are then sent to the controller for aggregation. However, performing such
  analytics without overcounting flows or packets that traverse multiple measurement
  switches is challenging. Therefore, existing solutions often simplify the problem
  by making assumptions on the routing or measurement switch placement. We introduce
  AROMA, a measurement infrastructure that generates a uniform sample of packets and
  flows regardless of the topology, workload and routing. Therefore, AROMA can be
  deployed in many settings, and can also work in the data plane using programmable
  PISA switches. The AROMA infrastructure includes controller algorithms that approximate
  a variety of essential measurement tasks while providing formal accuracy guarantees.
  Using extensive simulations on real-world network traces, we show that our algorithms
  are competitively accurate compared to the best existing solutions despite the fact
  that they make no assumptions on the underlying network or the placement of measurement
  switches.

ABS: 'The evaluation of network traffic entropy is very useful for management purposes,
  since it helps to keep track of changes in network flow distribution. Nowadays,
  network traffic entropy is usually estimated in centralized monitoring collectors,
  which require a significant amount of information to be retrieved from switches.
  The advent of programmable data planes in Software-Defined Networks helps mitigate
  this issue, opening the door to the possibility of estimating entropy directly in
  the switches data plane. Unfortunately, the most widely-adopted programming language
  used to program the data plane, called P4, lacks supporting many arithmetic operations
  such as logarithm and exponential function computation, which are necessary for
  entropy estimation. In this paper we propose two new algorithms, called P4Log and
  P4Exp, to fill this gap: these algorithms can estimate logarithms and exponential
  functions with a given precision by only using P4-supported arithmetic operations.
  Additionally, we leverage them to propose a novel strategy, called P4Entropy, to
  estimate traffic entropy entirely in the switch data plane. Results show that P4Entropy
  has comparable accuracy as an existing solution but without (i) constraining the
  number of packets in an observation interval and (ii) requiring the usage of TCAM,
  which is a scarce resource.'

ABS: The depletion of the unallocated IPv4 addresses and the slow pace of IPv6 deployment
  have given rise to the IPv4 transfer market, the trading of allocated IPv4 prefixes
  between organizations. Despite the policies established by RIRs to regulate the
  IPv4 transfer market, IPv4 transfers pose an opportunity for malicious networks,
  such as spammers and bulletproof ASes, to bypass reputational penalties by obtaining
  clean IPv4 address space or by offloading blacklisted addresses. Additionally, IP
  transfers create a window of uncertainty about the legitimate ownership of prefixes,
  which leads to inconsistencies in WHOIS records and routing advertisements. In this
  paper we provide the first detailed study of how transferred IPv4 prefixes are misused
  in the wild, by synthesizing an array of longitudinal IP blacklists, honeypot data,
  and AS reputation lists. Our findings yield evidence that transferred IPv4 address
  blocks are used by malicious networks to address botnets and fraudulent sites in
  much higher rates compared to non-transferred addresses, while the timing of the
  attacks indicate efforts to evade filtering mechanisms.

ABS: The cyberspace continues to evolve more complex than ever anticipated, and same
  is the case with security dynamics there. As our dependence on cyberspace is increasing
  day-by-day, regular and systematic monitoring of cyberspace security has become
  very essential. A darknet is one such monitoring framework for deducing malicious
  activities and the attack patterns in the cyberspace. Darknet traffic is the spurious
  traffic observed in the empty address space, i.e., a set of globally valid Internet
  Protocol (IP) addresses which are not assigned to any hosts or devices. In an ideal
  secure network system, no traffic is expected to arrive on such a darknet IP space.
  However, in reality, noticeable amount of traffic is observed in this space primarily
  due to the Internet wide malicious activities, attacks and sometimes due to the
  network level misconfigurations. Analyzing such traffic and finding distinct attack
  patterns present in them can be a potential mechanism to infer the attack trends
  in the real network. In this paper, the existing Basic and Extended AGgregate and
  Mode (AGM) data formats for darknet traffic analysis is studied and an efficient
  29-tuple Numerical AGM data format suitable for analyzing the source IP address
  validated TCP connections (three-way handshake) is proposed to find attack patterns
  in this traffic using Mean Shift clustering algorithm. Analyzing the patterns detected
  from the clusters results in providing the traces of various attacks such as Mirai
  bot, SQL attack, and brute force. Analyzing the source IP validated TCP, darknet
  traffic is a potential technique in Cyber security to find the attack trends in

  using active probing is challenging due to the IPv6 address space size, wide variety
  of provider addressing and subnetting schemes, and incomplete topology traces. As
  such, existing topology mapping systems can miss the large footprint of the IPv6  periphery,
  disadvantaging applications ranging from IPv6 census studies to geolocation and
  network resilience. We introduce EDGY, an approach to explicitly discover the IPv6
  network periphery, and use it to find > 64M IPv6  periphery router addresses and

ABS: Finding top-k elephant flows is a critical task in network traffic measurement,
  with many applications in congestion control, anomaly detection and traffic engineering.
  As the line rates keep increasing in todays networks, designing accurate and fast
  algorithms for online identification of elephant flows becomes more and more challenging.
  The prior algorithms are seriously limited in achieving accuracy under the constraints
  of heavy traffic and small on-chip memory in use. We observe that the basic strategies
  adopted by these algorithms either require significant space overhead to measure
  the sizes of all flows or incur significant inaccuracy when deciding which flows
  to keep track of. In this paper, we adopt a new strategy, called count-with-exponential-decay,
  to achieve space-accuracy balance by actively removing small flows through decaying,
  while minimizing the impact on large flows, so as to achieve high precision in finding
  top-k elephant flows. Moreover, the proposed algorithm called HeavyKeeper incurs
  small, constant processing overhead per packet and thus supports high line rates.
  Experimental results show that HeavyKeeper algorithm achieves 99.99% precision with
  a small memory size, and reduces the error by around 3 orders of magnitude on average
  compared to the state-of-the-art

ABS: Botnets can be used to launch large scale and expensive attacks. Botnets are
  also difficult to detect and disable, especially when they use peer-to-peer (P2P)
  command and control structures. In this paper we propose GADFly - a fast and robust
  algorithm to detect P2P botnet structures in communication graphs built from network
  flow meta-data. While other algorithms have been proposed in literature that use
  graph analysis or machine learning techniques to detect botnets, they are either
  slow or have impractical false positives for realistically large graphs with millions
  of nodes. They also assume availability of universal communication graph data, which
  is not realistic. The method proposed here is able to precisely detect P2P botnet
  structures with extremely low false positive rates. In addition, GADFly is also
  very fast and robust in the face of gaps in communication graph data, making it
  suitable for practical deployments.

ABS: 'Recently, high performance packet I/O frameworks are expected an extensive application
  for their ability to process packets from 10Gbps or higher speed links. To achieve
  high throughput and low latency, high performance packet I/O frameworks usually
  employ busy polling technique. As busy polling will burn all CPU cycles even if
  theres no packet to process, these frameworks are quite power inefficient. Meanwhile,
  exploiting power management techniques such as DVFS and LPI in high performance
  packet I/O frameworks is challenging, because neither the OS nor the frameworks
  can provide information (e.g., the actual CPU utilization, available idle period,
  or the target frequency) required by power management techniques. In this paper,
  we establish an analytical model that can formulate the packet processing flow of
  high performance packet I/O to help address the above challenges. From the analytical
  model, we can deduce the actual CPU utilization and average idle period in different
  traffic load, and gain the insight to choose CPU frequency that can appropriately
  balance the power consumption and packet latency. Then, we propose two simple but
  effective approaches to conduct power conservation for high performance packet I/O:
  one with the aid of traffic information and the other without. Experiments with
  Intel DPDK show that both approaches can achieve significant power reduction (35.90%
  and 34.43% on average respectively) while incurring < 1 microsec of latency increase.'

ABS: Heavy Hitters refer to the set of flows that represent a significantly large
  proportion of the link capacity or of the active traffic. Identifying Heavy Hitters
  is of particular importance in both network management and security applications.
  Traditional methods are focusing on sampling in the middle box and analyzing those
  packets using streaming algorithms. The paradigm of Software Defined Network (SDN)
  simplifies the work of flow counting. However, continuously monitoring the network
  will introduce overhead, which needs to be considered as a tradeoff between accurate
  measurement in real-time. In this paper, We propose a novel method that stamps each
  suspicious flow with a weight based on an online learning algorithm. The granularity
  of measurement is dynamically changed according to the importance of each flow.
  We take advantage of history flows to make the procedure of finding a heavy hitter
  faster so that applications can make decisions instantly. Using real-world data,
  we show that our online learning method can detect heavy hitters faster with less
  overhead and the same accuracy.

  the number of matching rules a TCAM can support. Therefore, rule caching is needed
  to place high-weight (high-hit) rules in the TCAM hardware, while large, but slow,

ABS: With the rapid and continuous growth of annual network traffic comes the need
  to develop systems that can efficiently scale to meet the demands of analyzing all
  this traffic data. The Hadoop ecosystem provides an environment that is capable
  of addressing this need, because of its horizontal scalability and its data locality
  optimization feature. The latter feature improves parallel analysis of data by placing
  computing tasks within the same node that contains the block of data to be analyzed.
  However, this feature cannot be taken advantage of by those input formats that are
  not splittable within the Hadoop Distributed File System. The PCAP format used for
  capturing network data is one such file format. To address this issue, this paper
  proposes the inclusion of a minimal preprocessing step before PCAP files are fed
  into Hadoop and analyzed using the hcap framework, which is currently the fastest
  framework for analyzing PCAP data in Hadoop. This preprocessing step is designed
  to adapt the PCAP files into properly split blocks in order to take advantage of
  Hadoops data locality optimization feature. Results show a significant improvement
  in query response time with a performance gain of 92%, 89%, 91%, and, 87% for scan,
  aggregate, join, and aggregate-join queries respectively when compared to the original

ABS: 'OpenFlow, the main protocol for software-defined networking, requires large-sized
  rule tables and frequent updating. For fast packet processing, rule tables are often
  implemented with ternary content-addressable memory TCAM in the OpenFlow. To deal
  with TCAM power problems, many network applications employ bloom filters BFs to
  reduce the redundant operations of table-lookup and for low power consumption. However,
  applying traditional BFs to an OpenFlow switch leads to problems, such as unsupported
  dynamic update, large space overhead, and the rule-set expansion of ternary data.
  In this paper, we propose a dynamically updatable ternary segmented aging bloom
  filter TSA-BF. The TSA-BF consists of two parts: a segmented aging BF algorithm
  SA-BF and a ternary prefix-tagging encoder TPE. First, in the SA-BF, we develop
  an automatic update scheme using the mechanisms of content-aging and buffer-segmenting.
  The SA-BF ages and deletes its contents automatically, thus eliminating the costly
  communication overhead and enabling dynamic updating. It also achieves space efficiency
  by the developed partial-deletion mechanism. Second, in the TPE, we encode ternary
  prefix-rules into uniquely decodable binary code words. The TPE prevents the rule-set
  expansion of ternary-data in the OpenFlow environment. Simulation results show that
  the SA-BF alone can save 37% of space overhead, compared with state-of-the-art techniques.
  In an environment with the ternary prefix-rules, the TSA-BF can save another 93%
  of space overhead, compared with the best-performance scheme. Hence, the proposed
  TSA-BF is highly suited to the requirements of emerging high-performance TCAM-based
  packet processing in the OpenFlow, which considers dynamic update and power efficiency.'

ABS: Research in network traffic measurement and analysis is a long-lasting field
  with growing interest from both scientists and the industry. However, even after
  so many years, results replication, criticism, and review are still rare. We face
  not only a lack of research standards, but also inaccessibility of appropriate datasets
  that can be used for methods development and evaluation. Therefore, a lot of potentially
  high-quality research cannot be verified and is not adopted by the industry or the
  community. The aim of this paper is to overcome this controversy with a unique solution
  based on a combination of distinct approaches proposed by other research works.
  Unlike these studies, we focus on the whole issue covering all areas of data anonymization,
  authenticity, recency, publicity, and their usage for research provability. We believe
  that these challenges can be solved by utilization of semi-labeled datasets composed
  of real-world network traffic and annotated units with interest-related packet traces
  only. In this paper, we outline the basic ideas of the methodology from unit trace
  collection and semi-labeled dataset creation to its usage for research evaluation.
  We strive for this proposal to start a discussion of the approach and help to overcome
  some of the challenges the research faces today.

ABS: 'The mission of set reconciliation (also called set synchronization) is to identify
  those elements which appear only in exactly one of two given sets. In this paper,
  we extend the set reconciliation problem into three design rationales: (i) multiset
  support; (ii) near 100 percent reconciliation accuracy; and (iii) communication-friendly
  and time-saving. These three rationales, if realized, will lead to unprecedented
  benefits for the set reconciliation paradigm. Generally, prior reconciliation methods
  are mainly designed for simple sets and thus remain inapplicable for multisets.
  Methods based on probabilistic data structures, e.g., the Counting Bloom Filter
  (CBF), support efficient representation, and multiplicity queries. Based on these
  probabilistic data structures, approximate multiset reconciliation can be enabled.
  However, they often cannot achieve a statisfying accuracy, due to potential hash
  collisions. The reconciliations enabled by logs or lists incur high time-complexity
  and communication overhead. Therefore, existing reconciliation methods, fail to
  realize the three rationales simultaneously. To this end, we redesign Trie and Fenwick
  Tree (FT), to near-accurately represent and reconcile two types of multisets that
  we refer to as unsorted and sorted multisets, respectively. Moreover, to further
  reduce the communication overhead during the reconciliation process, we design a
  partial transmission strategy when exchanging two Tries or FTs. Comprehensive evaluations
  are conducted to quantify the performance of our proposals. The trace-driven evaluations
  demonstrate that Trie and FT achieve near-accurate multiset reconciliation, with
  4.31 and 2.96 times faster than the CBF-based method, respectively. The simulations
  based on synthetic datasets further indicate that our proposals outperform the CBF-based
  method in terms of accuracy and communication overhead at most time.'

ABS: The recent introduction of SDN allows deploying new centralized network algorithms
  that dramatically improve the network operation. Many of these solutions rely on
  the assumption that the centralized controller merges data from different Network
  Monitoring Points (NMP) to obtain a network-wide view. This is far from trivial
  when the same packet may traverse through several NMPs. Therefore, existing solutions
  either assume that each packet is measured at exactly one NMP or that the routing
  of each packet is known. Another approach is to mark the sampled packets so that
  other NMPs are aware that the packet was already considered. We suggest the first
  network-wide and routing oblivious algorithms for three fundamental network monitoring
  problems. The suggested algorithms allow flexible NMP placement, require no control
  over edge routers, and are indifferent to network topology and routing. Moreover,
  they are based on passive measurements without modifying the traffic in any way.
  Formally, we provide a general, constant time framework that solves the distributed
  versions of the volume estimation, frequency estimation and heavy-hitters problems
  with provable guarantees. The evaluation of our scheme on real packet traces shows
  that we can achieve very accurate results using a very reasonable amount of memory.
  For example, using less than 60KB memory in each monitoring point we get a root
  square error of less than 0.01% of the packets for frequency estimation.

ABS: 'New Ethernet standards, such as 40 GbE or 100 GbE, are already being deployed
  commercially along with their corresponding Network Interface Cards (NICs) for the
  servers. However, network measurement solutions are lagging behind: while there
  are several tools available for monitoring 10 or 20 Gbps networks, higher speeds
  pose a harder challenge that requires more new ideas, different from those applied
  previously, and so there are less applications available. In this paper, we show
  a system capable of capturing, timestamping and storing 40 Gbps network traffic
  using a tailored network driver together with Non-Volatile Memory express (NVMe)
  technology and the Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK) framework. Also, we
  expose core ideas that can be extended for the capture at higher rates: a multicore
  architecture capable of synchronization with minimal overhead that reduces disordering
  of the received frames, methods to filter the traffic discarding unwanted frames
  without being computationally expensive, and the use of an intermediate buffer that
  allows simultaneous access from several applications to the same data and efficient
  disk writes. Finally, we show a testbed for a reliable benchmarking of our solution
  using custom DPDK traffic generators and replayers, which have been made freely

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the major threats to the Internet
  security. Various DDoS attacks have been reported against many organizations in
  recent years. There have been numerous studies investigating the effects of utilizing
  classification algorithms to detect and prevent DDoS attacks. However, the existing
  research has many obstacles including the achievement of practical performance rates
  of the detection system, the delay of detection, as well as the ability to deal
  with the large dataset. In this research, we propose a DDoS detection framework
  that mainly consists of Gradient Boosting classification algorithm (GBT) and the
  Apache Processing Engine Spark. Experimental results conducted in a Spark and Hadoop
  cluster, for evaluating the proposed framework regarding the performances as well
  as the delays using a real DDoS Dataset, show that the integration of the GBT algorithm
  with Apache Spark works excellently to detect DDoS attack. The volume of the dataset
  and the features space, as well as the depth of decision trees and number of iterations
  parameters, have a direct impact on the GBT algorithm performance rates and the
  delays.

ABS: The detection of network flows that send excessive amounts of traffic is of increasing
  importance to enforce QoS and to counter DDoS attacks. Large-flow detection has
  been previously explored, but the proposed approaches can be used on high-capacity
  core routers only at the cost of significantly reduced accuracy, due to their otherwise
  too high memory and processing overhead. We propose CLEF, a new large-flow detection
  scheme with low memory requirements, which maintains high accuracy under the strict
  conditions of high-capacity core routers. We compare our scheme with previous proposals
  through extensive theoretical analysis, and with an evaluation based on worst-case-scenario
  attack traffic. We show that CLEF outperforms previously proposed systems in settings
  with limited memory.

ABS: Network data volumes have seen a substantial increase in recent years, in part
  due to the massive use of mobile devices, the dissemination of streaming services
  and the rise of concepts such as IoT. This growing trend highlights the need to
  improve network monitoring systems to cope with challenges related with performance,
  flexibility and security. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and traffic sampling
  techniques can be combined to provide a toolset that can be used for enhancing network
  management activities and performance evaluation. In this context, this paper presents
  a proposal for supporting timebased sampling techniques in SDN, providing network
  statistics at the controller level and allowing the self-configuration of traffic
  sampling in network devices. The proposed solution, designed to improve the efficiency
  and flexibility of network measurement systems, takes into account the underlying
  need to establish a balance between the reliability of the collected data and the
  computational effort involved in the sampling process. The proof-of-concept results
  emphasize the potential of applying and configuring different time-based sampling
  techniques through a SDN framework and a small set of standard Open-Flow messages.
  Comparative results on the accuracy and overhead of each technique when sampling
  real traffic traces are also provided.

ABS: Flow-based load balancing exploits the parallelism of network traffic to improve
  forwarding performance. However, in programmable data planes, the concept of flow
  has been changed, which undermines the premise of hashing-based load balancing.
  The current network hashing algorithms such as Toeplitz and CRC16 cannot recognize
  the flow containing different packets, may resulting in forwarding performance degradation.
  In this study, we introduced an approach based on the locality sensitive hashing
  to the failure at flow recognition. We proved that bit sampling achieves a higher
  probability that packets belonging to the same flow are mapped to the same queue
  than Toeplitz and random algorithm. To guarantee the load balancing performance
  of bit sampling, we proposed a method for bits selection. The experimental results
  showed that bit sampling could improve the probability by at least 55% over current
  network hashing algorithms while maintaining competitive load-balancing performance.

ABS: Recently, TCP SYN flood has been the most common and serious type of Distributed
  Denial of Service attack that causes outages of server resource of Internet Service
  Providers. In another aspect, Software Defined Networking (SDN) has emerged as a
  new networking paradigm to increase network agility and programmability. SDN is
  also a promising architecture to deal with the network security issue where we can
  flexibly change security rules and control incoming flows. In this article, we design
  an Openflow/SDN network remedy to combat specifically TCP SYN flood. We show security
  threats for the SDN architecture and exploit SDN capabilities and features to design
  a SDN-based SYN Proxy (SSP) paradigm to mitigate such TCP SYN threats. Our SSP is
  proved to be a network-based solution to protect application servers in terms of
  decreasing number of Half-Open Connections at an application server and increasing
  probability of successful establishment for a TCP flow connection under TCP SYN
  Flood attack. Using SSP to support application servers is shown to outperform the
  case where the servers adopt only the protection scheme of Microsoft Windows server
  reference model without utilizing SSP. SSP also shows that it can reduce the time
  a flow entry occupies the switch resource by 94% in comparison with the Avant-Guard
  solution. In addition, SSP improves the successful connection rate and average connection
  retrieval time in comparison with the standard Openflow solution.

ABS: Traditional Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSes) are generally implemented
  on vendor proprietary appliances or middleboxes with poor versatility and flexibility.
  Emerging Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
  technologies can virtualize NIDSes and elastically scale them to deal with attack
  traffic variations. However, such an elasticity feature must not come at the cost
  of decreased detection effectiveness and expensive provisioning. In this paper,
  we propose an innovative NIDS architecture, vNIDS, to enable safe and efficient
  virtualization of NIDSes. vNIDS addresses two key challenges with respect to effective
  intrusion detection and non-monolithic NIDS provisioning in virtualizing NIDSes.
  The former challenge is addressed by detection state sharing while minimizing the
  sharing overhead in virtualized environments. In particular, static program analysis
  is employed to determine which detection states need to be shared. vNIDS addresses
  the latter challenge by provisioning virtual NIDSes as microservices and employing
  program slicing to partition the detection logic programs so that they can be executed
  by each microservice separately. We implement a prototype of vNIDS to demonstrate
  the feasibility of our approach. Our evaluation results show that vNIDS could offer
  both effective intrusion detection and efficient provisioning for NIDS virtualization.

ABS: Flow correlation is the core technique used in a multitude of deanonymization
  attacks on Tor. Despite the importance of flow correlation attacks on Tor, existing
  flow correlation techniques are considered to be ineffective and unreliable in linking
  Tor flows when applied at a large scale, i.e., they impose high rates of false positive
  error rates or require impractically long flow observations to be able to make reliable
  correlations. In this paper, we show that, unfortunately, flow correlation attacks
  can be conducted on Tor traffic with drastically higher accuracies than before by
  leveraging emerging learning mechanisms. We particularly design a system, called
  DeepCorr, that outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant margins in correlating
  Tor connections. DeepCorr leverages an advanced deep learning architecture to learn
  a flow correlation function tailored to Tors complex network- this is in contrast
  to previous works use of generic statistical correlation metrics to correlate Tor
  flows. We show that with moderate learning, DeepCorr can correlate Tor connections
  (and therefore break its anonymity) with accuracies significantly higher than existing
  algorithms, and using substantially shorter lengths of flow observations. For instance,
  by collecting only about 900 packets of each target Tor flow (roughly 900KB of Tor
  data), DeepCorr provides a flow correlation accuracy of 96% compared to 4% by the
  state-of-the-art system of RAPTOR using the same exact setting. We hope that our
  work demonstrates the escalating threat of flow correlation attacks on Tor given
  recent advances in learning algorithms, calling for the timely deployment of effective
  countermeasures by the Tor community.

ABS: Programmable network switches promise flexibility and high throughput, enabling
  applications such as load balancing and traffic engineering. Network measurement
  is a fundamental building block for such applications, including tasks such as the
  identification of heavy hitters (largest flows) or the detection of traffic changes.
  However, high-throughput packet processing architectures place certain limitations
  on the programming model, such as restricted branching, limited capability for memory
  access, and a limited number of processing stages. These limitations restrict the
  types of measurement algorithms that can run on programmable switches. In this paper,
  we focus on the RMT programmable high-throughput switch architecture, and carefully
  examine its constraints on designing measurement algorithms. We demonstrate our
  findings while solving the heavy hitter problem. We introduce PRECISION, an algorithm
  that uses Probabilistic Recirculation to find top flows on a programmable switch.
  By recirculating a small fraction of packets, PRECISION simplifies the access to
  stateful memory to conform with RMT limitations and achieves higher accuracy than
  previous heavy hitter detection algorithms that avoid recirculation. We also analyze
  the effect of each architectural constraint on the measurement accuracy and provide
  insights for measurement algorithm designers.

ABS: 'WANs are often over-provisioned to accommodate worst-case operating conditions,

  show that in-network congestion management can play an important role in increasing
  network utilization. To mitigate the effects of in-network congestion caused by
  rapid variations in traffic demand, we propose using high-frequency traffic control
  (HFTraC) algorithms that exchange real-time flow rate and buffer occupancy information
  between routers to dynamically coordinate their link-service rates. We show that
  the design of such dynamic link-service rate policies can be cast as a distributed
  optimal control problem that allows us to systematically explore an enlarged design
  space of in-network congestion management algorithms. This also provides a means
  of quantitatively comparing different controller architectures: we show, perhaps
  surprisingly, that centralized control is not always better. We implement and evaluate
  HFTraC in the face of rapidly varying UDP and TCP flows and in combination with
  AQM algorithms. Using a custom experimental testbed, a Mininet emulator, and a production
  WAN, we show that HFTraC leads to up to 66% decreases in packet loss rates at high
  link utilizations as compared to FIFO policies.'

  applications where the traffic is more bursty, by proposing a packet management
  scheme with adaptive expiration times, determined in response to local and/or global
  queue sizes. The exact relation is found using a direct optimisation method which
  uses a simulation. We show that thanks to the regulation of the expiration time,
  an N-GREEN ring may continuously adapt to a bursty/unpredictable traffic of a varying
  average load, provided the nodes inform one another about the momentary size of
  data in their input buffers. The adaptation may considerably decrease the latency
  of the network.

  is complementary to existing counter solutions. We pose and formulate the problem
  of finding the optimal placement for duplicated counting rules. After proving its
  NP hardness, we give some heuristics to fast generate a near-optimal placement.
  After describing the feasibility of implementation, we carry out some evaluation
  for DIAL. Our simulated results with Internet traffic and topologies show that DIAL
  can significantly decrease the memory cost and increase the memory efficiency for
  both fixed-width and variable-width counter architecture, with acceptable extra
  overheads, which is a great save of the precious high-speed memory in the switch.

ABS: The rise of programmable switches and P4 brings much flexibility to networks,
  but this flexibility comes with increased risks of bugs. Diagnosing these bugs is
  essential for network operation but is non-trivial. A potential approach is to track
  packet behaviors through postcards, but existing tools either generate substantial
  postcards (limited scalability) or only track a small proportion of packet behaviors
  (low coverage). In this paper, we present KeySight, a platform that troubleshoots
  programmable switches with high scalability and high coverage. The key idea is based
  on the Packet Equivalence Class (PEC) abstraction that aggregates packets with identical
  behaviors and generates one postcard per behavior. The PEC abstraction minimizes
  the number of postcards while tracking all packet behaviors. We design novel algorithms
  to analyze PECs of P4 programs and to implement the PEC abstraction on programmable
  switches. We deploy KeySight on Tofino and SmartNIC, and evaluate it against 80
  P4 programs and real packet traces of over 5TB. Results show that in the premise
  of overseeing over 99.9% packet behaviors, KeySight reduces the number of postcards
  by one to two orders of magnitude when comparing with NetSight.

ABS: We have analyzed network traces of TCP connections and observed that there are
  many more losses during the handshake than for the remainder of the data exchange.
  Although recently developed AQM schemes can efficiently reduce latency related to
  bufferbloat, only more complex solutions relying on Fair Queueing (FQ) can improve
  the long delays resulting from the loss of a packet during the establishment of
  a TCP connection. In this paper, we propose SPA (SYN Priority Active queue management),
  a new low-complexity queue management scheme that combines the benefits and simplicity
  of the most recent AQM schemes while achieving performance comparable to more complex
  combinations of Fair Queueing and AQM. Our evaluation shows that the SPA performance
  is close to FQ CoDel for only a fraction of the complexity and resource usage.

ABS: A distributed join is a fundamental operation for processing massive datasets
  in parallel. Unfortunately, computing an equi-join over such datasets is very resource-intensive,
  even when done in parallel. Given this cost, the equi-join operator becomes a natural
  candidate for optimization using approximation techniques, which allow users to
  trade accuracy for latency. Finding the right approximation technique for joins,
  however, is a challenging task. Sampling, in particular, cannot be directly used
  in joins; naively performing a join over a sample of the dataset will not preserve
  statistical properties of the query result. To address this problem, we introduce
  ApproxJoin. We interweave Bloom filter sketching and stratified sampling with the
  join computation in a new operator that preserves statistical properties of an aggregation
  over the join output. ApproxJoin leverages Bloom filters to avoid shuffling non-joinable
  data items around the network, and then applies stratified sampling to obtain a
  representative sample of the join output. We implemented ApproxJoin in Apache Spark,
  and evaluated it using microbenchmarks and real-world workloads. Our evaluation
  shows that ApproxJoin scales well and significantly reduces data movement, without
  sacrificing tight error bounds on the accuracy of the final results. ApproxJoin
  achieves a speedup of up to 9x over unmodified Spark-based joins with the same sampling
  ratio. Furthermore, the speedup is accompanied by a significant reduction in the
  shuffled data volume, which is up to 82x less than unmodified Spark-based joins.

ABS: This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of a system to implement
  complex congestion control functions by placing them in a separate agent outside
  the datapath. Each datapath---such as the Linux kernel TCP, UDP-based QUIC, or kernel-bypass
  transports like mTCP-on-DPDK---summarizes information about packet round-trip times,
  receptions, losses, and ECN via a well-defined interface to algorithms running in
  the off-datapath Congestion Control Plane (CCP). The algorithms use this information
  to control the datapaths congestion window or pacing rate. Algorithms written in
  CCP can run on multiple datapaths. CCP improves both the pace of development and
  ease of maintenance of congestion control algorithms by providing better, modular
  abstractions, and supports aggregation capabilities of the Congestion Manager, all
  with one-time changes to datapaths. CCP also enables new capabilities, such as Copa
  in Linux TCP, several algorithms running on QUIC and mTCP/DPDK, and the use of signal
  processing algorithms to detect whether cross-traffic is ACK-clocked. Experiments
  with our user-level Linux CCP implementation show that CCP algorithms behave similarly
  to kernel algorithms, and incur modest CPU overhead of a few percent.

ABS: This work considers performance analysis of chaff-based traffic obfuscation against
  a passive adversary aiming to obtain contextual information, e.g. such as the protocol
  being used. The obfuscation could be either in terms of chaff bytes which are dummy
  bytes appended to packets of the intended traffic stream, or chaff packets which
  are dummy packets again inserted in specific intervals of the original packet stream.
  Despite consisting of dummy bytes, chaff deployment still results in additional
  resource consumption and potential drawbacks, and hence has to be deployed in a
  controlled manner. We first define notions of vulnerability of traffic patterns
  in terms of contextual privacy. Next, we fix the adversary and focus on optimal
  allocation of the chaff resources among the traffic to be obfuscated. For adversaries
  which perform statistical characterization based on packet sizes and interarrival
  times, we derive chaff placement algorithms based on the waterfilling algorithm
  commonly used in the field of information theory. We apply our derived algorithms
  to representative real-world scenarios to obfuscate certain applications vulnerable
  to contextual privacy leakage.

ABS: Network measurement is challenged to fulfill stringent resource requirements
  in the face of massive network traffic. While approximate measurement can trade
  accuracy for resource savings, it demands intensive manual efforts to configure
  the right resource-accuracy trade-offs in real deployment. Such user burdens are
  caused by how existing approximate measurement approaches inherently deal with resource
  conflicts when tracking massive network traffic with limited resources. In particular,
  they tightly couple resource configurations with accuracy parameters, so as to provision
  sufficient resources to bound the measurement errors. We design SketchLearn, a novel
  sketch-based measurement framework that resolves resource conflicts by learning
  their statistical properties to eliminate conflicting traffic components. We prototype
  SketchLearn on OpenVSwitch and P4, and our testbed experiments and stress-test simulation
  show that SketchLearn accurately and automatically monitors various traffic statistics
  and effectively supports network-wide measurement with limited resources.

ABS: With the centralized management paradigm offered by the recent IEEE 802.11 products,
  it is now easier and more efficient to optimize associations between access points
  (APs) and stations. Most of the optimization approaches consider a saturated network.
  Even if such traffic conditions are rare, the optimization of the association step
  under this assumption has the benefit to fairly share the bandwidth between stations.
  Nevertheless, traffic demands may be very different from one station to another
  and it may be more useful to optimize associations according to the stations demands.
  In this paper, we propose an optimization of the association step based on the stations
  throughputs and the channel busy time fraction (BTF). The latter is defined as the
  proportion of time the channel is sensed busy by an AP. Associations are optimized
  in order to minimize the greatest BTF in the network. This original approach allows
  the Wi-Fi manager/controller to unload the most congested AP, increase the throughput
  for most of the stations, and offer more bandwidth to stations that need it. We
  present a local search technique that finds local optima to this optimization problem.
  This heuristic relies on an analytical model that predicts BTF for any configuration.
  The model is based on a Markov network and a Wi-Fi conflict graph. NS-3 simulations
  including a large set of scenarios highlight the benefits of our approach and its
  ability to improve the performance in congested and non-congested Wi-Fi networks.

ABS: Bloom filters BFs are widely used in many network applications but the high computational
  cost limits the system performance. In this paper, we introduce a low computational
  cost Bloom filter named One-Hashing Bloom filter OHBF to solve the problem. The
  OHBF requires only one base hash function plus a few simple modulo operations to
  implement a Bloom filter. While keeping nearly the same theoretical false positive
  ratio as a Standard Bloom filter SBF, the OHBF significantly reduces the computational
  overhead of the hash functions. We show that the practical false positive ratio
  of an SBF implementation strongly relies on the selection of hash functions, even
  if these hash functions are considered good. In contrast, the practical false positive
  ratio of an OHBF implementation is consistently close to its theoretical bound.
  The stable false positive performance of the OHBF can be precisely derived from
  a proved mathematical foundation. As the OHBF has reduced computational overhead,
  it is ideal for high throughput and low-latency applications. We use a case study
  to show the advantages of the OHBF. In a BF-based FIB lookup system, the lookup
  throughput of OHBF-based solution can achieve twice as fast as the SBF-based solution.

ABS: Low-rate Distributed Denial of Service (LDoS) attack is another form of DDoS
  attack for disrupting the cloud services. It differs from DDoS attack in terms of
  attack volume. DDoS attacks usually have very high attack volume; however, LDoS
  have very low attack rate. Moreover, these attacks are launched periodically with
  high narrow spike and low frequency. The behavior of the LDoS attack traffic is
  very much close to the behavior of the normal traffic; therefore LDoS attacks are
  capable to bypass the DDoS detection system. Therefore, low-rate DDoS attacks can
  persist for longer time and endanger the victim. LDoS attacks fraudulently consume
  the cloud resources for prolonged period of time which raises the economic concerns
  of cloud-based service providers. This paper presents an effective approach to detect
  the presence of LDoS attack flow in cloud computing. The proposed approach perform
  hypothesis test based on t-statistic to identify the LDoS attack flows. To verify
  the claims made in the paper and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
  approach, several experiments are done with the help of suitable benchmark datasets.

ABS: Distributed denial of service attack has become a challenging threat in todays
  Internet. The adversaries often use spoofed IP addresses, which in turn makes the
  defense process very difficult. The sophistication of the attack is increasing due
  to the difficulty in tracing back the origin of attack. The researchers have contributed
  many traceback schemes to find out the origin of such attacks. In the majority of
  the existing methods they either mark the packets or log the hash digest of the
  packets at the routers in the attack path, which is computational and storage intensive.
  The proposed IP trace back scheme is an User Datagram Protocol based (UDP) approach
  using packet marking which requires computation and storage only at the edge router
  and victim and hence it does not overload the intermediate routers in the attack
  path. Unlike existing traceback schemes which requires numerous packets to traceback
  an attacker, the proposed scheme requires only a single trace information marked
  packet to identify an attacker. It supports incremental deployment which is a desirable
  characteristic of a practical traceback scheme. The work was simulated with real
  time Internet dataset from the Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis
  (CAIDA) and found that the storage requirement at the victim is less than 1.2 MB
  which is nearly 3413 times lesser than the existing related packet marking method.
  It was also implemented in real time in the experimental DDoS Test Bed the efficacy

ABS: Cloud Computing services are often delivered through HTTP protocol. This facilitates
  access to services and reduces costs for both providers and end-users. However,
  this increases the vulnerabilities of the Cloud services face to HTTP DDoS attacks.
  HTTP request methods are often used to address web servers vulnerabilities and create
  multiple scenarios of HTTP DDoS attack such as Low and Slow or Flooding attacks.
  Existing HTTP DDoS detection systems are challenged by the big amounts of network
  traffic generated by these attacks, low detection accuracy, and high false positive
  rates. In this paper we present a detection system of HTTP DDoS attacks in a Cloud
  environment based on Information Theoretic Entropy and Random Forest ensemble learning
  algorithm. A time-based sliding window algorithm is used to estimate the entropy
  of the network header features of the incoming network traffic. When the estimated
  entropy exceeds its normal range the preprocessing and the classification tasks
  are triggered. To assess the proposed approach various experiments were performed
  on the CIDDS-001 public dataset. The proposed approach achieves satisfactory results
  with an accuracy of 99.54%, a FPR of 0.4%, and a running time of 18.5s.

  in causing the attack. Based on the attack model we have analysed the statistical
  parameters of the incoming packets such as inter-arrival time, the probability of
  uniqueness of an IP address in given time frame and the unavailability of HTTP (Hyper
  Text Transfer Protocol) GET acknowledgment bit in the header field. These parameters
  are the input to the Fuzzy classification model. We have used Genetic Algorithm
  (GA) to provide an optimised value range for the input parameters. The optimised
  values are now applied to Fuzzy logic to identify whether the web accessing clients
  shows the behavior of attack, normal or FE. The experimental results show that Fuzzy-GA

ABS: With the prosperity of wireless networks, vehicular networks (VNs) have been
  extensively studied in recent years. It is deployed to ensure road safety, enhance
  the driving experience, and reduce traffic congestion. However, VNs are vulnerable
  to various attacks, especially Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) that attackers
  control a large number of compromise nodes inside the networks to occupy the network
  resources of legitimate users and impact the communication among vehicles and between
  vehicles and infrastructure. In this paper, we design a platform to efficiently
  detect and rapidly respond to the DDoS attack in VNs based on software-defined networking
  (SDN). The proposed platform not only contains the trigger mechanism based on the
  message of OpenFlow protocol (i.e., PACKET_IN message) for a response not timely
  but also involves a flow feature extraction strategy based on the multi-dimensional
  information. Moreover, we construct an effective global network flow table feature
  values based on OpenFlow flow table feature and the entropy feature of flow table
  entry. We determine all flow table entry by the trained SVM. By analyzing the simulation
  results, we verify that the detection scheme effectively reduces the time for starting
  attack detection and classification recognition and has a lower false alarm rate.

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are performed from multiple agents
  towards a single victim. Essentially, all attacking agents generate multiple packets
  towards the victim to overwhelm it with requests, thereby overloading the resources
  of the victim. Since it is very complex and expensive to conduct a real DDoS attack,
  most organizations and researchers result in using simulations to mimic an actual
  attack. The researchers come up with diverse algorithms and mechanisms for attack
  detection and prevention. Further, simulation is good practice for determining the
  efficacy of an intrusive detective measure against DDoS attacks. However, some mechanisms
  are ineffective and thus not applied in real life attacks. Nowadays, DDoS attack
  has become more complex and modern for most IDS to detect. Adjustable and configurable
  traffic generator is becoming more and more important. This paper first details
  the available datasets that scholars use for DDoS attack detection. The paper further
  depicts the a few tools that exist freely and commercially for use in the simulation
  programs of DDoS attacks. In addition, a traffic generator for normal and different
  types of DDoS attack has been developed. The aim of the paper is to simulate a cloud
  environment by OMNET++ simulation tool, with different DDoS attack types. Generation
  normal and attack traffic can be useful to evaluate developing IDS for DDoS attacks
  detection. Moreover, the result traffic can be useful to test an effective algorithm,
  techniques and procedures of DDoS attacks.

ABS: 'Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) has caused major damage to cloud computing,
  and the false- and missing-alarm rates of existing DDoS attack-detection methods
  are relatively high in cloud environment. In this paper, we propose a DDoS attack-detection
  method with enhanced random forest (RF) optimized by genetic algorithm based on
  flow correlation degree (FCD) feature. We define the FCD feature according to the
  asymmetric and semidirectivity interaction characteristics and use the two-tuples
  FCD feature consisting of packet-statistical degree (PSD) and semidirectivity interaction
  abnormality (SDIA) to describe the features of attack flow and normal flow. Then
  we use a genetic algorithm based on the FCD feature sequences to optimize two key
  parameters of the decision tree in the RF: the maximum number of decision trees
  and the maximum depth of every single decision tree. We apply the trained RF model
  with optimized parameters to generate the classifier to be used for DDoS attack-detection.
  The experiment shows that the proposed method can effectively detect DDoS attacks
  in cloud environment with a higher accuracy rate and lower false- and missing-alarm
  rates compared to existing DDoS attack-detection methods.'

ABS: Intrusion detection/prevention is the greatest security challenge at virtual
  network layer of Cloud computing. To address this challenge, there have been several
  security frameworks reported. However, still there is a scope of addressing newer
  challenges. Here, we propose a security framework to detect network intrusions in
  Cloud computing. This framework uses Snort and combination of different classifiers,
  viz Bayesian, Associative and Decision tree. We deploy our intrusion detection system
  (IDS) sensors on each host machine of Cloud. These sensors correlate intrusive alerts
  from each region of Cloud in order to identify distributed attacks. For feasibly
  analysis and functional validation of this framework, we perform different experiments
  in real time and offline simulation.

ABS: In this work, we address the problem of detecting application-layer attacks on
  nearby wireless devices. In particular, we assume that the detection scheme is limited
  to link-layer traffic (either because schemes such as WPA2 are used, and the key
  is unknown, or to preserve user privacy). Such a setting allows us to detect attacks
  in nearby third party networks that we are not associated with, unlike related work
  that relies on wireline taps to observe traffic. We propose and implement a framework
  consisting of an anomaly detection module (unsupervised), and an attack classification
  module that identifies a known set of attacks (supervised). We evaluate our prototype
  with experiments including a range of attacks. For example, we demonstrate that
  the anomaly detector detects Mirai C&C traffic by an IoT device (without training
  with Mirai). In addition, we detect that the Mirai infected device is attacking
  other devices with 96.1% accuracy. We show that our prototype can be applied to
  different wireless standards (such as 802.11 (WiFi) and 802.15 (Zigbee)) and detect
  attacks with an accuracy of 96%-99%.

ABS: DDoS attacks have impaired the network availability seriously in the new network
  environment and the traditional network situation assessment methods cannot effectively
  evaluate the DDoS attack security situation. In this paper, a DDoS attack security
  situation assessment model using fusion feature based on Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering
  algorithm has been proposed. This model generates a fusion feature according to
  network flow changes in IP address of old and new users, and calculates the risk
  index of each network node on the basis of fusion feature and obtains the security
  situation information of the whole network by fusing the risk indexes of all network
  nodes, and clusters the fusion situation information with FCM into five security
  levels, so as to quantitatively evaluate the DDoS attack security situation of the
  whole network through the proposed situation risk degree recognition model. Experiments
  on real DDoS data show that the proposed model can assess the DDoS attack security
  situation reasonably and effectively and be more flexible than non-fuzzy methods.

ABS: The Internet of Things [IoT] promises to revolutionize the way we interact with
  our surroundings. Smart cars, smart cities, smart homes are now being realized with
  the help of various embedded devices that operate with little to no human interaction.
  However these embedded devices bring forth a plethora of security challenges as
  most manufacturers still assign higher importance to the three Ps (prototyping,
  production and performance) than security. This inherent flaw has manifested itself
  in the form of various Denial of Service (DoS) attacks orchestrated with the help
  of unsolicited IoT devices on the Internet. We are even seeing massive throughputs
  without the need for amplifications affecting large scale infrastructures on the
  Internet. Thus, understanding the nature of these attacks and quickly identifying
  infected devices becomes imperative to combat this situation. In this paper we present
  a model to classify unsolicited IoT devices in enterprises using machine learning
  (ML). Namely IP header information from darknet data is collected for analysis.
  We then consider multiple supervised ML algorithms to classify these Layer 3 headers.
  We evaluate these algorithms and compare their performances in terms of accurately
  identifying activities of malicious IoT devices on the Internet. Our results show
  that Random Forest and Gradient Boosting have high recall and precision scores whereas
  NaiveBayes has the worst performance. We believe our model can be used by enterprises
  as a part of their intrusion detection system to quickly identify infected IoT devices
  within their own environment as well as identify scanning activities directed towards
  them.

ABS: We propose a mechanism to detect multi-scale low-rate DDoS attacks which uses
  a generalized total variation metric. The proposed metric is highly sensitive towards
  detecting different variations in the network traffic and evoke more distance between
  legitimate and attack traffic as compared to the other detection mechanisms. Most
  low-rate attackers invade the security system by scale-in-and-out of periodic packet
  burst towards the bottleneck router which severely degrades the Quality of Service
  (QoS) of TCP applications. Our proposed mechanism can effectively identify attack
  traffic of this natures, despite its similarity to legitimate traffic, based on
  the spacing value of our metric. We evaluated our mechanism using datasets from
  CAIDA DDoS, MIT Lincoln Lab, and real-time testbed traffic. Our results demonstrate
  that our mechanism exhibits good accuracy and scalability in the detection of multi-scale
  low-rate DDoS attacks.

ABS: The ever rising attacks on IT infrastructure, especially on networks has become
  the cause of anxiety for the IT professionals and the people venturing in the cyber-world.
  There are numerous instances wherein the vulnerabilities in the network has been
  exploited by the attackers leading to huge financial loss. Distributed denial of
  service (DDoS) is one of the most indirect security attack on computer networks.
  Many active computer bots or zombies start flooding the servers with requests, but
  due to its distributed nature throughout the Internet, it cannot simply be terminated
  at server side. Once the DDoS attack initiates, it causes huge overhead to the servers
  in terms of its processing capability and service delivery. Though, the study and
  analysis of request packets may help in distinguishing the legitimate users from
  among the malicious attackers but such detection becomes non-viable due to continuous
  flooding of packets on servers and eventually leads to denial of service to the
  authorized users. In the present research, we propose traffic flow and flow count
  variable based prevention mechanism with the difference in homogeneity. Its simplicity
  and practical approach facilitates the detection of DDoS attack at the early stage
  which helps in prevention of the attack and the subsequent damage. Further, simulation
  result based on different instances of time has been shown on T-value including
  generation of simple and harmonic homogeneity for observing the real time request
  difference and gaps.

ABS: Because of the dynamic nature of network traffic patterns, such as new traffic
  application arrivals or flash events, it is becoming increasingly difficult for
  conventional anomaly detection systems to separate various applications based on
  their traffic patterns. In this paper, by leveraging transport layer packet-level
  and flow-level features, new structures called application fingerprints are generated,
  which express such features in a compact and efficient manner. Based on the generated
  fingerprints, we propose a novel traffic classification framework. The proposed
  system generates profiles of normal applications using a multi-modal probability
  distribution. The proposed classification framework is then extended to detect distributed
  denial of service attacks from the collected statistical information at flow level.
  To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system, we evaluate its performance
  using five real-world traffic datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed
  method is capable of achieving an accuracy of over 97%, whereas the misclassification
  rate is only 2.5%.

ABS: The distributed nature of cloud computing makes it vulnerable and prone to sophisticated
  distributed intrusion attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
  In order to detect those network attacks and respond swiftly, there must be a reliable
  defense system designed to distinguish anomalies embedded in legitimate traffic.
  In order to ensure the high availability of any offered services, the data center
  resources must be protected from DDoS threats. The existing solutions for monitoring
  incoming traffic and detecting DDoS attacks have excessive false alarms and become
  ineffective in early detection of high level flooding attacks and resolution of
  the cloud service availability issues. Therefore, it is necessary to devise a model
  that can detect DDoS attacks and serve the legitimate users with available resources
  with minimal downtime. This research paper addresses this need by investigating
  the multivariate correlation among the selected and ranked features. This study
  presents the promising performance results of our proposed comprehensive hybrid
  solution model using DBSCAN and Entropy, discusses the research findings, and visualizes
  the experimental results to show the degree of parametrical dependency among the
  selected features and the effectiveness of our multivariate correlational approach.

ABS: Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are increasingly deployed for their efficient
  content delivery and are often integrated with Software Defined Networks (SDNs)
  to achieve centrality and programmability of the network. However, these networks
  are also an attractive target for network attackers whose main goal is to exhaust
  network resources. One attack approach is to over-flood the OpenFlow switch tables
  containing routing information. Due to the increasing number of different flooding
  attacks such as DDoS, it becomes difficult to distinguish these attacks from normal
  traffic when evaluated with traditional attack detection methods. This paper proposes
  an architectural method that classifies and defends all possible forms of DDoS attack
  and legitimate Flash Crowd traffic using a segregated dimension functioning cognitive
  process based in a controller module. Our results illustrate that the proposed model
  yields significantly enhanced performance with minimal false positives and false
  negatives when classified with optimal Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression
  algorithms. The traffic classifications initiate deployment of security rules to
  the OpenFlow switches, preventing new forms of flooding attacks. To the best of
  our knowledge, this is the first work conducted on SDN-driven CDNi used to detect
  and defend against all possible DDoS attacks through traffic segregated dimension
  functioning coupled with cognitive classification.

ABS: When defending DDoS and other types of network attack, most products or service
  providers perform the protection by dropping the attack traffics. It cures the symptoms
  but not the disease. To help eliminate network attack, a more proactive approach
  is to trace back the attack source and stop the attack before it starts. Collecting
  the attack data is essential in attack trace-back. In this paper, we propose a live
  capture device to record the attack efficiently without disturbing the original
  network performance. The device is also integrated with anti-DDoS technique so that
  forensic data collection when be performed even under DDoS attacks. We made use
  of a network bridge and utilized packet capturing functionality provided by Linux,
  plus our packet storing mechanisms to build the forensic aware data collection device.
  The anti-DDoS protection uses machine learning to extract features of attacks, and
  then use a customized Bloom filter to defend attacks based on selected features.

ABS: Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks pose a severe threat to extensively
  used web-based services and applications. Many detection approaches have been proposed
  in the literature, but ensuring the security and availability of data, resources,
  and services to end users remains an ongoing research challenge. Nowadays, the traffic
  volume of legitimate users has also increased manifold. A flash event (FE) is a
  high-rate legitimate traffic situation wherein millions of legitimate users start
  accessing a particular network resource, such as a web server, simultaneously. The
  detection of DDoS attacks becomes more challenging when DDoS attacks are launched
  during behaviorally similar FEs. This research paper proposes a generalized detection
  system for metrics, based on information theory, capable of detecting different
  types of DDoS attacks and FEs. We used publically available MIT Lincoln, CAIDA,
  and FIFA datasets along with a synthetically generated DDoSTB dataset to validate
  the proposed detection algorithm in terms of various detection system evaluation
  metrics such as false positive rate, false negative rate, classification rate, and
  detection accuracy. Such a generalized detection system would be useful to researchers
  for validating and comparing various information theory metrics based solutions.

ABS: TCP SYN Flood is one of the most dangerous types of DDoS attacks. To perform
  the attack effectively, attackers attempt to send overwhelmed SYN packets with spoofed
  source, especially, information fields of each packet is spoofed as normal packet.
  Then it is very difficult to distinguish spoofed packets if we observe individual
  packet. In the previous study, we proposed method PIDAD (Packet Identification Anomaly
  Detection) to detect spoofed packets. However, this method has some limitations
  which is in need of further research and completion. In this study, we propose another
  method using multiple layers of Bloom Filter to address the limitations of previous
  our propose.

ABS: IP source spoofing is a consequence of lack of packet level authentication in
  the Internet which allows attackers to carry out Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed
  Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Source address validation filtering is one of
  the most important scheme that is deployed in the Internet to deter such attacks
  by filtering the spoofed IP packets. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to
  study the deployment of source address validation-filtering by using some special
  path backscatter messages that are generated by the spoofed traffic. We use the
  long term absence of such messages from an Autonomous System (AS) to classify it
  as non-spoofer AS. We use Caidas backscatter dataset for our study. We provide the
  list of spoofer and non-spoofer ASes from the given dataset. We also provide detailed
  mathematical analysis for calculating the amount of time we need to wait before
  declaring an AS as a non-spoofer. Besides, we use the normal approximation of binomial
  distribution to calculate confidence interval for the proportion of ASes allowing
  spoofing and to test the hypothesis regarding the spoofing activity in the Internet.

GEOLOC: Punjab, IN
ABS: A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an austere menace to extensively
  used Internet-based services and applications. Despite the presence of enormous
  DDoS defense solutions, the in-time detection of DDoS attacks poses a stiff challenge
  to network security professionals. The problem turns further crucial when such attacks
  are amalgamated with behaviorally similar flash events (FEs) wherein a large number
  of legitimate users starts accessing a particular service concurrently leading to
  the denial of service. This paper proposes an anomaly based distributed defense
  system called D-FAC that not only detect different type of DDoS attacks with efficacy
  but also efficiently mitigate their impact. D-FAC computes the information distance
  between legitimate and anomalous network traffic flows using information theory-based
  0-Divergence metric to detect different types of DDoS attacks and efficiently discriminate
  them from FEs. D-FAC distribute the computational and storage complexity of computing
  0-Divergence detection metric to the nearest point of presence (PoP) routers. D-FAC
  has been validated in an emulation based DDoSTB testbed using real DDoS attack tools
  and traffic generators. The results clearly show that D-FAC has outperformed existing
  Entropy and divergence based DDoS defense systems on various detection metrics like
  detection accuracy, classification rate, FPR, precision and F-measure.

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack remains a major threat, even in the
  era of connected devices. Attackers often hide their identity, making defending
  or identifying and subsequently prosecuting them difficult. In this paper, we propose
  a novel high-precision single-packet IP traceback (HPSIPT) scheme that facilitates
  the trace back of each spoofed packet to its origin. Numerous IP trace back techniques
  for tracing attackers exist; however, they are limited either by the number of packets
  required or the storage and computational overheads incurred at the routers. By
  contrast, the proposed technique incurs negligible storage and computational overheads.
  Simulation results based on real-world Internet topologies (obtained from CAIDA)
  reveal that the proposed IP traceback scheme has a precision of 0.9751, accuracy
  of 0.9053, recall of 0.8580 and an F1 score of 0.9128 when tracing 130,000 attackers.
  The implementation of the proposed scheme requires less than 10 KB of storage in
  most routers, which is approximately 32 times less than that required by other state-of-the-art
  single-packet traceback techniques. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is compared
  with that of other single-packet traceback schemes in terms of computational time,
  storage, accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. Statistical tests are performed
  to support the statistical significance of the obtained results.

ABS: Computer networks play an important role in modern industrial environments, as
  many of their areas heavily depend on continued operation and availability of provided
  network services. However, the network itself faces many security challenges in
  the form of various massive attacks that prevent its usage and yearly cause huge
  financial losses. The most widespread examples of such devastating attacks are the
  Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS attacks (DDoS). This paper is focusing
  on the analysis of detection methods that eliminate attacks impact. The paper introduces
  challenges of the current network based intrusion detection systems (NIDS) from
  distinct perspectives. Its primary focus is on the general functionality of selected
  detection methods, their categorization and following proposal of some potential
  improvements. Considering the requirements on present and future NIDS, we emphasize
  the application of machine learning (ML). The paper analyzes the state of research
  of four particular ML techniques regarding their success in implementation as NIDS
  - Bayesian Networks (BN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks
  (ANN) and Self-organizing Maps (SOM). The analysis reveals various drawbacks and
  benefits of the individual methods. Its purpose lies in the discovery of current
  trends showing a direction of the future research, which may possibly lead to the
  overall design improvement of new methods. The output of our research summarizes
  trends in the form of trends list and their influence on our future research.

ABS: With an exponential increase in the data size and complexity of various docu-ments
  to be investigated, existing methods of network forensics are found notmuch efficient
  with respect to accuracy and detection ratio. The existing tech-niques for network
  forensic analysis exhibit inherent limitations while process-ing a huge volume,
  variety, and velocity of data. It makes network forensic atime-consuming and resource-consuming
  task. To balance time taken and out-put delivered, these existing techniques put
  a limit on the amount of data under analysis, which results in a polynomial time
  complexity of these solu-tions. So to mitigate these issues, in this paper, we propose
  an effective frame-work to overcome the limitation to handle large volume, variety,
  and velocity of data. An architectural setup that consists of MapReduce framework
  on topof Hadoop Distributed File System environment is proposed in this paper.The
  proposed framework demonstrates its capability to handle issues of storage and processing
  of big data using cloud computing. Also, in the proposed frame-work, supervised
  machine learning (random forest-based decision tree) algo-rithm has been implemented
  to demonstrate better sensitivity. To train and validate the model, online available
  data set from CAIDA is taken and univer-sity network traffic samples, with increasing
  size, has been taken for experi-ment.  Results  thus  obtained  confirm  the  superiority  of  the  proposed
  framework in network forensics, with an average accuracy of 99.34% (mali-cious and

ABS: Traffic measurement and monitoring is crucial for network applications, such
  as network security, network management and so on. One central problem is to detect
  super nodes, which have significant change of connection degree between consecutive
  measurement periods. Due to weakness in massive network traffic processing for the
  centralized algorithm and low detection accuracy, space efficiency for super node
  detection algorithm based on flow sampling, we propose Parallel sketch based super
  node detection with traceability (PSD). It constructs parallel sketch and estimates
  connection degree of nodes by probabilistic counting approach, so that super nodes
  are identified using connection degree change between consecutive measurement periods.
  Moreover, IP addresses of super nodes are reconstructed by simple computing to trace
  attacker or victims. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method
  outperforms the Compact spread estimator (CSE) and Data streaming and sampling (DSS)
  in terms of detection accuracy and storage utilization.

ABS: Darknet traffic analysis is a possible choice for observing global trends in
  security threats and analyzing the behavior of Internet attacks. We previously analyzed
  darknet traffic and evaluated the day to day stability. The investigation of traffic
  data identifies several anomalous events with drastic changes in instability mainly
  caused by distributed denial-of-service attacks, misconfigurations, scans, and backscatters.
  Our previous proposal is not adapted to detect small-scale events, where a small
  number of attackers send packets to the destination targets in a short duration.
  We analyze herein the cause of instabilities in transmission control protocol traffic
  at different timescales by investigating the number of senders to each destination
  port and the duration of the attack to classify the characteristics of diverse events.
  Some large-scale events can be detected from the instabilities in daily traffic,
  while some small-scale events can be detected from the instabilities of hourly traffic.

  must be dealt with. Nevertheless, current network forensics is still unable to fully
  monitor and analyze computer network traffic to gather the evidences of malicious
  attacks or intrusions. Although major companies and government agencies have introduced
  various types of high-speed IDS into their networks, smaller firms or private organizations
  are unable to do so because of the cost involved. The lightweight IDS proposed in
  this study can be a suitable solution as this system can be operated with a common
  PC and peripherals. This system also underwent a test bed experiment and proved
  its efficiency. Jpcap library was used to capture transport packets which were then
  classified using typical communications protocols. The packet headers were subjected
  to analysis and the results were stored in database for later applications.

ABS: Crowd events or flash crowds are meant to be a voluminous access to media or
  web assets due to a popular event. Even though the crowd event accesses are benign,
  the problem of distinguishing them from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
  is difficult by nature as both events look alike. In contrast to the rich literature
  about how to profile and detect DDoS attack, the problem of distinguishing the benign
  crowd events from DDoS attacks has not received much interest. In this work, we
  propose a new approach for profiling crowd events and segregating them from normal
  accesses. We use a first selection based on semi-supervised approach to segregate
  between normal events and crowd events using the number of requests. We use a density
  based clustering, namely, DBSCAN, to label patterns obtained from a time series.
  We then use a second more refined selection using the resulted clusters to classify
  the crowd events. To this end, we build a XGBoost classifier to detect crowd events
  with a high detection rate on the training dataset (99%). We present our initial
  results of crowd events fingerprinting using 8 days log data collected from a major
  Content Delivery Network (CDN) as a driving test. We further prove the validity
  of our approach by applying our models on unseen data, where abrupt changes in the
  number of accesses are detected. We show how our models can detect the crowd event
  with high accuracy. We believe that this approach can further be used in similar
  CDN to detect crowd events.

ABS: Cascading failures are a severe threat to inter-domain routing system, while
  little has been done to detect and report impacts. To address the problem, we analyze
  the process of cascading failure in the inter-domain routing system, and find that
  it is constructed by two stages as key nodes/links failure and related nodes/links
  cascading failure. The first stage is shorter as the onset time is seconds level,
  while the second stage is longer as the onset time is at least one hour. Then a
  two-phase detection method FD-SP mechanism is put forward, the first stage of which
  adopts real-time detection methods to identify the initial failure nodes and links
  and the second stage uses DF 2 -CFM model to predict the damage range of cascade
  failure before true propagation. To validate FD-SP, it is applied to security events
  containing cascading failures and the results of FD-SP are compared with the datasets
  collected from RIPE during security events. Using the number of Update messages
  received by nodes as the metric, the maximum relative error is 1.69 and the average
  one is 0.92. As our prediction is a little large than reality, the false negative
  rate of FD-SP is low.

ABS: Societal dependence on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) over the
  past two decades has brought with it an increased vulnerability to a large variety
  of cyber-attacks. One such attack is a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack
  which harnesses the power of a larger number of compromised and geographically distributed
  computers and other networked machines to attack information-providing services,
  often resulting in significant downtime and thereby causing a denial-of-service
  to legitimate clients. The size, frequency, and sophistication of such attacks have
  exponentially risen over the past decade. In order to develop a better understanding
  of these attacks and defense system against this ever-growing threat, it is essential
  to understand their modus operandi, latest trends and other most widely-used tactics.
  Consequently, the study of DDoS attacks and techniques to accurately and reliably
  detect and mitigate their impact is an important area of research. This chapter
  largely focuses on the current landscape of DDoS attack detection and defense mechanisms
  and provides detailed information about the latest modus operandi of various network

ABS: Over the last five years there has been an increase in the frequency and diversity
  of network attacks. This holds true, as more and more organizations admit compromises
  on a daily basis. Many misuse and anomaly based intrusion detection systems (IDSs)
  that rely on either signatures, supervised or statistical methods have been proposed
  in the literature, but their trustworthiness is debatable. Moreover, as this paper
  uncovers, the current IDSs are based on obsolete attack classes that do not reflect
  the current attack trends. For these reasons, this paper provides a comprehensive
  overview of unsupervised and hybrid methods for intrusion detection, discussing
  their potential in the domain. We also present and highlight the importance of feature
  engineering techniques that have been proposed for intrusion detection. Furthermore,
  we discuss that current IDSs should evolve from simple detection to correlation
  and attribution. We descant how IDS data could be used to reconstruct and correlate
  attacks to identify attackers, with the use of advanced data analytics techniques.
  Finally, we argue how the present IDS attack classes can be extended to match the
  modern attacks and propose three new classes regarding the outgoing network communication.

ABS: In this short paper, we take a first step towards empirically assessing Internet-wide
  malicious activities generated from and targeted towards Internet-scale business
  sectors (i.e., financial, health, education, etc.) and critical infrastructure (i.e.,
  utilities, manufacturing, government, etc.). Facilitated by an innovative and a
  collaborative large-scale effort, we have conducted discussions with numerous Internet
  entities to obtain rare and private information related to allocated IP blocks pertaining
  to the aforementioned sectors and critical infrastructure. To this end, we employ
  such information to attribute Internet-scale maliciousness to such sectors and realms,
  in an attempt to provide an in-depth analysis of the global cyber situational posture.
  We draw upon close to 16.8 TB of darknet data to infer probing activities (typically
  generated by malicious/infected hosts) and DDoS backscatter, from which we distill
  IP addresses of victims. By executing week-long measurements, we observed an alarming
  number of more than 11,000 probing machines and 300 DDoS attack victims hosted by
  critical sectors. We also generate rare insights related to the maliciousness of
  various business sectors, including financial, which typically do not report their
  hosted and targeted illicit activities for reputation-preservation purposes. While
  we treat the obtained results with strict confidence due to obvious sensitivity
  reasons, we postulate that such generated cyber threat intelligence could be shared
  with sector/critical infrastructure operators, backbone networks and Internet service
  providers to contribute to the overall threat remediation objective.

ABS: In this paper, the design of a platform for the generation of NIDS evaluation
  datasets is proposed. The increasing sophistication of network attacks requires
  high volumes of high quality and realistic test data that can faithfully represent
  todays security threats to information systems. Our platform is based on the generation
  of aggregate traffic through the reproduction of real offline traffic and the injection
  of anomalous traffic. The use of free software tools in Linux environment is proposed.
  This solution provides an answer to the lack of datasets suitable for the study
  of Intrusion Detection Systems.

ABS: Vulnerable IoT devices are powerful platforms for building botnets that cause
  billion-dollar losses every year. In this work, we study Bashlite botnets and their
  successors, Mirai botnets. In particular, we focus on the evolution of the malware
  as well as changes in botnet operator behavior. We use monitoring logs from 47 honeypots
  collected over 11 months. Our results shed new light on those botnets, and complement
  previous findings by providing evidence that malware, botnet operators, and malicious
  activity are becoming more sophisticated. Compared to its predecessor, we find Mirai
  uses more resilient hosting and control infrastructures, and supports more effective
  attacks.

  on their applications in the realm of the behaviour-based Intrusion Detection Systems.
  Specificities of the Random Forest model are used to provide classification, feature

  general basic concepts related to Intrusion Detection Systems, including taxonomies,
  attacks, data collection, modelling, evaluation metrics, and commonly used methods.
  It also provides a survey of Random Forest based methods applied in this context,

  various attack-types and we investigate short and long term cycles within field

GEOLOC: Newcastle upon Tyne, UK
ABS: Todays computer networks are under increasing threat from malicious activity.
  Botnets (networks of remotely controlled computers, or bots) operate in such a way
  that their activity superficially resembles normal network traffic which makes their
  behavior hard to detect by current intrusion detection systems (IDS). Therefore,
  new monitoring techniques are needed to enable network operators to detect botnet
  activity quickly and in real time. Here, we show a sonification technique using
  the SoNSTAR system that maps characteristics of network traffic to a real-time soundscape
  enabling an operator to hear and detect botnet activity. A case study demonstrated
  how using traffic log files alongside the interactive SoNSTAR system enabled the
  identification of new traffic patterns characteristic of botnet behavior and subsequently
  the effective targeting and real-time detection of botnet activity by a human operator.
  An experiment using the 11.39 GiB ISOT botnet data set, containing labeled botnet
  traffic data, compared the SoNSTAR system with three leading machine learning-based
  traffic classifiers in a botnet activity detection test. SoNSTAR demonstrated greater
  accuracy (99.92%), precision (97.1%), and recall (99.5%) and much lower false positive
  rates (0.007%) than the other techniques. The knowledge generated about characteristic
  botnet behaviors could be used in the development of future IDSs.

ABS: In 2009 Google launched its Public DNS service, with its characteristic IP address
  8.8.8.8. Since then, this service has grown to be the largest and most well-known
  DNS service in existence. The popularity of public DNS services has been disruptive
  for Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). CDNs rely on IP information to geo-Locate
  clients. This no longer works in the presence of public resolvers, which led to
  the introduction of the EDNSO Client Subnet extension. ECS allows resolvers to reveal
  part of a clients IP address to authoritative name servers and helps CDNs pinpoint
  client origin. A useful side effect of ECS is that it can be used to study the workings
  of public DNS resolvers. In this paper, we leverage this side effect of ECS to study
  Google Public DNS. From a dataset of 3.7 billion DNS queries spanning 2.5 years,
  we extract ECS information and perform a longitudinal analysis of which clients
  are served from which Point-of-Presence. Our study focuses on two aspects of GPDNS.
  First, we show that while GPDNS has PoPs in many countries, traffic is frequently
  routed out of country, even if that was not necessary. Often this reduces performance,
  and perhaps more importantly, exposes DNS requests to state-level surveillance.
  Second, we study how GPDNS is used by clients. We show that end-users switch to
  GPDNS en masse when their ISPs DNS service is unresponsive, and do not switch back.
  We also find that many e-mail providers configure GPDNS as the resolver for their
  servers. This raises serious privacy concerns, as DNS queries from mail servers
  reveal information about hosts they exchange mail with. Because of GPDNSs use of
  ECS, this sensitive information is not only revealed to Google, but also to any
  operator of an authoritative name server that receives ECS-enabled queries from
  GPDNS during the lookup process.

GEOLOC: Honolulu, HI, US
ABS: Traffic measurement in high-speed networks has many applications in improving
  network performance, assisting resource allocation, and detecting anomalies. In
  this paper, we study a new problem called k-persistent spread estimation, which
  measures persist traffic elements in each flow that appear during at least k out
  of t measurement periods, where k and t can be arbitrarily defined in user queries.
  Solutions to this problem have interesting applications in network attack detection,
  popular content identification, user access profiling, etc. Yet, it is under-investigated
  as the prior work only addresses a special case with a questionable assumption.
  Designing an efficient and accurate k -persistent estimator requires us to use bitwise
  SUM (instead of bitwise AND typical in the prior art) to join the information collected
  from different periods. This seemly simple change has fundamental impact on the
  mathematical process in deriving an estimator, particular over space-saving virtual
  bitmaps. Based on real network traces, we show that our new estimator can accurately
  estimate the k -persistent spreads of the flows. It also performs much better than
  the existing work on the special case of measuring elements that appear in all periods.

GEOLOC: Hong Kong, CN
ABS: A new class of target link flooding attacks (LFAs) can cut off the Internet connections
  of a target area without being detected, because they employ legitimate flows to
  congest selected links. Although new mechanisms for defending against LFA have been
  proposed, the deployment issues limit their usage, since they require either additional
  modules to enhance routers or using the software-defined network to replace the
  traditional routers. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that employs both
  the end-to-end and hop-by-hop network measurement techniques to capture the abnormal
  path performance degradation for detecting LFA and then locate the target links
  or areas whenever possible, and develop a prototype of the framework named LinkScope.
  Although using network measurement to capture network anomaly is not new, we tackle
  a number of challenging issues, such as conducting large-scale Internet path monitoring
  via non-cooperative measurement so that users do not need to install LinkScope on
  every host, profiling the performance of asymmetric Internet paths and detecting
  LFA. The extensive evaluation in a testbed and the Internet shows that with limited
  bandwidth and computational overhead, LinkScope can achieve timely detection and
  diagnosis of LFA with high detection rate and low false positive rate.

ABS: Software-defined networking (SDN) is a novel and promising network architecture,
  which decouples the controlling function from the forwarding plane. SDN provides
  the flexibility to program the network through centralized control. However, security
  issues of SDN should arouse our attention. In this paper, we mainly discuss a specific
  vulnerability of the centralized control mechanism in SDN, which is likely to suffer
  denial-of-service (DoS) flooding attack. We propose a popularity and timeout analysis-based
  controller protection approach to protect the controller from the flooding attack.
  We develop a controller protection application on the SDN controller in which a
  popularity table is maintained. When the arriving rate of the packets to the controller
  exceeds the pre-defined threshold, the selected proactive flow table entries will
  be installed on the data plane switches to ensure that the requests to the most
  popular destination addresses can be served with higher priority. Furthermore, we
  mitigate the unpopular requests to a low priority queue, which can send Packet_In
  requests to the controller with rate limiting. The timeout analysis module in the
  application can identify the malicious host by analyzing the lifetime of the flows
  according to the flow-removed messages. Blocking entries will be added to the blacklist
  table on the switch. Our controller protection approach can effectively alleviate
  the impact of the SDN controller-oriented flooding attack. The detection rate is
  99.90%, and the false alarm rate is 0.41%.

  and sliding windows, which are faster than previous work. Our solutions are formally
  analyzed and are extensively evaluated over multiple real-world packet traces as
  well as synthetic ones. For streams, we demonstrate a run-time improvement of up
  to 2.4X compared to the state of the art. On sliding windows, we exhibit a memory
  reduction of over 100X on all traces and an asymptotic runtime improvement to a
  constant. Finally, we apply our approach to hierarchical heavy hitters and achieve
  an empirical 2.4-7X speedup.

ABS: Detection of super nodes is the task of determining hosts which contact with

  two continuous time windows. This is a basic problem with many practical applications,
  for example, traffic measurement and anomaly detection. The main challenge is to
  detect super nodes in real time in the constraint of limited memory. To solve the
  problem, we propose a novel solution to detect super nodes based on parallel sketch
  using connection metrics (connection number and connection change), called PSketch.
  It constructs a novel data structure, and combines connection number and connection
  change, so that the accuracy and time efficiency of our algorithm is improved obviously.
  The experimental results illustrate that our algorithm is superior to CSE (Compact
  Spread Estimator) and JDS (Joint Data Streaming and Sampling) in terms of accuracy,

ABS: This paper addresses the fundamental problem of finding persistent items and
  estimating the number of times each persistent item occurred in a given data stream
  during a given period of time at any given observation point. We propose a novel
  scheme, PIE, that can not only accurately identify each persistent item with a probability
  greater than any desired false negative rate (FNR), but can also accurately estimate
  the number of occurrences of each persistent item. The key idea of PIE is that it
  uses Raptor codes to encode the ID of each item that appears at the observation
  point during a measurement period and stores only a few bits of the encoded ID in
  the memory. The item that is persistent occurs in enough measurement periods that
  enough encoded bits for the ID can be retrieved from the observation point to decode
  them correctly and get the ID of the persistent item. To estimate the number of
  occurrences of any given persistent item, PIE uses maximum likelihood estimation-based
  statistical techniques on the information already recorded during the measurement
  periods. We implemented and evaluated PIE using three real network traffic traces
  and compared its performance with three prior schemes. Our results show that PIE
  not only achieves the desire FNR in every scenario, its average FNR can be 19.5
  times smaller than the FNR of the adapted prior scheme. Our results also show that
  PIE achieves any desired success probability in estimating the number of occurrences
  of persistent items.

ABS: IP anycast is a commonly used technique to share the load of a variety of global
  services. For more than one year, leveraging a lightweight technique for IP anycast
  detection, enumeration and geolocation, we perform regular IP monthly censuses.
  This paper provides a brief longitudinal study of the anycast ecosystem, and we
  additionally make all our datasets (raw measurements from PlanetLab and RIPE Atlas),
  results (monthly geolocated anycast replicas for all IP/24) and code available to
  the community.

ABS: Existing methods for active topology discovery within the IPv6 Internet largely
  mirror those of IPv4. In light of the large and sparsely populated address space,
  in conjunction with aggressive ICMPv6 rate limiting by routers, this work develops
  a different approach to Internet-wide IPv6 topology mapping. We adopt randomized
  probing techniques in order to distribute probing load, minimize the effects of
  rate limiting, and probe at higher rates. Second, we extensively analyze the efficiency
  and efficacy of various IPv6 hitlists and target generation methods when used for
  topology discovery, and synthesize new target lists based on our empirical results
  to provide both breadth (coverage across networks) and depth (to find potential
  subnetting). Employing our probing strategy, we discover more than 1.3M IPv6 router
  interface addresses from a single vantage point. Finally, we share our prober implementation,
  synthesized target lists, and discovered IPv6 topology results.

ABS: We present DIP, a deep learning based framework to learn structural properties
  of the Internet, such as node clustering or distance between nodes. Existing embedding-based
  approaches use linear algorithms on a single source of data, such as latency or
  hop count information, to approximate the position of a node in the Internet. In
  contrast, DIP computes low-dimensional representations of nodes that preserve structural
  properties and non-linear relationships across multiple, heterogeneous sources of
  structural information, such as IP, routing, and distance information. Using a large
  real-world data set, we show that DIP learns representations that preserve the real-world
  clustering of the associated nodes and predicts distance between them more than
  30% better than a mean-based approach. Furthermore, DIP accurately imputes hop count
  distance to unknown hosts (i.e., not used in training) given only their IP addresses
  and routable prefixes. Our framework is extensible to new data sources and applicable
  to a wide range of problems in network monitoring and security.

ABS: Computing and updating distributed shortest paths is a core functionality of
  todays communication networks. The solutions known in the literature are classified
  into two categories, namely Distance-Vector and Link-State algorithms. Distance-Vector
  algorithms usually require each node of the network to store the distance toward
  every other node in a data structure called routing table, thus requiring linear
  storage per node. Such a data structure is used to compute the next hop to be used
  to forward data toward any destination node of interest. This is usually done by
  solving very simple equations, thus requiring few computational time per node. The
  main drawback of Distance-Vector algorithms is that, in dynamic scenarios, they
  can suffer of the looping and count-to-infinity phenomena, though quite efficient
  countermeasures for such issues are known. Link-State algorithms, instead, require
  a node of the network to know and store the entire network topology, to compute
  its distance and next hop toward any destination. This is usually done by means
  of a centralized shortest-path algorithm, hence requiring quadratic storage and
  rather high computational effort per node. The main drawback of Link-State algorithms
  is that, notwithstanding they do not incur in looping and count-to-infinity problems,
  they perform quite poorly in dynamic scenarios, since nodes need to receive and
  store up-to-date information on the entire network topology after each change. In
  the last years, there has been a renewed interest in devising new light-weight distributed
  shortest-path solutions for large-scale Ethernet networks, where Distance-Vector
  algorithms are an attractive alternative to Link-State solutions when scalability
  and reliability are key issues or when the memory resources of the nodes of the
  network are limited. In this chapter, we hence focus on Distance-Vector solutions
  by reviewing classic approaches and recent algorithmic developments in this category.

  Although many future Internet architectures and protocols have been proposed to

  sound. In this paper, we take an economic perspective and seek to answer: Why most
  new Internet architectures failed to be deployed? What makes a new architecture
  easier to deploy? We develop a game-theoretic model to characterize the outcome
  of an architectures deployment through the equilibrium of ISPs decisions. We also
  use our model to explain the deploying outcomes of IPv6, DiffServ, CDN, etc., and
  the Internet flattening phenomenon. Furthermore, one can use our model to predict
  the deployability of new architectures such as NDN, XIA, and compare the deployability
  of competing architectures. Our study also suggests that the architectures which
  try to make a fresh start may have a low deployability, unless they have efficient
  incremental deployment mechanisms or one introduces a centralized coordinator to
  help the deployment.'

ABS: DNS backscatter detects internet-wide activity by looking for common reverse
  DNS lookups at authoritative DNS servers that are high in the DNS hierarchy. Both
  DNS backscatter and monitoring unused address space (darknets or network telescopes)
  can detect scanning in IPv4, but with IPv6s vastly larger address space, darknets
  become much less effective. This paper shows how to adapt DNS backscatter to IPv6.
  IPv6 requires new classification rules, but these reveal large network services,
  from cloud providers and CDNs to specific services such as NTP and mail. DNS backscatter
  also identifies router interfaces suggesting traceroute-based topology studies.
  We identify 16 scanners per week from DNS backscatter using observations from the
  B-root DNS server, with confirmation from backbone traffic observations or blacklists.
  After eliminating benign services, we classify another 95 originators in DNS backscatter
  as potential abuse. Our work also confirms that IPv6 appears to be less carefully
  monitored than IPv4.

ABS: The emergence of Internet topology research a couple of decades ago has fuelled
  the appearance of a whole discipline, seeking to find fundamental statistical laws,
  based upon the deployment of measurement platforms that intent to gather evidence
  for such studies. Notably, CAIDA Ark and RIPE Atlas have been collecting variants
  of traceroute outputs for decades, leading to a consistent body of knowledge on
  the field. Nevertheless, it is well known that general repositories are not sufficient
  to assess specific research aspects, for example, trying to explore some geographic
  region. It is recommended to run particular campaigns, to reveal aspects usually
  hindered by extensive explorations; determining probes and hit lists is a problem
  of paramount importance in such endeavors. In the present work, we target IPv6 topology
  characteristics in Latin America, and consequently, we run our specific campaign
  over the RIPE Atlas platform. We study the IPv6 Latin America characteristics using
  such platform for exploration, and compare it with a Latin America subset of CAIDA
  results. It is shown that the statistical properties are maintained while notable
  improvement in the number of links is revealed in comparison to the Latin America
  CAIDA subset, despite the lesser size of our campaign. We also perform an inter-country
  latency analysis, seeking to further characterize IPv6 interconnection in Latin
  America, unyielding that some groups of countries remain better interconnected as
  also occurs in the IPv4 case.

  attacking border routers and the resulting effects on global Internet connectivity
  at the autonomous-system level. For this, we simulate several malware-propagation
  strategies that disable border routers of leading manufacturers, and study their
  impact on a graph model of the Internet topology. Moreover, we also investigate
  the effect of attacks that simultaneously remove all routers of a particular vendor
  from the network. Our results show that targeted attacks on border routers would
  be extremely efficient and harmful to the global Internet connectivity.

ABS: IP spoofing is sending Internet Protocol (IP) packets with a forged source IP
  address to conceal the identity of the sender. A Denial Of-Service attack is an
  attempt to make a machine unavailable to the intended users. This attack employs
  IP Spoofing to flood the victim with overwhelming traffic, thus bringing it down.
  To prevent such attacks, it is essential to find out the real source of these attacks.
  IP Traceback is a technique for reliably determining the true origin of a packet.
  To traceback, a marking and a traceback algorithm are proposed here which use logarithmic
  and exponentiation respectively. The time required for marking and traceback has
  been evaluated and compared with state-of-art techniques. The percentage of increase
  in marking information is found to be very less in the proposed system. It is also
  demonstrated that the proposed system does not require logging at any of the intermediate
  routers thus leading to zero logging and storage overhead. The system also provides
  100% traceback accuracy.

ABS: 'Network tomography using end-to-end probes provides a powerful tool for monitoring
  the performance of internal network elements. However, active probing can generate
  tremendous traffic, which degrades the overall network performance. Meanwhile, not
  all the probing paths contain useful information for identifying the link metrics
  of interest. This observation motivates us to study the optimal selection of monitoring
  paths to balance identifiability and probing cost. Assuming additive link metrics
  (e.g., delays), we consider four closely-related optimization problems: 1) Max-ILCost
  that maximizes the number of identifiable links under a probing budget, 2) Max-Rank-Cost
  that maximizes the rank of selected paths under a probing budget, 3) Min-Cost-IL
  that minimizes the probing cost while preserving identifiability, and 4) Min-Cost-Rank
  that minimizes the probing cost while preserving rank. While (1) and (3) are hard
  to solve, (2) and (4) are easy to solve, and the solutions give a good approximation
  for (1) and (3). Specifically, we provide an optimal algorithm for (4) and a (1?1/e)-approximation
  algorithm for (2). We prove that the solution for (4) provides tight upper/lower
  bounds on the minimum cost of (3), and the solution for (2) provides upper/lower
  bounds on the maximum identifiability of (1). Our evaluations on real topologies
  show that solutions to the rank-based optimization (2, 4) have superior performance
  in terms of the objectives of the identifiability-based optimization (1, 3), and
  our solutions can reduce the total probing cost by an order of magnitude while achieving
  the same monitoring performance.'

ABS: Information broadcast (IB) is a critical process in complex network, usually
  accomplished by flooding mechanism. Although flooding is simple and no prior topological
  information is required, it consumes a lot of transmission overhead. Another extreme
  is the tree-based broadcast (TB), for which information is disseminated via a spanning
  tree. It achieves the minimal transmission overhead but the maintenance of spanning
  tree for every node is an obvious obstacle for implementation. Motivated by the
  success of scale-free network models for real-world networks, in this paper, we
  investigate the issues in IB by considering an alternative solution in-between these
  two extremes. A novel relay-based broadcast (RB) mechanism is proposed by employing
  a subset of nodes as relays. Information is firstly forwarded to one of these relays
  and then re-disseminated to others through the spanning tree whose root is the relay.
  This mechanism provides a trade-off solution between flooding and TB. On one hand,
  it saves up a lot of transmission overhead as compared to flooding; on the other
  hand, it costs much less resource for maintenance than TB as only a few spanning
  trees are needed. Based on two major criteria, namely the transmission overhead
  and the convergence time, the effectiveness of RB is confirmed. The impacts of relay
  assignment and network structures on performance are also studied in this work.

ABS: The security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has been recently receiving significant
  attention from the research community. While the majority of such attention originates
  from the control theory domain, few approaches have addressed the problem from the
  practical perspective. In this work, we do not claim that we propose a particular
  solution to a specific problem related to CPS security, but rather present a first
  look into what can help shape these solutions in the future. Indeed, our vision
  and ultimate goal is to attempt to merge or at least diminish the gap between highly
  theoretical solutions and practical approaches derived from insightful empirical
  experimentation , for securing CPS. Motivated by the scarcity of malicious empirical
  data that can be captured, inferred and analyzed from within operational CPS settings,
  this paper adopts a unique approach to derive notions of CPS maliciousness based
  on passive measurements and analysis. Indeed, by scrutinizing unsolicited real traffic
  targeting routable, allocated but unused Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (i.e.,
  darknet traffic), we shed the light on attackers intentions and actual attacks targeting
  ample of CPS communication and control protocols. To permit such analysis, we initially
  devise and evaluate a novel probabilis-tic model that aims at filtering noise (i.e.,
  misconfiguration traffic) that is embedded in darknet traffic. Subsequently, a near
  real-time inference algorithm is designed and implemented to detect CPS probing
  and denial of service activities. To this end, we characterize such misdemeanors
  in terms of their types, their frequency, their target protocols and possible orchestration
  behavior. The outcome demonstrate a staggering 16 thousand scanning 1 attempts and
  close to 8 thousand denial of service attacks on various CPS protocols. Further,
  the results uncover stealthy probing activities targeting proprietary CPS protocols
  and clusters of coordinated unsolicited activities. We concur that the devised approaches,
  techniques, and methods provide a solid first step towards better comprehending
  real CPS unsolicited objectives and intents. As such, we hope that this paper motivates
  the literature to design secure and tailored CPS models that leverage tangible attacks
  and vulnerabilities inferred from empirical measurements, to achieve truly reliable
  and secure CPS.

ABS: Advancements in computing, communication, and sensing technologies are making
  it possible to embed, control, and gather vital information from tiny devices that

  From smart home appliances to municipal water and electric industrial facilities
  to our everyday work environments, the next Internet frontier, dubbed IoT, is promising
  to revolutionize our lives and tackle some of our nations most pressing challenges.
  While the seamless interconnection of IoT devices with the physical realm is envisioned
  to bring a plethora of critical improvements in many aspects and diverse domains,
  it will undoubtedly pave the way for attackers that will target and exploit such
  devices, threatening the integrity of their data and the reliability of critical
  infrastructure. Further, such compromised devices will undeniably be leveraged as
  the next generation of botnets, given their increased processing capabilities and
  abundant bandwidth. While several demonstrations exist in the literature describing
  the exploitation procedures of a number of IoT devices, the up-to-date inference,
  characterization, and analysis of unsolicited IoT devices that are currently deployed
  in the wild is still in its infancy. In this article, we address this imperative
  task by leveraging active and passive measurements to report on unsolicited Internet-scale
  IoT devices. This work describes a first step toward exploring the utilization of
  passive measurements in combination with the results of active measurements to shed
  light on the Internet-scale insecurities of the IoT paradigm. By correlating results
  of Internet-wide scanning with Internet background radiation traffic, we disclose
  close to 14,000 compromised IoT devices in diverse sectors, including critical infrastructure
  and smart home appliances. To this end, we also analyze their generated traffic
  to create effective mitigation signatures that could be deployed in local IoT realms.
  To support large scale empirical data analytics in the context of IoT, we make available
  the inferred and extracted IoT malicious raw data through an authenticated front-end
  service. The outcomes of this work confirm the existence of such compromised devices
  on an Internet scale, while the generated inferences and insights are postulated
  to be employed for inferring other similarly compromised IoT devices, in addition
  to contributing to IoT cyber security situational awareness.

  telescope data to infer and analyze malicious activities generated by compromised
  IoT devices deployed in various domains. Explicitly, we develop a data-driven approach
  to pinpoint exploited IoT devices, investigate and differentiate their illicit actions,
  and examine their hosting environments. More importantly, we conduct discussions
  with various entities to obtain IP allocation information, which further allows
  us to attribute IoT exploitations per business sector (i.e., education, financial,
  manufacturing, etc.). Our analysis draws upon 1.2 TB of darknet data that was collected
  from a /8 network telescope for a 1 day period. The outcome signifies an alarming
  number of compromised IoT devices. Notably, around 940 of them fell victims of DDoS
  attacks, while 55,000 IoT nodes were shown to be compromised, aggressively probing
  Internet-wide hosts. Additionally, we inferred alarming IoT exploitations in various
  critical sectors such as the manufacturing, financial and healthcare realms.

ABS: Cyber space continues to be threatened by various debilitating attacks. In this
  context, executing passive measurements by analyzing Internet-scale, one- way darknet
  traffic has proven to be an effective approach to shed the light on Internet-wide
  maliciousness. While typically such measurements are solely conducted from the empirical
  perspective on already deployed darknet IP spaces using off-the-shelf Intrusion
  Detection Systems (IDS), their multidimensional theoretical foundations, relations
  and implications continue to be obscured. In this paper, we take a first step towards
  comprehending the relation between attackers behaviors, the width of the darknet
  vantage points, the probability of detection and the minimum detection time. We
  perform stochastic modeling, derivation, validation, inter-correlation and analysis
  of such parameters to provide numerous insightful inferences, such as the most effective
  IDS and the most suitable darknet IP space, given various attackers activities in
  the presence of detection time/probability constraints. One of the outcomes suggests
  that the widely-deployed Bro IDS is ideal for inferring slow, stealthy probing activities
  by leveraging passive measurements. Further, the results do not recommend deploying
  the Snort IDS when the available darknet IP space is relatively small, which is
  a typical scenario when darknets are operated and employed on organizational sub-networks.
  We concur that the generated derivations and mathematical relations put forward
  a first-of-akind formal and an accurate characterization of darknet-centric notions,
  which possess significant implications on Internet and passive measurements. This
  is especially factual with the advent of evolving paradigms such as IPv6 deployments
  and the proliferation of highly-distributed, orchestrated, large-scale and stealthy

  global Internet communication. In this study, we investigate the geographical characteristics
  of the visible Internet as well as examine the relation between geography and intra-AS
  and inter-AS routing policies. We show that the ingress-to-egress subpaths have
  lower circuitousness compared to the end-to-end paths. Our findings not only demonstrate
  the efficient backbone infrastructures and routing schemes deployed by ASes but
  also show the consequences of economical incentives on the adoption of inter-AS
  paths. We present and examine the existence of a strong correlation between the
  geographical distance and round trip delay time as well as the lack of a correlation
  between the geographical distance and hop length in the Internet. We investigate
  the relation between the geographical distance and intra-AS routing policies by
  employing cross-AS (X-AS) Internet topology maps. Our results show that more than
  two thirds of the intra-AS subpaths are congruent with the shortest geographical
  distance whether or not geographical distance is employed as a custom parameter
  in routing decisions. Our results provide new insights into the relations between
  geography and Internet routing, which allow the network researchers and practitioners
  to improve their networking infrastructures, reevaluate their routing policies,
  deploy geography-aware network overlays, and develop more realistic network simulation
  processes.

ABS: Domain names are at the base of todays cyber-attacks. Attackers abuse the domain
  name system (DNS) to mystify their attack ecosystems; they systematically generate
  a huge volume of distinct domain names to make it infeasible for blacklisting approaches
  to keep up with newly generated malicious domain names. To solve this problem, we
  propose DomainProfiler for discovering malicious domain names that are likely to
  be abused in future. The key idea with our system is to exploit temporal variation
  patterns (TVPs) of domain names. The TVPs of domain names include information about
  how and when a domain name has been listed in legitimate/popular and/or malicious
  domain name lists. On the basis of this idea, our system actively collects historical
  DNS logs, analyzes their TVPs, and predicts whether a given domain name will be
  used for malicious purposes. Our evaluation revealed that DomainProfiler can predict
  malicious domain names 220 days beforehand with a true positive rate of 0.985. Moreover,
  we verified the effectiveness of our system in terms of the benefits from our TVPs
  and defense against cyber-attacks.

ABS: Understanding the nature and characteristics of Internet events such as route
  changes and outages can serve as the starting point for improvements in network
  configurations, management and monitoring practices. However, the scale, diversity,
  and dynamics of network infrastructure makes event detection and analysis challenging.
  In this paper, we describe a new approach to Internet event measurement, identification
  and analysis that provides a broad and detailed perspective without the need for
  new or dedicated infrastructure or additional network traffic. Our approach is based
  on analyzing data that is readily available from Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers.
  NTP is one of the few on-by-default services on clients, thus NTP servers have a
  broad perspective on Internet behavior. We develop a tool for analyzing NTP traces
  called Tezzeract, which applies Robust Principal Components Analysis to detect Internet
  events. We demonstrate Tezzeracts efficacy by conducting controlled experiments
  and by applying it to data collected over a period of 3 months from 19 NTP servers.
  We also compare and contrast Tezzeracts perspective with reported outages and events
  identified through active probing. We find that while there is commonality across
  methods, NTP-based monitoring provides a unique perspective that complements prior
  methods.

  no longitudinal studies about web serving pattern dynamics have been performed.\n
  \nTo investigate the joint communication and computation patterns, we conducted
  a 1-year fine-grained measurement on world and China top 500 websites. Specifically,
  we examined path latency (perspective of communication) combined with hosting server
  dynamics (perspective of computation) from a longitudinal view of end user. Our
  result shows that persistent latency instability could exist with 2 contributors.
  One is persistent diurnal pattern, which exhibits significant daily latency discrepancy
  from 60 to 360 ms and can exist up to nearly 120 days out of 1 year. Another factor
  is dynamic server schedule. We design metrics and estimate to what extent server
  dynamics takes on over a long-term period and how it correlates with end-to-end
  latency. Further, we take a look at topological and geographical factors of server
  changes that affect path latency instability. The result shows that world and China

ABS: Achieving higher availability is an unending challenge in router architecture,
  as process technology scales down and more random logic/memory errors must be tolerated.
  However, meeting extremely high targets that require only few seconds of yearly
  downtime puts even more pressure on the design of already complex router architecture.
  In this paper, we explore the case of storing the routing table in non-volatile
  memory, to drastically reduce the router downtime and achieve higher availability
  - without degrading lookup performance. We propose a new MLC PCM architecture, featuring
  decoupled node access and logically managed duplicate bank groups, that fetches
  the right amount of information from the most available bank. Performance evaluation
  shows that we achieve an average of 9.9 percent bandwidth improvement over the DRAM
  baseline system, and an 83.9 percent over the PCM baseline.

ABS: Given a graph   G=(V,E) , the eccentricity of a vertex u is the distance from
  u to a vertex farthest from u. The set of vertices that minimizes the maximum distance
  to every other vertex (has minimum eccentricity) constitutes the center of the graph.
  The minimum eccentricity value represents the graphs radius. The eccentricity function
  of a graph can be unimodal or non-unimodal. A graph with unimodal eccentricity function
  has the property that the eccentricity of every vertex equals its distance to the
  center plus the radius. A graph with non-unimodal eccentricity function lacks this
  property. In this work, we characterize each type of eccentricity function and study
  the impact of each type on the intersection of shortest paths among distant vertex
  pairs with the center. A shortest path intersects the center if it includes at least
  one vertex that belongs to the center. In particular, we show that if the eccentricity
  function is unimodal, all shortest paths among distant vertex pairs intersect the
  graphs center. We also discuss when those paths do not intersect the center in graphs
  with non-unimodal eccentricity functions.

ABS: Software-based IP route lookup is one of the key components in Software Defined
  Networks. To address challenges on density, power and cost, Commodity CPU is preferred
  over other platforms to run lookup algorithms. As network functions become richer
  and more dynamic, route updates are more frequent. Unfortunately, previous works
  put less effort on fast incremental updates. On the other hand, The cache in CPU
  could be a performance limiter due to its small size, which requires algorithm designers
  to give high priority on storage efficiency in addition to time complexity. In this
  paper, we propose a new route lookup algorithm, OBMA, which improves update performance
  and storage efficiency while maintaining high lookup speed. The extensive experiments
  over real-word traces show that OBMA reduces the memory footprint to just 4.52 bytes/prefix,
  supports update speed up to 7.2 M/s which is 12.5 times faster than the state-of-the-art
  algorithm Poptrie. Besides, OBMA achieves up to 195.87 Mpps lookup speed with a
  single thread. Tests on comprehensive performance of lookup and update show that
  OBMA can sustain high lookup speed with update speed increasing.

ABS: Study of Content Distribution Networks(CDNs) attracts increasing attentions recently.
  Deploying a set of servers across the Internet containing replicated content will
  certainly provide users with better experience by reducing request latency and balancing
  the load. However, due to the large-scale and high-volume requests from the users,
  quantities of proxy servers are needed resulting in high cost of facilities. Therefore,
  it is necessary to find an optimal replicated-server placement that can improve
  Internet performance while controlling the budget. To solve this problem, we first
  propose a new model, C FLPEC, based on which the nature of Internet can be described.
  In addition, we analyze the feasibility and compare several lower bound algorithms
  of the new model. Based on C FLPEC, we testify the performance of the network-segmentation
  algorithm. The proposed algorithm uses K-means algorithm to cluster the network
  and for each cluster, greedy algorithm is applied to find out an approximate placement
  in this area. As we obtain the solutions for all the clusters respectively, we merge
  them to constitute the final solution for the whole network. Instead of directly
  stitching them together, possible situations that will occur on the boundaries between
  two clusters are also taken into consideration. Finally, we learn from the natural
  characteristics of the Internet to construct the simulation model, and simulation
  results illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

ABS: Recent studies have demonstrated that network community structure can significantly
  reduce the network transport efficiency. In this paper, the weakening community
  structure (WCS) strategy based on adding of edges that can effectively weaken the
  network community characteristics and improve the network transport efficiency is
  proposed. TheWCSperformance was validated by experiments, which were performed on
  pseudo-random network, scale-free artificial networks with community structures,
  and real internet, using the shortest path routing and the local routing. The experimental
  results have demonstrated that theWCSstrategy can greatly improve the network load
  capacity and reduce the average length of the shortest path by adding a small amount
  of edges between communities. The proposed mechanism not only provides the improvement
  of network transport efficiency but also can be adapted for restraining of malicious
  information propagation through the network.

ABS: The last decades have witnessed the progressive development of research on Internet
  topology at the router or autonomous systems (AS) level. Routers are essential components
  of ASes, which dominate their behaviors. It is important to identify the affiliation
  between routers and ASes because this contributes to a deeper understanding of the
  topology. However, the existing methods that assign a router to an AS, based on
  the origin AS of its IP addresses do not make full use of the information during
  the network interaction procedure. In this paper, we propose a novel method to assign
  routers to their owners AS, based on community discovery. First, we use the initial
  AS information along with router-pair similarities to construct a weighted router
  level graph; secondly, with the large amount of graph data (more than 2M nodes and
  19M edges) from the CAIDA ITDK project, we propose a fast hierarchy clustering algorithm
  with time and space complexity, which are both linear for graph community discovery.
  Finally, router-to-AS mapping is completed, based on these AS communities. Experimental
  results show that the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Combining
  with AS communities, our method could have the higher accuracy rate reaching to
  82.62% for Routers-to-AS mapping, while the best accuracy of prior works is plateaued
  at 65.44%.

ABS: Research has shown that distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on the Internet
  could often be better handled by enlisting the in-network defense of multiple autonomous
  systems (ASes), rather than relying entirely on the victims Internet Service Provider
  at the edge. Less noticed but important is the fact that an in-network defense can
  also remove DDoS traffic from the Internet early en route to the victim, thus decreasing
  the overall load on the Internet and reducing chances of link congestion. However,
  it is not well understood to what degree different in-network defense strategies
  can achieve such benefits. In this paper, we model the existing two main categories
  of in-network DDoS defense algorithms (PushBack, SourceEnd) and propose a new type
  of algorithm (StrategicPoints). In particular, we compare their effectiveness in
  minimizing the amount of DDoS traffic that the victim receives, their impact on
  reducing the DDoS traffic on the entire Internet, and their resiliency against intelligent
  adversaries and dynamic attacks. We detail how the comparison results vary according
  to parameters and provide our insights on the pros and cons of these three categories

ABS: Operating distributed Scrubbing Centers (SCs) to mitigate massive Distributed

  The operator needs to determine the diversion rule installation and elimination
  in the networks, as well as the scrubbing resource activation and revocation in
  the SCs, while minimizing the long-term cost and the cumulative decision-switching
  penalty without knowing the exact amount of the malicious traffic. We model and
  formulate this problem as an online nonlinear integer program. In contrast to many
  other online problems where future inputs are unknown but at least current inputs
  are known, a key new challenge here is that even part of the current inputs are
  unknown when decisions are made. To learn; the best decisions online, we transform
  our problem via a gap-preserving approximation into an online optimization problem
  with only the known inputs, which is further relaxed and decoupled into a series
  of one-shot convex programs solvable in individual time slots. To overcome the intractability,
  we design a progressive rounding algorithm to convert fractional decisions into
  integral ones without violating the constraints. We characterize the competitive
  ratio of our approach as a function of the key parameters of our problem. We conduct
  evaluations using real-world data and confirm our algorithms superiority over de

GEOLOC: Paris, FR
ABS: On the Internet, routers of Autonomous Systems (ASes) have to determine their
  preferred inter-domain route, i.e. control path (CP), for each IP prefix. The traffic
  is then forwarded AS after AS, following a data path (DP) that should match the
  CP for the same prefix. The underlying implicit trust that ASes advertise the paths
  they use for packet forwarding may be misplaced. Network operators may tweak CPs
  and DPs to carry out inter-domain lies that are visible when the two paths differ.
  Lies can be either unintended, due to misconfigurations or technical limitations,
  or deliberate, e.g. for economical gain. While lies globally mitigate the ability
  to troubleshoot and understand the root cause of connectivity issues, detecting
  them is not a trivial task as the ground data is noisy.In this paper, we propose
  a modular framework to measure and correctly quantify the discrepancies between
  CPs and DPs. We define several rules to overcome specific sources of noise inducing
  mismatches (MMs), e.g., incomplete traces, sibling ASes, IXPs or third-party addresses
  in general. We leverage the Peering testbed to conduct a measurement campaign at
  a scale never achieved before, and conclude that, while the upper bound of lies
  is significant, the lower bound is not negligible. This suggests that the noise

ABS: Betweenness centrality measures the centrality of nodes and edges in a graph
  based on the concept of shortest paths. However, such a definition is unsuitable
  for uncertain graphs due to the uncertainty of links. In the possible-world semantics,
  the Monte Carlo method is proposed to estimate the betweenness centrality of uncertain
  graphs. However, this method is computationally intensive. To address this challenging
  issue, in this paper, we propose the concept of possible shortest paths and develop
  a metric to approximate the betweenness centrality for uncertain graphs. We demonstrate
  that the new metric of betweenness centrality generalizes the deterministic one.
  Unfortunately, it is NP-hard to enumerate all possible shortest paths between two
  nodes exhaustively. To tackle this difficulty, we design a heuristic algorithm to
  explore the majority of possible shortest paths efficiently. Our method avoids the
  sampling process in the Monte Carlo method, and thus significantly improves the
  computational efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness
  and efficiency of our method. The experimental results show that our approach can
  approximate the centrality of uncertain graphs accurately with high efficiency.
  Finally, we apply our method to the Internet network to evaluate the importance
  of autonomous systems.

ABS: '-Large botnet-based flooding attacks have recently demonstrated unprecedented
  damage. However, the best-known end-to-end availability guarantees against flooding
  attacks require costly global-scale coordination among autonomous systems (ASes).
  A recent proposal called routing around congestion (or RAC) attempts to offer strong
  end-to-end availability to a selected critical flow by dynamically rerouting it
  to an uncongested detour path without requiring any inter-AS coordination. This
  paper presents an in-depth analysis of the (in)feasibility of the RAC defense and
  points out that its rerouting approach, though intriguing, cannot possibly solve
  the challenging flooding problem. An effective RAC solution should find an inter-domain
  detour path for its critical flow with the two following desired properties: (1)
  it guarantees the establishment of an arbitrary detour path of its choice, and (2)
  it isolates the established detour path from non-critical flows so that the path
  is used exclusively for its critical flow. However, we show a fundamental trade-off
  between the two desired properties, and as a result, only one of them can be achieved
  but not both. Worse yet, we show that failing to achieve either of the two properties
  makes the RAC defense not just ineffective but nearly unusable. When the newly established
  detour path is not isolated, a new adaptive adversary can detect it in real time
  and immediately congest the path, defeating the goals of the RAC defense. Conversely,
  when the establishment of an arbitrary detour path is not guaranteed, more than
  80% of critical flows we test have only a small number (e.g., three or less) of
  detour paths that can actually be established and disjoint from each other, which
  significantly restricts the available options for the reliable RAC operation. The
  first lesson of this study is that BGP-based rerouting solutions in the current
  inter-domain infrastructure seem to be impractical due to implicit assumptions (e.g.,
  the invisibility of poisoning messages) that are unattainable in BGPs current practice.
  Second, we learn that the analysis of protocol specifications alone is insufficient
  for the feasibility study of any new defense proposal and, thus, additional rigorous
  security analysis and various network evaluations, including real-world testing,
  are required. Finally, our findings in this paper agree well with the conclusion
  of the major literature about end-to-end guarantees; that is, strong end-to-end
  availability should be a security feature of the Internet routing by design, not
  an ad hoc feature obtained via exploiting current routing protocols.'

ABS: Interactive and multimedia applications depend on the stability of end-to-end
  paths for predictable performance and good quality of service. On the other hand,
  network providers depend on multiple paths to ensure fault tolerance and use load
  balancing between these paths to enhance the overall network throughput. In this
  study, we analyze path dynamics for both end-to-end paths and path segments within
  service providers networks using two months of measurement data from the RIPE Atlas
  platform, which collects path traces between a fixed set of source and destination
  pairs every 15 minutes. We observe that 78% of the end-to-end routes have at least
  two alternative Autonomous System (AS) paths with some end-to-end routes going through
  hundreds of different AS paths during the two months of analysis. While AS level
  paths are often prevalent for a day, there are considerable changes in the routing
  of the trace packets over the ASes for a longer duration of a month or longer. Analyzing
  end-to-end paths for routing anomalies, we observe that 4.4% of the path traces
  (involving 18% of the ASes) contain routing loops indicating mis-configuration of
  routers. Some of the ASes had over 100 routers involved in loops in path traces
  through their networks. We observe a much higher rate of anomalies in the AS level,
  with 45% of path traces containing an AS loop. Additionally, we discovered that
  few of the ASes bounce-back packets where some traces through their network traverse
  routers in both forward and backward directions. Determining path segments belonging
  to each AS, we further explore ingress to egress paths of ASes in addition to the
  source to destination paths within the AS. Analyzing trace segments between ingresses
  and egresses of an AS, we realized more than half of the ASes have the same router
  level path between any ingress-egress pair for the two months, but others implement
  load balancing. These results are different from earlier studies that indicated
  a high level of path dynamism. Our results indicate that the end-to-end path dynamism
  is due to the BGP level rather than the router level within ASes.

ABS: Internet topology reflects economic and political constraints that change over
  time. Although autonomous systems (AS) topology has been measured and modeled for
  many years, focusing primarily on economic relationships, earlier studies have not
  quantified how topology is changing with respect to nation-state boundaries. National
  boundaries are natural points of control for surveillance, censorship, tariffs and
  data localization. This paper introduces a measure, national choke-point potential
  (NCP), to characterize how a countrys AS topology is organized in terms of BGP paths
  that can carry traffic across international borders. To study country-level chokepoints,
  we developed BGP-SAS, an open source, cross platform, efficient set of tools for
  simulating BGP routing and calculating national chokepoint measures. We use these
  tools to assess how AS topologies have changed over a ten-year span, finding significant
  variability among countries, with some increasing their chokepoint potential and
  others remaining constant, fluctuating, and in some cases declining. Overall, however,
  most national Internet boundaries have either become more pronounced or remained
  constant, despite new infrastructure buildouts and increased Internet usage. When
  compared to independent measures of Internet freedom, we find statistically significant
  relationships between NCP and Internet freedom.

  answer the questions:Which methods are available for the representation and processing
  of the peering relations and make optimisation recommendations? What information
  and which information sources should be available as input for a tool to fulfill
  SURFnets requirements? Can these methods and tools also recommend peers for the
  best redundancy? With the help of concrete optimisation scenarios formulated by
  SURFnet, we characterise the problem and propose a constraint-based recommendation
  system to provide BGP optimisation recommendations. We outline the design and build
  a recommender prototype applied to the BGP peering optimisation domain, and we identify
  and collect the information required. Our results shows that the application of
  constraint-based recommendation systems to the BGP peering optimisation domain is
  viable, even while acknowledging the limitations of our public domain data.

ABS: Simulating the BGP routing system of Internet is crucial to the analysis of Internet
  backbone network routing behavior, locating network failure and, evaluating network
  performance for future Internet. However, the existing BGP routing model lacks in
  the coarse modeling granularity and the priori knowledge based model. The analysis
  of BGP routing data that reflects the routing behaviors, directly impacts the BGP
  routing decision and forward strategy. The efficiency of such analysis dictates
  the time it takes to come up with such a time-critical decision and strategy. Under
  the existing model, BGP routing data analysis does not scale up. In this paper,
  we analyze the inter-domain routing decision making process, then present a prefix
  level route decision prediction model. More specifically, we apply deep learning
  methods to build a high-precision BGP route decision process model. Our model handles
  as much available routing data as possible to promote the prediction accuracy. It
  analyzes the routing behaviors without any prior knowledge. Beyond discussing the
  characteristics of the model, we also evaluate the proposed model using experiments
  explained in detailed cases. For the research community, our method could help in
  detecting routing dynamics and route anomalies for routing behavior analysis.

ABS: 'BGP is the de-facto Internet routing protocol for exchanging prefix reachability
  information between Autonomous Systems (AS). It is a dynamic, distributed, path-vector
  protocol that enables rich expressions of network policies (typically treated as
  secrets). In this regime, where complexity is interwoven with information hiding,
  answering questions such as what is the expected catchment of the anycast sites
  of a content provider on the AS-level, if new sites are deployed?, or how will load-balancing
  behave if an ISP changes its routing policy for a prefix?, is a hard challenge.
  In this work, we present a formal model and methodology that takes into account
  policy-based routing and topological properties of the Internet graph, to predict
  the routing behavior of networks. We design algorithms that provide new capabilities
  for informative route inference (e.g., isolating the effect of randomness that is
  present in prior simulation-based approaches). We analyze the properties of these
  inference algorithms, and evaluate them using publicly available routing datasets
  and real-world experiments. The proposed framework can be useful in a number of
  applications: measurements, traffic engineering, network planning, Internet routing
  models, etc. As a use case, we study the problem of selecting a set of measurement
  vantage points to maximize route inference. Our methodology is general and can capture
  standard valley-free routing, as well as more complex topological and routing setups

ABS: As autonomous systems tend to forward packets along the path with minimal routing
  cost, Internet routes are unevenly distributed on physical links. Links which a
  large number of routes go through are called routing bottlenecks. Flooding such
  routing bottlenecks can degrade or even cut off the network connectivity in a large
  area, making them a serious vulnerability of the Internet. In this paper, we study
  the characteristics of inter-domain routing bottlenecks and point out that they
  can be further aggravated by manipulating BGP updates to launch prefix hijackings.
  We first simulate large quantities of AS-level routing paths to illustrate the pervasiveness
  of inter-domain routing bottlenecks, as well as their direction, topological location,
  distance and concentration. Then, we propose a method for measuring and aggravating
  inter-domain bottlenecks of some AS, such that link flooding on them can be effectively
  amplified in a stealthy way. Moreover, adversary can adjust the specific method
  according to its purpose of malicious behaviour. At last, we discuss how inter-domain
  routing bottlenecks may be affected as the Internet evolves, where we witness the
  new, or wider, deployment of some routing related mechanisms.

ABS: Multi-domain network resource reservation systems are being deployed, driven
  by the demand and substantial benefits of providing predictable network resources.
  However, a major lack of existing systems is their coarse granularity, due to the
  participating networks concern of revealing sensitive information, which can result
  in substantial inefficiencies. This paper presents Mercator, a novel multi-domain
  network resource discovery system to provide fine-grained, global network resource
  information, for collaborative sciences. The foundation of Mercator is a resource
  abstraction through algebraic-expression enumeration ( i.e. , linear inequalities/equations),
  as a compact representation of multiple properties of network resources ( e.g. ,
  bandwidth, delay, and loss rate) in multi-domain networks. In addition, we develop
  an obfuscating protocol, to address the privacy concerns by ensuring that no participant
  can associate the algebraic expressions with the corresponding member networks.
  We also introduce a super-set projection technique to increase Mercators scalability.
  We implement a prototype Mercator and deploy it in a small federation network. We
  also evaluate the performance of Mercator through extensive experiments using real
  topologies and traces. Results show that Mercator 1) efficiently discovers available
  networking resources in collaborative networks on average four orders of magnitude
  faster, and allows fairer allocations of network resources; 2) preserves the member
  networks privacy with little overhead; and 3) scales to a collaborative network
  of 200 member networks.

  for continuously mining frequent items in the multi-level, non-regular tree-based
  communication structure. Our method employs a combination of local tracking and
  delays updating at each node to produce highly communication-efficient and space-efficient
  solutions. To reduce the communication cost, it only sends the frequency increments
  to violate a pre-defined threshold through a hierarchy of intermediate nodes, which
  is interposed between the monitoring nodes and the root node. With the information
  gathered, the root node continuously reports the set of frequent items. Two optimization
  approaches are proposed to minimize the worst-case total communication and minimize
  the worst-case maximum load on any link under any input streams. We perform extensive
  simulations with real traffic traces to evaluate the performances of the two optimization
  approaches.

ABS: Network trace data provides valuable information which contributes to model network
  behavior, defends network attacks, and develops new network protocols. Therefore,
  releasing network trace data is highly demanded by researchers and organizations
  to promote development of network technologies. However, due to the sensitivity
  of the network track data, it is a potential risk for organizations to publish the
  original data which may expose their commercial confidentiality and customers privacy
  within their networks. Several methods have been proposed to prevent network track
  attacks, such as statistical fingerprinting and injection. Unfortunately, they are
  not sufficient to protect privacy because adversary can use more background knowledge
  to reach the intended attack, and this kind of attack is proved to be used. This
  paper proposed an attack model named MultiAttacks by using more background knowledge.
  For this attack model, it extracts the inherent graphics structure between the source
  and destination IP addresses in the network trace data and proposes a solution,
  data swapping, to prevent the target host from being recognized, which is based
  on k-anonymity. Combined with other protection techniques, our method can effectively
  prevent this Multi-Attacks model while preserving the data utility and providing
  formal guarantees of confidentiality protection. And using data swapping method
  for privacy protection can provide a more perfect solution, reach a higher level
  of privacy protection and guarantee good data utility related to the anonymity-based
  approach. Lastly, our proposed algorithm is applied to different real datasets and

ABS: In recent years, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks have escalated
  both in frequency and traffic volume, with outbreaks reaching rates up to the order
  of terabits per second and compromising the availability of supposedly highly resilient
  infrastructure (e.g., DNS and cloud-based web hosting). The reality is that existing
  detection solutions resort to a combination of mechanisms, such as packet sampling
  and transmission of gathered data to external software, which makes it very difficult
  (if at all possible) to reach a good compromise for accuracy (higher is better),
  resource usage footprint, and latency (lower is better). Data plane programmability
  has emerged as a promising approach to help meeting these requirements as forwarding
  devices can be configured to execute algorithms and examine traffic at line rate.
  In this paper, we explore P4 primitives to design a fine-grained, low-footprint,
  and low-latency traffic inspection mechanism for real-time DDoS attack detection.
  Our proposal - the first to be fully in-network - contributes to shed light on the
  challenges to implement sophisticated security logic on forwarding devices given
  that, to operate at high throughput, the inspection (and overall processing) of
  packets is subject to a small time budget (dozens of nanoseconds) and limited memory
  space (in the order of megabytes). We evaluate the proposed mechanism using packet
  traces from CAIDA. The results show that it can detect DDoS attacks entirely within
  the data plane with high accuracy (98.2%) and low latency (~250 ms) while keeping
  device resource usage low (dozens of kilobytes in SRAM per 1 Gbps link and a few
  hundred TCAM entries).

ABS: Software-defined networking decouples the control plane and data plane, which
  grants more computing power for routing computations. Traditional routing methods
  suffer from the complex dynamics in networking, and they are facing issues such
  as slow convergence and performance decline. Deep learning techniques have shown
  preliminary results on solving the routing problem, and bringing more accuracy,
  precision, and intelligence compared with traditional modeling techniques. However,
  the existing deep learning architectures are not built to learn from the crucial
  topological relations between forwarding nodes, which restricts the models ability
  to handle different network conditions. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
  based intelligent routing strategy with revised graph-aware neural networks, which
  learns topological information efficiently. In addition, a set of features suitable
  for network routing are designed so that the networking state are well represented
  upon each routing decision. In experiments, the performance of the proposed work
  is demonstrated with a real-world topology and the production level software switches.
  The execution time is evaluated on various kinds of network topology and different
  network scales. Also, the simulation result shows that the proposed work is more
  accurate and efficient compared to the state-of-the-art routing strategy.

ABS: 'Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are a major security threat against
  the availability of conventional or cloud computing resources. Numerous DDoS attacks,
  which have been launched against various organizations in the last decade, have
  had a direct impact on both vendors and users. Many researchers have attempted to
  tackle the security threat of DDoS attacks by combining classification algorithms
  with distributed computing. However, their solutions are static in terms of the
  classification algorithms used. In fact, current DDoS attacks have become so dynamic
  and sophisticated that they are able to pass the detection system thereby making
  it difficult for static solutions to detect. In this paper, we propose a dynamic
  DDoS attack detection system based on three main components: classification algorithms,
  a distributed system, and a fuzzy logic system. Our framework uses fuzzy logic to
  dynamically select an algorithm from a set of prepared classification algorithms
  that detect different DDoS patterns. Out of the many candidate classification algorithms,
  we use Naive Bayes, Decision Tree (Entropy), Decision Tree (Gini), and Random Forest
  as candidate algorithms. We have evaluated the performance of classification algorithms
  and their delays and validated the fuzzy logic system. We have also evaluated the
  effectiveness of the distributed system and its impact on the classification algorithms
  delay. The results show that there is a trade-off between the utilized classification
  algorithms accuracies and their delays. We observe that the fuzzy logic system can
  effectively select the right classification algorithm based on the traffic status.'

ABS: Pattern counting in graphs is fundamental to several network sci- ence tasks,
  and there is an abundance of scalable methods for estimating counts of small patterns,
  often called motifs, in large graphs. However, modern graph datasets now contain
  richer structure, and incorporating temporal information in particular has become
  a key part of network analysis. Consequently, temporal motifs, which are generalizations
  of small subgraph patterns that incorporate temporal ordering on edges, are an emerging
  part of the network analysis toolbox. However, there are no algorithms for fast
  estimation of temporal motifs counts; moreover, we show that even counting simple
  temporal star motifs is NP-complete. Thus, there is a need for fast and approximate
  algorithms. Here, we present the first frequency estimation algorithms for counting
  temporal motifs. More specifically, we develop a sampling framework that sits as
  a layer on top of existing exact counting algorithms and enables fast and accurate
  memory-efficient estimates of temporal motif counts. Our results show that we can
  achieve one to two orders of magnitude speedups over existing algorithms with minimal
  and controllable loss in accuracy on a number of datasets.

ABS: This paper explores the problem of flow metering in 100 GbE links, presenting
  a flow exporter architecture based on a FPGA acceleration card using only on-chip
  memory. Peak performance without packet sampling even at the maximum packet rate
  is assured and means to avoid data loss are provided, since a low level of aggregation
  is achieved. This is the first approach in a series of architectures that are built
  upon the previous one, where the resources of the custom hardware are gradually
  increased, improving the aggregation level, while the required commodity hardware
  resources for subsequent stages are consequently lowered. We consider that FPGA-fabric
  offers adequate flexibility and performance for this task and is capable of reducing
  overall system cost. A functional prototype of the system has been implemented on
  the Xilinx VCU118 development board configured to export TCP sessions records. This
  achievement represents a cornerstone of a 100 GbE FPGA flow exporter design, that
  aims for supporting in the order of tens of millions concurrent flows.

ABS: Fast detection of heavy flows (e.g., heavy hitters and heavy changers) in massive
  network traffic is challenging due to the stringent requirements of fast packet
  processing and limited resource availability. Invertible sketches are summary data
  structures that can recover heavy flows with small memory footprints and bounded
  errors, yet existing invertible sketches incur high memory access overhead that
  leads to performance degradation. We present MV-Sketch, a fast and compact invertible
  sketch that supports heavy flow detection with small and static memory allocation.
  MV-Sketch tracks candidate heavy flows inside the sketch data structure via the
  idea of majority voting, such that it incurs small memory access overhead in both
  update and query operations, while achieving high detection accuracy. We present
  theoretical analysis on the memory usage, performance, and accuracy of MV-Sketch.
  Trace-driven evaluation shows that MVSketch achieves higher accuracy than existing
  invertible sketches, with up to 3.38x throughput gain. We also show how to boost
  the performance of MV-Sketch with SIMD instructions.

ABS: Current Bloom Filters tend to ignore Bayesian priors as well as a great deal
  of useful information they hold, compromising the accuracy of their responses. Incorrect
  responses cause users to incur penalties that are both application- and item-specific,
  but current Bloom Filters are typically tuned only for static penalties. Such shortcomings
  are problematic for all Bloom Filter variants, but especially so for Time-decaying
  Bloom Filters, in which the memory of older items decays over time, causing both
  false positives and false negatives. We address these issues by introducing inferential
  filters, which integrate Bayesian priors and information latent in filters to make
  penalty-optimal, query-specific decisions. We also show how to properly infer insertion
  times in such filters. Our methods are general, but here we illustrate their application
  to inferential time-decaying filters to support novel query types and sliding window
  queries with dynamic error penalties. We present inferential versions of the Timing
  Bloom Filter and Generalized Bloom Filter. Our experiments on real and synthetic
  datasets show that our methods reduce penalties for incorrect responses to sliding-window
  queries in these filters by up to 70% when penalties are dynamic.

ABS: Graphics processing units are widely-used for packet processing acceleration
  in both physical and virtual networks. However, real-life packets come in highly-divergent
  sizes, causing severe GPU control flow divergence. Previous solutions rely on CPU
  preprocessing to reduce divergence, but it forbids the more efficient NIC-GPU packet
  streaming as packet batches have to stop completely at host machine. To fully utilize
  both GPU and PCIe resources, we propose Blink as a GPU modular software router.
  Instead of CPU pre-processing, the Blink router uses On-GPU Thread-Data Remapping
  to reduce divergence, and our novel Cross-Iteration Thread Event Signaling mechanism
  filters unnecessary inter-thread synchronization, doubling the performance gain
  achieved by traditional solution. Serving as a TCP/IP router with Deep Packet Inspection
  (DPI) firewall, Blink can sustain processing throughput of 31.5 GBit/s over a PCIe
  bandwidth of 32 GBit/s. Given a certain bandwidth, Blink reduces processing latency
  at least by half compared with other works.

ABS: Reliably tracking large network flows in order to determine so-called elephant
  flows, also known as heavy hitters or frequent items, is a common data mining task.
  Indeed, this kind of information is crucial in many different contexts and applications.
  Since storing all of the traffic is impossible, owing to the fact that flows arrive
  as an unbounded, infinite length stream, many different algorithms have been designed
  for traffic measurement using only a limited amount of memory. CountMax is a recently
  published algorithm that solves this problem approximately by combining ideas from
  the CountMin and MisraGries algorithms. In this paper we introduce CMSS which cleverly
  combines ideas from the CountMin and Space Saving algorithms. We compare CMSS and
  CountMax on both synthetic and real datasets. The experimental results show that
  both algorithms achieve 100% recall, and can retrieve the frequent items without
  false negatives even with a limited amount of budgeted memory. Regarding the precision,
  CMSS proves to be robust and independent from all of the parameters, whilst CountMax
  is severely affected by false positives. Finally, both algorithms provide, in practice,
  the same frequency estimation quality. It follows that CMSS outperforms CountMax
  with regard to overall accuracy whilst providing the same frequency estimation quality.

ABS: Efficient and accurate control of incoming inter-domain traffic is critically
  important for Autonomous Systems (ASes). However, it is extremely difficult for
  two neighboring ASes to efficiently control incoming traffic over multiple inter-domain
  links in the current Internet. By contrast, Information-Centric Networking (ICN)
  is a novel network paradigm and has many inherent features, which can support finer
  granularity of routing policies and provide more opportunities to realize Traffic
  Engineering (TE). In this paper, we explore the potentials of ICN in controlling
  incoming inter-domain traffic between neighboring ASes who have multiple inter-domain
  links. We present a heuristic algorithm and extend it with different information
  on network status and content metadata. We implement them in a real prototype and
  compare them with a classic inter-domain TE approach in the current Internet (i.e.,
  the IP-prefixes negotiation approach, IPN) in three scenarios. Three interesting
  conclusions are drawn from extensive experiments on the prototype. First, ICN makes
  it easier to control inter-domain traffic compared with IPN. In particular, ICN
  approaches have shorter negotiation delay and lower negotiation overhead. Second,
  content metadata (e.g., content size) in ICN is quite beneficial to control traffic
  since it can help estimate traffic volumes so as to achieve more accurate control
  of traffic. Third, ICN can efficiently handle the bursty traffic and link failures
  compared with IPN.

ABS: This paper applies an organized flow of feature engineering and machine learning
  to detect distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Feature engineering has
  a focus to obtain the datasets of different dimensions with significant features,
  using feature selection methods of backward elimination, chi2, and information gain
  scores. Different supervised machine learning models are applied on the feature-engineered
  datasets to demonstrate the adaptability of datasets for machine learning under
  optimal tuning of parameters within given sets of values. The results show that
  substantial feature reduction is possible to make DDoS detection faster and optimized
  with minimal performance hit. The paper proposes a strategic-level framework which
  incorporates the necessary elements of feature engineering and machine learning
  with a defined flow of experimentation. The models are also validated with cross-validation
  and evaluated for area-under-curve analyses. It provides comprehensive solutions
  which can be trusted to avoid the overfitting and collinearity problems of data
  while detecting DDoS attacks. In the case study of DDoS datasets, K-nearest neighbors
  algorithm overall exhibits the best performance followed by support vector machine,
  whereas low-dimensional datasets of discrete feature types perform better under
  the Random Forest model as compared to high dimensions with numerical features.
  The accuracy scores of dataset with the lowest number of features remain competitive
  with other datasets under all machine learning models, leading to a substantially
  reduced processing overhead. The experiments show that approximately 68% reduction
  in the feature space is possible with an impact of only about 0.03% on accuracy.

  impedes deployment at a very large scale. As an alternative, big data-based distributed

  light of the high throughput currently offered by 100 Gbit/s links, it turns out
  that state-of-the-art big data solutions fall short of capacity, unless a huge amount

  Wormhole: a streaming engine that circumvents existing limitations by distributing
  the input messages/packets coherently among different off-the-shelf analysis equipment,
  thus reducing costs and equipment. Should the incoming data rate be larger than
  the system throughput, a distributed file system can be used for temporary data
  storage, for subsequent filtering and in-depth analysis. The proposed solution provides
  on-line real-time monitoring metrics with the ability to gain further insights when

ABS: Forecasting fine-grained network traffic is crucial for many network management

  models that are able to predict a wide-variety of network traffic types is not a

  challenges in processing large datasets to train the prediction models. In this
  paper, we present a network traffic prediction framework that uses real network
  traces from a Tier-1 ISP to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network
  and generate predictions at short time scales (<= 30 seconds). In order to reduce
  the number of models needed to capture the very diverse dynamics of the various
  traffic sources, we develop a feature-based clustering framework that acts as a
  preprocessing step in order to group similar time-series together and train a single
  model for each group. Our extensive experimental evaluation study shows that LSTMs
  can indeed be used to predict network traffic with low prediction errors.

ABS: Software-defined networking (SDN) is the key outcome of extensive research efforts
  over the past few decades toward transforming the Internet infrastructure to be
  more programmable, configurable, and manageable. However, critical cyber-threats
  in the SDN-based cloud environment are rising rapidly, in which distributed denial-of-service

  an efficient solution to tackle DDoS attacks in the SDN-based cloud environment.
  We first introduce a new hybrid machine learning model based on support vector machine
  and self-organizing map algorithms to improve the traffic classification. Then,
  we propose an enhanced history-based IP filtering scheme ($eHIPF$ ) to improve the
  attack detection rate and speed. Finally, we introduce a novel mechanism that combines
  both the hybrid machine learning model and the $eHIPF$ scheme to make a DDoS attack
  defender for the SDN-based cloud environment. The testbed is implemented in an SDN-based
  cloud with service function chaining. Through practical experiments, the proposed
  DDoS attack defender is proven to outperform existing mechanisms for DDoS attack
  classification and detection. The comprehensive experiments conducted with various
  DDoS attack levels prove that the proposed mechanism is an effective, innovative
  approach to defend DDoS attacks in the SDN-based cloud.

ABS: 'Incoming 5G networks will evolve regarding how they operate due to the use of
  virtualization technologies. Network functions that are necessary for communication
  will be virtual and will run on top of commodity servers. Among these functions,
  it will be essential to deploy monitoring probes, which will provide information
  regarding how the network is behaving, which will be later analyzed for self-management
  purposes. However, to date, the network probes have needed to be physical to perform
  at link-rates in high-speed networks, and it is challenging to deploy them in virtual
  environments. Thus, it will be necessary to rely on bare-metal accelerators to deal
  with existing input/output (I/O) performance problems. Next, to control the costs
  of implementing these virtual network probes, our approach is to leverage the capabilities
  that current commercial off-the-shelf network cards provide for virtual environments.
  Specifically, to this end, we have implemented HPCAP40vf, which is a driver that
  is GPL-licensed and available for download, for network capture in virtual machines.
  This driver handles the communication with an Intel XL710 40 Gbit/s commercial network
  card to enable a network monitoring application run within a virtual machine. To
  store the captured traffic, we have relied on NVMe drives due to their high transference
  rate, as they are directly connected to the PCIe bus. We have assessed the performance
  of this approach and compared it with DPDK, in terms of both capturing and storing
  the network traffic by measuring the achieved data rates. The evaluation has taken
  into account two virtualization technologies, namely, KVM and Docker, and two access
  methods to the underlying hardware, namely, VirtIO and PCI passthrough. With this
  methodology, we have identified bottlenecks and determined the optimal solution
  in each case to reduce overheads due to virtualization. This approach can also be
  applied to the development of other performance-hungry virtual network functions.
  The obtained results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach: when
  we correctly use the capabilities that current commercial network cards provide,
  our virtual network probe can monitor at 40 Gbit/s with full packet capture and
  storage and simultaneously track the traffic among other virtual network functions
  inside the host and with the external network.'

ABS: Optimizing scheduling and communication of distributed data processing for resource
  and data characteristics is crucial for achieving high performance. Existing approaches
  to such optimizations largely fall into two categories. First, distributed runtimes
  provide low-level policy interfaces to apply the optimizations, but do not ensure
  the maintenance of correct application semantics and thus often require significant
  effort to use. Second, policy interfaces that extend a high-level application programming
  model ensure correctness, but do not provide sufficient fine control. We describe
  Apache Nemo, an optimization framework for distributed dataflow processing that
  provides fine control for high performance, and also ensures correctness for ease
  of use. We combine several techniques to achieve this, including an intermediate
  representation, optimization passes, and runtime extensions. Our evaluation results
  show that Nemo enables composable and reusable optimizations that bring performance
  improvements on par with existing specialized runtimes tailored for a specific deployment
  scenario.

ABS: Carriers network services are distributed, dynamic, and investment intensive.
  Deploying them as virtual network services (VNS) brings the promise of low-cost
  agile deployments, which reduce time to market new services. If these virtual services
  are hosted dynamically over multiple clouds, greater flexibility in optimizing performance
  and cost can be achieved. On the flip side, when orchestrated over multiple clouds,
  the stringent performance norms for carrier services become difficult to meet, necessitating
  novel and innovative placement strategies. In selecting the appropriate combination
  of clouds for placement, it is important to look ahead and visualize the environment
  that will exist at the time a virtual network service is actually activated. This
  serves multiple purposes - clouds can be selected to optimize the cost, the chosen
  performance parameters can be kept within the defined limits, and the speed of placement
  can be increased. In this paper, we propose the P-ART (Predictive-Adaptive Real
  Time) framework that relies on predictive-deductive features to achieve these objectives.
  With so much riding on predictions, we include in our framework a novel concept-drift
  compensation technique to make the predictions closer to reality by taking care
  of long-term traffic variations. At the same time, near real-time update of the
  prediction models takes care of sudden short-term variations. These predictions
  are then used by a new randomized placement heuristic that carries out a fast cloud
  selection using a least-cost latency-constrained policy. An empirical analysis carried
  out using datasets from a queuing-theoretic model and also through implementation
  on CloudLab, proves the effectiveness of the P-ART framework. The placement system
  works fast, placing thousands of functions in a sub-minute time frame with a high
  acceptance ratio, making it suitable for dynamic placement. We expect the framework
  to be an important step in making the deployment of carrier-grade VNS on multi-cloud
  systems, using network function virtualization (NFV), a reality.

ABS: Multimedia computing has evolved as a remarkable technology which provides services
  to view, create, edit, process, and search multimedia contents. All these multimedia
  services have high computational, bandwidth, and storage requirements. Therefore,
  multimedia cloud computing has gained appreciable popularity and acceptance in the
  past one decade. The convenience of cloud computing comes with financial burden.
  One of the fundamental features of cloud computing, which helps in reducing the
  financial worries of the multimedia service providers is the clouds pay-as-you-go
  pricing model. However, the clouds pricing model has also attracted adversaries
  that have hindered the migration of services and/or data by various organisations
  to the cloud. Through the clouds pay-as-you-go pricing model, attackers usually
  target the financial viability of the cloud customers. Therefore, such attacks are
  capable to affect the long term availability of multimedia-services hosted on the
  public cloud. These attacks are known as Fraudulent Resource Consumption (FRC) attack.
  Therefore, research in the area of FRC attack detection and mitigation is important
  in motivating the organisations to adopt the public cloud platform. In this paper,
  we propose a novel approach based on network flow analysis at the victim side to
  detect and mitigate the FRC attacks against cloud-based services. Experiments were
  conducted using real world benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of the
  proposed approach. Experimental outcomes suggest that our proposed approach is able
  to detect and mitigate the FRC attacks with satisfactory accuracy and low overhead.

ABS: The newly emerged software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm provides a flexible
  network management by decoupling the network control logic from the data plane,
  which could effectively resolve many security issues of legacy networks. One of
  such security issues is distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which is a
  rapidly growing network threat. This is usually performed on a target system to
  make an online service unavailable to the users. SDN can easily detect the DDoS
  attack due to the centralized control provisioning and network visibility. At the
  same time, the changes of fundamental architecture and the developments of various
  design entities pose a severe DDoS threat to the SDN platform. This paper presents
  a concise up-to-date review of security concerns of SDN, possible DDoS attack in
  individual layers of SDN and ongoing research efforts on SDN-enabled DDoS detection
  solutions. Based on the findings, an information distance-based flow discriminator
  framework has been discussed, which can discriminate the DDoS traffic during flash
  events, a similar looking legitimate traffic, in SDN environment. The information
  distance metric is used to describe the variations of traffic behavior of such events.
  The simulation results show that the information distance metric can effectively
  identify the DDoS traffic in comparison with other metrics with a higher detection
  rate. The proposed solution can detect the traffic at the edge switch so that the
  attack alert can be raised at the earliest.

ABS: The overwhelming of the request flow beyond the target server capacity leads
  to the service denial to the legitimate users. Because of the servers oversized
  potential, the act of flooding requests beyond the server capacity is carried by
  the malicious attackers from distributed environment called distributed denial-of-service
  attack. Hence, applying the knowledge gained from the findings of previous request
  distributions research works seems to be the suitable strategy to cease the DDOS
  attacks. This strategy indispensable limitation is skipping to detect the new patterns
  of request flooding dug by the attacker at the server from the previous knowledge
  on earlier attack distribution patterns. Therefore, this paper endeavors to contribute
  on how to handle the limitation by proposing a novel-trained ensemble classifier
  with new features which reflects in the traffic-flow properties, so that the traffic-flow
  tuple shows distribution diversity from each other which is considered and attached
  to individual classifier. With the application of KS test, the proposed model tries
  to find the distribution diversity among the traffic-flow tuples using the features
  set. Later, the similar policy is used to discover the distribution resemblance
  amid the renewed tuple as well as the tuples involved to the multiple classifiers
  in the ensemble classification model. The experiment worked out on the voluminous
  traffic flow with visible distribution variety.

  is developed, focusing on different attack scenarios, to investigate the performance
  of a class of ML-based techniques. The evaluation uses different performance metrics,
  including the impact of the Class Imbalance Problem on ML-based DDoS detection.
  The results of the comparative analysis show that no one technique outperforms all
  others in all test cases. Furthermore, the results underscore the need for a method
  oriented feature selection model to enhance the capabilities of ML-based detection
  techniques. Finally, the results show that the class imbalance problem significantly

ABS: Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service
  unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. Therefore, it
  is necessary to propose an effective method to detect DDoS attack from massive data
  traffics. However, the existing schemes have some limitations, including that supervised
  learning methods, need large numbers of labeled data and unsupervised learning algorithms
  have relatively low detection rate and high false positive rate. In order to tackle
  these issues, this paper presents a semi-supervised weighted k-means detection method.
  Specifically, we firstly present a Hadoop-based hybrid feature selection algorithm
  to find the most effective feature sets and propose an improved density-based initial
  cluster centers selection algorithm to solve the problem of outliers and local optimal.
  Then, we provide the Semi-supervised K-means algorithm using hybrid feature selection
  (SKM-HFS) to detect attacks. Finally, we exploit DARPA DDoS dataset, CAIDA DDoS
  attack 2007 dataset, CICIDS DDoS attack 2017 dataset and real-world dataset to carry
  out the verification experiment. The experiment results have demonstrated that the
  proposed method outperforms the benchmark in the respect of detection performance
  and technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) evaluation
  factor.

ABS: During the past few years, the traffic volume of legitimate traffic and attack
  traffic has increased manifolds up to Terabytes per second (Tbps). Because of the
  processing of such a huge traffic volume, it has become implausible to detect high
  rate attacks in time using conventional DDoS defense architectures. At present,
  the majority of the DDoS defense systems are deployed predominantly at the victim-end
  domain But these victim-end defense systems themselves are vulnerable to HR-DDoS
  attacks as the mammoth volume of attack traffic is generated by such type of attacks.
  The insufficient computational resources further make the problem more crucial at
  the victim-end. This paper proposed a distributed and collaborative architecture
  called E-Had that is capable of efficiently processing a large amount of data by
  distributing it among a number of mappers and reducers in a Hadoop based cluster.
  The proposed E-Had system has been comprehensively validated using various publicly
  available benchmarked datasets and real datasets generated in HA-DDoS testbed in
  terms of various detection system evaluation metrics. The experimental results clearly
  show that the proposed detection system is capable of early detection of different
  scenarios of DDoS attacks along with differentiating them from flash crowds.

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have caused great damage to the
  network environment and its services. However, the currently existing single point
  detection methods for DDoS attack cannot achieve satisfying results. This paper
  proposes a DDoS attack situation information fusion method based on Dempster-Shafer
  evidence theory (DS). Firstly, according to the statistics of IP traffic packet,
  destination IP address data packet, and destination port, the traffic threat value
  and the traffic weight value based on the target IP address are respectively calculated
  to indicate the possibility of being attacked and the impact on the network when
  the attack is performed. Then, the above values were fused to obtain the DDoS attack
  fusion feature (Network Flow Combination Relevance, CR) to accurately provide an
  evaluable network situation before and after the attack. Finally, based on the above
  CR values, a DDoS attack feature fusion model was developed. Combined with DS evidence
  theory, the network security situation value was given to evaluate the probability
  of DDoS attack. The experimental results show that compared with similar methods,
  the proposed method can provide evaluable forecast for potential DDoS attack threats,
  improve the situational awareness of DDoS attacks, and reduce false alarm rate,
  missing alarm rate and total error rate.

ABS: Software Defined Networking (SDN) has many advantages over a traditional network.
  The great advantage of SDN is that the network control is physically separated from
  forwarding devices. SDN can solve many security issues of a legacy network. Nevertheless,
  SDN has many security vulnerabilities. The biggest issue of SDN vulnerabilities
  is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The DDoS attack on SDN becomes an
  important problem, and varieties of methods had been applied for detection and mitigation
  purposes. The objectives of this paper are to propose a detection method of DDoS
  attacks by using SDN based technique that will disturb the legitimate users activities
  at the minimum and to propose Advanced Support Vector Machine (ASVM) technique as
  an enhancement of existing Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to detect DDoS
  attacks. ASVM technique is a multiclass classification method consisting of three
  classes. In this paper, we can successfully detect two types of flooding-based DDoS
  attacks. Our detection technique can reduce the training time as well as the testing
  time by using two key features, namely, the volumetric and the asymmetric features.
  We evaluate the results by measuring a false alarm rate, a detection rate, and accuracy.
  The detection accuracy of our detection technique is approximately 97% with the
  fastest training time and testing time.

  Using publicly available datasets, we establish a standard reference for the performance

  An identical experiment over a live SDN shows that the classifiers perform significantly
  poorer compared to the reference standard, exhibiting up to 11.2% lower accuracy,
  30.2% lower precision and detection rate lower than 15% (98% in the reference standard).
  We argue that the interactions between network elements such as the switch and the
  controller significantly significantly affects the performance of ML algorithms
  in a live network which must be accounted for in a real deployment.

  their patterns, ports, and protocols or operation mechanisms are rapidly changed
  and manipulated. Most of the proposed DDoS defense methods have different types
  of drawbacks and limitations. Some of these methods have signature-based defense
  mechanisms that fail to identify new attacks and others have anomaly-based defense
  mechanisms that are limited to specific types of DDoS attacks and yet to be applied
  in open environments. Subsequently, extensive research on applying artificial intelligence
  and statistical techniques in the defense methods has been conducted in order to
  identify, mitigate, and prevent these attacks. However, the most appropriate and
  effective defense features, mechanisms, techniques, and methods for handling such
  attacks remain to be an open question. This review paper focuses on the most common
  defense methods against DDoS attacks that adopt artificial intelligence and statistical
  approaches. Additionally, the review classifies and illustrates the attack types,
  the testing properties, the evaluation methods and the testing datasets that are
  utilized in the methodology of the proposed defense methods. Finally, this review
  provides a guideline and possible points of encampments for developing improved
  solution models of defense methods against DDoS attacks.

ABS: The current paper addresses relevant network security vulnerabilities introduced
  by network devices within the emerging paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT) as well
  as the urgent need to mitigate the negative effects of some types of Distributed
  Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that try to explore those security weaknesses.
  We design and implement a Software-Defined Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that
  reactively impairs the attacks at its origin, ensuring the normal operation of the
  network infrastructure. Our proposal includes an IDS that automatically detects
  several DDoS attacks, and then as an attack is detected, it notifies a Software
  Defined Networking (SDN) controller. The current proposal also downloads some convenient
  traffic forwarding decisions from the SDN controller to network devices. The evaluation
  results suggest that our proposal timely detects several types of cyber-attacks
  based on DDoS, mitigates their negative impacts on the network performance, and
  ensures the correct data delivery of normal traffic. Our work sheds light on the
  programming relevance over an abstracted view of the network infrastructure to timely
  detect a Botnet exploitation, mitigate malicious traffic at its source, and protect
  benign traffic.

ABS: Software-defined networking (SDN) provides a promising architecture for future
  networks, and can provide advantages as central control programmability and global
  view. However, it faces numerous security challenges. Distributed denial of service
  (DDoS) is a security threat to SDN. Most existing schemes only perform DDoS attack
  detection and do not address how to defend and recover after detecting DDoS. In
  this paper, a DDoS attack detection and defense mechanism based on cognitive-inspired
  computing with dual address entropy is proposed. The flow table characteristics
  of the switch are extracted, and a DDoS attack model is built by incorporating the
  support vector machine classification algorithm. This mechanism can realize real-time
  detection and defense at the preliminary stage of the DDoS attack and can restore
  normal communication in time. The experiment shows that our mechanism not only detects
  attacks quickly but also has a high detection rate and low false positive rate.
  More importantly, it can take appropriate defense and recovery measures in the time
  after the attack has been identified.

ABS: This paper presents a hybrid method for the detection of distributed denial-of-service
  (DDoS) attacks that combines feature-based and volume-based detection. Our approach
  is based on an exponential moving average algorithm for decision-making, applied
  to both entropy and packet number time series. The approach has been tested by performing
  a controlled DDoS experiment in a real academic network. The network setup and test
  scenarios including both high-rate and low-rate attacks are described in the paper.
  The performance of the proposed method is compared to the performance of two methods
  that are already known in the literature. One is based on the counting of SYN packets
  and is used for detection of SYN flood attacks, while the other is based on a CUSUM
  algorithm applied to the entropy time series. The results show the advantage of
  our approach compared to methods that are based on either entropy or number of packets
  only.

ABS: The Internet of things requires more internet protocol (IP) addresses than IP
  version 4 (IPv4) can offer. To solve this problem, IP version 6 (IPv6) was developed
  to expand the availability of address spaces. Moreover, it supports hierarchical
  address allocation methods, which can facilitate route aggregation, thus limiting
  expansion of routing tables. An important feature of the IPv6 suites is the neighbor
  discovery protocol (NDP), which is geared towards substitution of the address resolution
  protocol in router discovery and function redirection in IPv4. However, NDP is vulnerable
  to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In this contribution, we present a novel detection
  method for distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks, launched using NDP in IPv6. The proposed
  system uses flow-based network representation, instead of a packet-based one. It
  exploits the advantages of locally weighted learning techniques, with three different
  machine learning models as its base learners. Simulation studies demonstrate that
  the intrusion detection method does not suffer from overfitting issues and offers
  lower computation costs and complexity, while exhibiting high accuracy rates. In
  summary, the proposed system uses six features, extracted from our bespoke dataset
  and is capable of detecting DDoS attacks with 99% accuracy and replayed attacks
  with an accuracy of 91.17%, offering a marked improvement in detection performance
  over state-of-the-art approaches.

ABS: 'Sketch is a compact data structure for network measurements. To achieve fast
  speed, it needs to be held in the on-chip memory (SRAM), which is very small. To
  enable the sketch fit into the on-chip memory, the product of counter size and number
  of counters must be below a certain limit. If we use small counters, e.g., 8 bits,
  some counters will overflow. If we use large counters, e.g., 16 bits per counter,
  the total number of counters will be small, each counter will be shared by more
  flows, leading to poor accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a generic technique:
  self-adaptive counters (SA Counter). When the value of the counter is small, it
  works as a normal counter. When the value of the counter is large, we increment
  it using a predefined probability, so as to represent a large value. Moreover, in
  SA Counter, the probability decreases when the value increases. This technique can
  significantly improve the accuracy of sketches. To verify the effectiveness of SA
  Counter, we apply SA Counter to three typical sketches, and conduct extensive experiments
  on one real dataset and one synthetic dataset. Experimental results show that, compared

ABS: The limited information on the cyberattacks available in the unclassified regime,
  hardens standardizing the analysis. We address the problem of modeling and analyzing
  cyberattacks using a multimodal graph approach. We formulate the stages, actors,
  and outcomes of cyberattacks as a multimodal graph. Multimodal graph nodes include
  cyberattack victims, adversaries, autonomous systems, and the observed cyber events.
  In multimodal graphs, single-modality graphs are interconnected according to their
  interaction. We apply community and centrality analysis on the graph to obtain in-depth
  insights into the attack. In community analysis, we cluster those nodes that exhibit
  strong inter-modal ties. We further use centrality to rank the nodes according to
  their importance. Classifying nodes according to centrality provides the progression
  of the attack from the attacker to the targeted nodes. We apply our methods to two
  popular case studies, namely GhostNet and Putter Panda and demonstrate a clear distinction
  in the attack stages.

  generated by connecting pairwise hosts who communicate with each other. To preserve
  more information about network flows, we also embed node-ranking values and edge-weight

  three modules: a graph simplification module based on diversified filtering rules,
  a graph feature analysis module based on quantitative or semiquantitative analysis,
  and a graph structure analysis module based on several graph mining methods. Furthermore,

  Such anomalies must be detected by considering a sufficiently large sample set rather

  approaches use linear algorithms on a single source of data, such as latency or
  hop count information, to approximate the position of a node in the Internet. In
  contrast, DIP computes low-dimensional representations of nodes that preserve structural
  properties and non-linear relationships across multiple, heterogeneous sources of
  structural information, such as IP, routing, and distance information. Using a large
  real-world data set, we show that DIP learns representations that preserve the real-world
  clustering of the associated nodes and predicts distance between them more than
  30% better than a mean based approach. Furthermore, DIP accurately imputes hop count
  distance to unknown hosts (i.e., not used in training) given only their IP addresses
  and routable prefixes. Our framework is extensible to new data sources and applicable

ABS: The 2-hop Cover labeling of a graph is currently the best data structure for
  answering shortest-path distance queries on large-scale networks, since it combines
  low query times, affordable space occupancy, and reasonable preprocessing effort.
  Its main limit resides in not being suited for dynamic networks since, after a network
  change, (1) queries on the distance can return incorrect values and (2) recomputing
  the labeling from scratch yields unsustainable time overhead. In this article, we
  overcome this limit by introducing the first decremental algorithm able to update
  2-hop Cover labelings under node/edge removals and edge weight increases. We prove
  the new algorithm to be (1) correct, i.e., after each update operation queries on
  the updated labeling return exact values; (2) efficient with respect to the number
  of nodes that change their distance as a consequence of a graph update; and (3)
  able to preserve the minimality of the labeling, a desirable property that impacts
  on both query time and space occupancy. Furthermore, we provide an extensive experimental
  study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method. We consider it both alone
  and in combination with the unique known incremental approach (Akiba et al. 2014),
  thus obtaining the first fully dynamic algorithm for updating 2-hop Cover labelings
  under general graph updates. Our experiments show that the new dynamic algorithms
  are orders of magnitude faster than the from-scratch approach while at the same
  time being able to preserve the quality of the labeling in terms of query time and
  space occupancy, thus allowing one to employ the 2-hop Cover labeling approach in
  dynamic networks with practical performance.

ABS: Recent progress towards unraveling the hidden geometric organization of real
  multiplexes revealed significant correlations across the hyperbolic node coordinates
  in different network layers, which facilitated applications like translayer link
  prediction and mutual navigation. But, are geometric correlations alone sufficient
  to explain the topological relation between the layers of real systems? Here, we
  provide the negative answer to this question. We show that connections in real systems
  tend to persist from one layer to another irrespective of their hyperbolic distances.
  This suggests that in addition to purely geometric aspects, the explicit link formation
  process in one layer impacts the topology of other layers. Based on this finding,
  we present a simple modification to the recently developed geometric multiplex model
  to account for this effect, and show that the extended model can reproduce the behavior
  observed in real systems. We also find that link persistence is significant in all
  considered multiplexes and can explain their layers high edge overlap, which cannot
  be explained by coordinate correlations alone. Furthermore, by taking both link
  persistence and hyperbolic distance correlations into account, we can improve translayer
  link prediction. These findings guide the development of multiplex embedding methods,
  suggesting that such methods should account for both coordinate correlations and
  link persistence across layers.

ABS: The resource-constrained and heterogeneous nature of Internet-of-Things (IoT)
  devices coupled with the placement of such devices in publicly accessible venues
  complicate efforts to secure these devices and the networks they are connected to.
  The Internet-wide deployment of IoT devices also makes it challenging to operate
  security solutions at strategic locations within the network or to identify orchestrated
  activities from seemingly independent malicious events from such devices. Therefore,
  in this paper, we initially seek to determine the magnitude of IoT exploitations
  by examining more than 1 TB of passive measurement data collected from a/8 network
  telescope and by correlating it with 400 GB of information from the Shodan service.
  In the second phase of the study, we conduct in-depth discussions with Internet
  Service Providers (ISPs) and backbone network operators, as well as leverage geolocation
  databases to not only attribute such exploitations to their hosting environment
  (ISPs, countries, etc.) but also to classify such inferred IoT devices based on
  their hosting sector type (financial, education, manufacturing, etc.) and most abused
  IoT manufacturers. In the third phase, we automate the task of alerting realms that
  are determined to be hosting exploited IoT devices. Additionally, to address the
  problem of inferring orchestrated IoT campaigns by solely observing their activities
  targeting the network telescope, we further introduce a theoretically sound technique
  based on L1-norm PCA, and validate the utility of the proposed data dimensionality
  reduction technique against the conventional L2-norm PCA. Specifically, we identify
  in the wild IoT coordinated probing campaigns that are targeting generic ports and
  campaigns specifically searching for open resolvers (for amplification purposes).
  The results reveal more than 120,000 Internet-scale exploited IoT devices, some
  of which are operating in critical infrastructure sectors such as health and manufacturing.
  We also infer 140 large-scale IoT-centric probing campaigns; a sample of which includes
  a worldwide distributed campaign where close to 40% of its population includes video
  surveillance cameras from a single manufacturer, and another very large inferred
  coordinated campaign consisting of more than 50,000 IoT devices. The reported findings
  highlight the insecurity of the IoT paradigm at large and thus demonstrate the importance
  of understanding such evolving threat landscape.

ABS: Can we improve Internet transparency without worsening user anonymity? For a
  long time, researchers have been proposing transparency systems, where traffic reports
  produced at strategic network points help assess network behavior and verify service-level
  agreements or neutrality compliance. However, such reports necessarily reveal when
  certain traffic appeared at a certain network point, and this information could,
  in principle, be used to compromise low-latency anonymity networks like Tor. In
  this paper, we examine whether more Internet transparency necessarily means less
  anonymity. We start from the information that a basic transparency solution would
  publish about a network and study how that would impact the anonymity of the networks
  users. Then we study how to change, in real time, the time granularity of traffic
  reports in order to preserve both user anonymity and report utility. We evaluate
  with real and synthetic data and show that our algorithm can offer a good anonymity/utility
  balance, even in adversarial scenarios where aggregates consist of very few flows.

ABS: Recent years have seen the Internet become a key vehicle for citizens around
  the globe to express political opinions and organize protests. This fact has not
  gone unnoticed, with countries around the world repurposing network management tools
  (e.g., URL filtering products) and protocols (e.g., BGP, DNS) for censorship. Previous
  work has focused on identifying how censorship is performed. However, there is no
  major studies to identify, at a global scale, the networks responsible for performing
  censorship. Also, repurposing network products for censorship can have unintended
  international impact, which we refer to as censorship leakage. While there have
  been anecdotal reports of censorship leakage, there has yet to be a systematic study
  of censorship leakage at a global scale. In this paper, we combine a global censorship
  measurement platform (ICLab) with a general-purpose technique boolean network tomography
  to identify which AS on a network path is performing censorship. At a high-level,
  our approach exploits BGP churn to narrow down the set of potential censoring ASes
  by 97%. We identify 108 censoring ASes and find that the censorship introduced by
  32 of the 108 censoring ASes has an impact on users located outside of the jurisdiction
  of the censoring AS, resulting in the leaking of regional censorship policies.

ABS: Inferring autonomous systems (AS) links types attracted researchers over years.
  In this work, unsupervised machine learning algorithm will be tailored to infer
  the type of these links. Soft and hard clustering approaches will be utilized to
  divide ASes into three tiers. Links between nodes in these tiers will be categories
  as transit or vertical links. Links between ASes in the same tier will be categorized
  as peer-to-peer (P2P) or horizontal links. Five different graph metrics are used
  for ASes clustering into different tiers. Information gain measure is used to differentiate
  between these metrics in ASes tiers formation. To this end, k-means and estimation
  maximization (EM) algorithms are implemented on the AS graph constructed from BGP
  dumps gathered from route servers around the world. Our result shows that centrality
  graph metrics have the highest information gain value for clustering ASes into tiers.
  In addition, our proposed method of categorizing ASes links has more than 92% in
  accuracy compared with CAIDA AS ranking data.

ABS: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) has been the de facto inter-domain routing protocol
  since it was introduced. Its destination-based routing nature, which is not able
  to choose a specific end-to-end AS-level route, might overload some popular peering
  (or inter-AS) links, while making some others underused. This could result in congestion
  and cause service disruption. To cope with the issue of destination-based routing
  of BGP, we resort to Software-Defined Networking (SDN) techniques to propose Effective
  Tunnel-based Multi-path BGP (ETMP-BGP), which is able to obtain the whole control
  of tunnel-based multi-path BGP routing in terms of AS-level routing. In ETMP-BGP,
  destinations provide the feedback of path quality to the source. This feedback is
  used to detect congestions on AS-level routes and adjust such routes accordingly
  in a per-source basis. That is, ETMP-BGP with SDN is able to get the AS-level global
  view of Internet and choose a better AS-level end-to-end BGP routing. Through simulations,
  our results show that ETMP-BGP could mitigate the AS-level congestions and outperforms
  existing BGP schemes.

ABS: Current Internet packet delivery only relies on packets destination IP address
  and forwarding devices neglect the validation of packets IP source address, it makes
  attackers can leverage this flaw to launch attacks with forged IP source address
  so as to meet their vicious purposes and avoid to be tracked. In order to mitigate
  this threat and enhance Internet accountability, many solutions have been proposed
  either from the intra-domain or the inter-domain aspects. However, most of them
  faced with some issues hard to cope with, e.g., low filtering rates, high deployment
  cost. And most importantly, few of them can cover both intra-domain and inter-domain
  areas at the same time. With the central control and edge response pattern, the
  novel network architecture of software defined networking (SDN) possess whole network
  intelligence and distribute control rules directly to edged SDN switches, which
  brings a good opportunity to solve the IP spoofing problem. By taking advantage
  of SDN, in this paper, we propose an SDN-based integrated IP source address validation
  architecture (ISAVA) which can cover both intra- and inter-domain areas and effectively
  lower SDN devices deployment cost, while achieve desirable control granularities
  in the meantime. Specifically, within autonomous system (AS), ISAVA relies on an
  SDN incremental deployment scheme which can achieve IP prefix (subnet)-level validation
  granularity with minimum SDN devices deployment. While among ASes, ISAVA sets up
  border server and establishes a vouch mechanism between allied ASes for signing
  outbound packets so as to achieve AS-level validation granularity. Finally, conducted
  experiments confirm that ISAVA intra-domain scheme can get beyond 90% filtering
  rates with only 10% deployment in average, while the inter-domain scheme can get
  high filtering rates with low system cost and less storage usage.

ABS: The scalability challenge of geometric routing is to construct succinct coordinates
  for all nodes in the network. This paper presents SPrefix-B, a practical greedy
  embedding scheme with succinct coordinates, low path stretches and 100% routing
  success. In comparison to theoretical schemes with near-optimal succinctness, SPrefix-B
  is simple and easy to implement without requiring the whole topology and works well
  in both weighted and unweighted graphs. In contrast to practical schemes, SPrefix-B
  is more succinct and universal. It provides O(log2(n))-bit coordinates for arbitrary
  graphs. This paper first proposes Prefix-B which adopts a bit-string prefix tree
  as a metric space and provides succinct embedding for some power law graphs. Furthermore,
  to extend the succinctness to arbitrary graphs, SPrefix-B is proposed by applying
  two optimizations, the compressed path decomposition and the compressed embedding,
  to Prefix-B. The theoretical analyses and experimental results show that SPrefix-B
  not only guarantees greediness, but also provides succinctness and low path stretches.

ABS: Fueled by a plethora of applications and Internet services, mobile data consumption
  is on the rise. Over the years, mobile operators deployed webproxies to optimize
  HTTP content delivery. Webproxies also produce HTTP-logs which are a fundamental
  data source to understand network/services performance and user behavior. The recent
  surge of HTTPS is progressively reducing such wealth of information, to the point
  that it is unclear whether HTTP-logs are still representative of the overall traffic.
  Unfortunately, HTTPS monitoring is challenging and adds some extra cost which refrains
  operators from turning on the switch. In this work, we study the gap between HTTP
  and HTTPS both quantifying their intrinsic traffic characteristics, and investigating
  the usability of the information that can be logged from their transactions. We
  leverage a 24-hours dataset collected from a web proxy operated by a European mobile
  carrier with more than 10M subscribers. Our quantification of this gap suggests
  that its importance is strictly related to the target analysis.

ABS: With the proliferating number of diverse participants and destinations to reach,
  the Internet construct has become more intricate to assay. Today, Internet Service
  Providers (ISPs) establish resilient networks from multiple providers and broaden
  the number of peering links - as financially as viable. However, the complex structure
  of the global Internet ecosystem and entwined roles of Internet players simply prevent
  us from conducting generalized models for grasping interconnections which could
  be applied globally regardless of the local surroundings. In this paper, the global
  inter-domain Internet topology is scrutinized by the help of interconnection characteristics
  within a country-specific stance. Our study on the Internet ecosystems helps us
  highlight the non-uniformity of interconnections by using both real world metrics
  and network science metrics. One of the significant findings that the analysis yields
  is that presence of well-established Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) in an interconnection
  ecosystem - besides the benefit of bolstering the peering fabric - increases the
  competitive nature of Internet transit market and boosts the inclination to multihome
  for stub networks, thus increases the resilience of national Internet constructs.

GEOLOC: Perth, AU
ABS: Recently, the detection of target link flooding attack which is a new type of
  DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is required. Target link flooding attack is
  used for disconnecting a specific area from the Internet. It is more difficult to
  detect and mitigate this attack than legacy DDoS since attacking flows do not reach
  the target region. Among several schemes for target link flooding attack, the scheme
  focusing on traceroute is gathering attention. The idea behind that is the attacker
  needs to send traceroute to investigate the topology around targeted region before
  attack starts. That scheme detects the attack by finding rapid increase of traceroute.
  However, it cannot work when attackers traceroute ratio is low. In this paper, we
  propose traceroute-based target link flooding attack detection scheme by analyzing
  hop count to the destination. Since the attacker must choose the link flooded to
  disconnect the target area, the destinations of attackers traceroutes are concentrated
  within several hops from the target link while legitimate users ones are distributed
  uniformly. By analyzing the number of traceroutes as per hop counts, the change
  can be emphasized and the attack symptom might be more easily captured. By computer
  simulations, we first prove the above hypotheses and show that our scheme has more
  robustness compared with the conventional scheme.

ABS: IP spoofing has been a persistent Internet security threat for decades. While
  research solutions exist that can help an edge network detect spoofed and reflected
  traffic, the sheer volume of such traffic requires handling further upstream. We
  propose RESECT---a self-learning spoofed packet filter that detects spoofed traffic
  upstream from the victim by combining information about the traffics expected route
  and about the senders response to a few packet drops. RESECT is unique in its ability
  to autonomously learn correct filtering rules when routes change, or when routing
  is asymmetric or multipath. Its operation has a minimal effect on legitimate traffic,
  while it quickly detects and drops spoofed packets. In isolated deployment, RESECT
  greatly reduces spoofed traffic to the deploying network and its customers, to 8-26%
  of its intended rate. If deployed at 50 best-connected autonomous systems, RESECT
  protects the deploying networks and their customers from 99% of spoofed traffic,
  and filters 91% of spoofed traffic sent to any other destination. RESECT is thus
  both a practical and highly effective solution for IP spoofing defense.

  in some networks but about hosts on edge networks. Although the rDNS names of routers
  have been decoded and their naming patterns verified by researchers, the information
  extracted from edge host rDNS names has been limited to intuitive keywords. In this
  paper, we develop a methodology for identifying and analyzing rDNS names for broadband
  Internet end hosts without using any pre-defined keyword. With this methodology,
  we study whether ISPs use intuitive keywords in their rDNS names and whether rDNS
  names embed correct information (e.g., whether keyword cable indicates cable clients
  but not fiber or DSL clients).

ABS: Routing anomalies, beyond simple leaks, are occurring on the order of tens of
  thousands a year. These may be accidents, but there is anecdotal evidence that indicates
  criminal intent. There are case studies that illustrate the use of these for national
  intelligence. Any given anomaly could be an accident, a crime, or an attack. Although
  it is impossible to directly observe the motivation of those who generate these
  anomalies, aggregate data about the sources of these anomalies is available. Here
  we leverage tools of macroeconomics to provide insights into the possible nature
  of these anomalies. We offer an empirical investigation using multiple linear regression
  and unsupervised learning to analyze data over a four-year period in order to better
  understand the nature of routing anomalies. If routing anomalies are a result of
  limited technical competence, then countries with low levels of education, few technology
  exports, and less expertise should be over-represented. If routing anomalies are
  leveraged by criminals for profit, then economic theories and analytical approaches
  from criminology should show statistical significance. Or, if routing anomalies
  are primarily used by national intelligence agencies to attack either internal dissidents
  or those outside their borders, then the presence of conflict and measures of quality
  of governance are possible indicators. We examine anomalies as likely due to incompetence,
  potential ecrime, or intelligence operations using macroeconomics by leveraging
  three theories from criminology and global measures of technology adoption. We found
  that exports of technology were not statistically significant, undermining the argument
  for incompetence. We also found support for the possibility that anomalies are driven
  by crime, specifically for the guardianship and relative deprivation theories of
  crime. In addition to these findings from regression analysis, clustering indicates
  that civil conflict and surveillance are associated with the disproportionate origination
  of routing anomalies. This supports the possibility of use of routing anomalies
  for national intelligence.

ABS: Providing fine grained traffic measurement is crucial for many network management
  tasks such as traffic engineering, anomaly detection, traffic accounting, and load
  balancing. Software-defined networks can potentially enable fine-grained measurement
  by providing statistics for each forwarding rule of an OpenFlow-enabled switch.
  However, providing fine grained traffic measurement in a scalable fashion in hardware
  switches poses significant challenges due to the limitations in the size of the
  TCAMs that fit only a relatively small number of rules compared to the number of
  active flows in the network. In this paper, we present DeepFlow, a framework for
  scalable software-defined measurement that relies on an efficient mechanism that
  a) adaptively detect the most active source and destination prefixes in the network,
  b) collects fine-grained flow-size measurements for the most active prefixes and
  coarse grained for the less active ones, and c) uses historical measurements in
  order to train a cloud-based Deep Learning model that can be used to provide short-term
  predictions whenever exact flow counters cannot be placed at a switch due to its
  limited resources. Thus the number of fine-grained flows measured can increase significantly
  without the need to use other flow sampling solutions that loose accuracy. An extensive
  experimental evaluation using a prototype implementation and real network traces
  shows that DeepFlow can provide very high accuracy for estimating flow sizes at
  various aggregation levels.

ABS: Servers in a network are typically assigned a static identity. Static assignment
  of identities is a cornerstone for adversaries in finding targets. Moving Target
  Defense (MTD) mutates the environment to increase unpredictability for an attacker.
  On another side, Software Defined Networks (SDN) facilitate a global view of a network
  through a central control point. The potential of SDN can not only make network
  management flexible and convenient, but it can also assist MTD to enhance attack
  surface obfuscation. In this paper, we propose an effective framework for the prevention,
  detection, and mitigation of flooding-based Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Our
  framework includes a light-weight SDN assisted MTD strategy for network reconnaissance
  protection and an efficient approach for tackling DoS attacks using Software Defined-Internet
  Exchange Point (SD-IXP). To assess the effectiveness of the MTD strategy and DoS
  mitigation scheme, we set two different experiments. Our results confirm the effectiveness
  of our framework. With the MTD strategy in place, at maximum, barely 16% reconnaissance
  attempts were successful while the DoS attacks were accurately detected with false
  alarm rate as low as 7.1%.

ABS: Autonomic self-management is a key challenge for next-generation networks. This
  paper proposes an automated analysis framework to infer knowledge in 5G networks
  with the aim to understand the network status and to predict potential situations
  that might disrupt the network operability. The framework is based on the Endsley
  situational awareness model, and integrates automated capabilities for metrics discovery,
  pattern recognition, prediction techniques and rule-based reasoning to infer anomalous
  situations in the current operational context. Those situations should then be mitigated,
  either proactive or reactively, by a more complex decision-making process. The framework
  is driven by a use case methodology, where the network administrator is able to
  customize the knowledge inference rules and operational parameters. The proposal
  has also been instantiated to prove its adaptability to a real use case. To this
  end, a reference network traffic dataset was used to identify suspicious patterns
  and to predict the behavior of the monitored data volume. The preliminary results
  suggest a good level of accuracy on the inference of anomalous traffic volumes based
  on a simple configuration.

ABS: DDoS attack is one of the major concerns for network and cloud service providers,
  due to its substantial impact on revenue/cost and especially on their reputation.
  Also, network administrators are looking for solutions to manage voluminous data
  traffic. SDN is an emerging networking paradigm that provides a flexible network
  management. Hence, SDN is being widely adopted for wired, wireless, and mobile networks.
  Apart from a single point of failure (the controller), an attacker can target SDN
  at various levels by DDoS attacks. Existing solutions either focus on a particular
  attack type or require cumbersome alterations in SDN infrastructure. In this paper,
  we propose a comprehensive, yet effective and lightweight approach to detect various
  fundamentally different DDoS attacks in SDN. Our approach relies on sequential analysis.
  We employ a non-parametric change point detection technique called Cumulative Sum
  (CuSum). Our framework also includes an adaptive threshold scheme that adapts with
  the changing traffic pattern. Additionally, our framework can be tuned to suffice
  critical security requirements such as high detection rate and low false alarm rate.
  We evaluated the effectiveness of our solution using CAIDA Internet traces as well
  as DARPA intrusion detection evaluation dataset. Our results confirm the effectiveness
  of our mechanism. In particular, average false alarm rate in our experiments was
  under 11.64%. On average, our method is able to detect DDoS attacks within 4.15
  seconds.

ABS: "Traffic analysis is the practice of inferring sensitive information from communication
  patterns, particularly packet timings and packet sizes. Traffic analysis is increasingly
  becoming relevant to security and privacy with the growing use of encryption and
  other evasion techniques that render content-based analysis of network traffic impossible.
  The literature has investigated traffic analysis for various application scenarios,
  from tracking stepping stone cybercriminals to compromising anonymity systems. The
  major challenge to existing traffic analysis mechanisms is scaling to todays exploding
  volumes of network traffic, i.e., they impose high storage, communications, and
  computation overheads. In this paper, we aim at addressing this scalability issue
  by introducing a new direction for traffic analysis, which we call \emph{compressive
  traffic analysis}. The core idea of compressive traffic analysis is to compress
  traffic features, and perform traffic analysis operations on such compressed features
  instead of on raw traffic features (therefore, improving the storage, communications,
  and computation overheads of traffic analysis due to using smaller numbers of features).
  To compress traffic features, compressive traffic analysis leverages linear projection
  algorithms from compressed sensing, an active area within signal processing. We
  show that these algorithms offer unique properties that enable compressing network
  traffic features while preserving the performance of traffic analysis compared to
  traditional mechanisms. We introduce the idea of compressive traffic analysis as
  a new generic framework for scalable traffic analysis. We then apply compressive
  traffic analysis to two widely studied classes of traffic analysis, namely, flow
  correlation and website fingerprinting. We show that the compressive versions of
  state-of-the-art flow correlation and website fingerprinting schemes\textemdash
  significantly\textemdash outperform their non-compressive (traditional) alternatives,
  e.g., the compressive version of Houmansadr et al. [44]s flow correlation is two
  orders of magnitude faster, and the compressive version of Wang et al. [77] fingerprinting
  system runs about 13 times faster. We believe that our study is a major step towards
  scaling traffic analysis."

ABS: Lists are one of the most fundamental and ubiquitous data structures. A self-organizing
  list can adjust the structure according to the request sequence to improve average
  access time. However, it is a challenge to obtain a practical concurrent self-organizing
  linked-list with lock-free property, which guarantees that some operation finishes
  when any thread executes a finite number of steps. This paper implements a novel
  lock-free self-organizing list whose items are moved to the front when being requested.
  The implementation uses a new log method and a new help mechanism. The log consists
  of operation nodes which record the execution history. Friend chains are formed
  during list traversal to help related operations. This paper also introduces a speed-up
  variation which is more pragmatic. Furthermore, this paper presents a comprehensive
  evaluation in experiments on non-uniform data set. Experiment demonstrates the advantages
  of the new linked-lists among other algorithms in throughput and scalability. On
  requests derived from real workloads, it achieves 22% to 184% speedup than the existing
  concurrent lists.

ABS: 'Approximate computing aims for efficient execution of workflows where an approximate
  output is sufficient instead of the exact output. The idea behind approximate computing
  is to compute over a representative sample instead of the entire input dataset.
  Thus, approximate computing --- based on the chosen sample size --- can make a systematic
  trade-off between the output accuracy and computation efficiency. Unfortunately,
  the state-of-the-art systems for approximate computing primarily target batch analytics,
  where the input data remains unchanged during the course of computation. Thus, they
  are not well-suited for stream analytics. This motivated the design of StreamApprox
  --- a stream analytics system for approximate computing. To realize this idea, we
  designed an online stratified reservoir sampling algorithm to produce approximate
  output with rigorous error bounds. Importantly, our proposed algorithm is generic
  and can be applied to two prominent types of stream processing systems: (1) batched
  stream processing such as Apache Spark Streaming, and (2) pipelined stream processing
  such as Apache Flink. To showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm, we implemented
  StreamApprox as a fully functional prototype based on Apache Spark Streaming and
  Apache Flink. We evaluated StreamApprox using a set of microbenchmarks and real-world
  case studies. Our results show that Spark- and Flink-based StreamApprox systems
  achieve a speedup of 1.15x - 3x  compared to the respective native Spark Streaming
  and Flink executions, with varying sampling fraction of 80% to 10%. Furthermore,
  we have also implemented an improved baseline in addition to the native execution
  baseline --- a Spark-based approximate computing system leveraging the existing
  sampling modules in Apache Spark. Compared to the improved baseline, our results
  show that StreamApprox achieves a speedup of 1.1x - 2.4x while maintaining the same
  accuracy level.'

ABS: In network traffic monitoring, a very important analysis is to find heavy hitters.
  That is, finding those flows that use most resources in a given network link. This
  information can be very useful for security or traffic management purposes. Though
  this analysis might seem easy to implement, since it is essentially based on counting,
  the fact is that doing it at 100 Gbit/s rates is far from trivial. In 100 Gbit/s
  Ethernet (100 GbE), up to 148 million packets per second can be received, thus making
  it very difficult to parse packets and maintain counters at such rate. In this paper,
  we leverage the integrated 100G Ethernet Subsystem available in Xilinx UltraScale
  devices to implement a heavy hitter detector for 100 GbE in a VCU108 evaluation
  kit. Thanks to the integration of the Count Sketch algorithm with a priority list
  and a network packet parser, the proposed architecture is able to work at line rate
  for average packet sizes bigger than 215 bytes. The work presents a theoretical
  analysis of the error, as well as the technical details of the proposed solution.
  The implementation has been validated using real-world traces, obtaining an average
  error of 1.29%.

ABS: A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an austere menace to extensively
  used Internet-based services. The in-time detection of DDoS attacks poses a tough
  challenge to network security. Revealing a low-rate DDoS (LR-DDoS) attack is comparatively
  more difficult in modern high speed networks, since it can easily conceal itself
  due to its similarity with legitimate traffic, and so eluding current anomaly based
  detection methods. This paper investigates the aptness and impetus of the information
  theory-based generalized entropy (GE) and generalized information distance (GID)
  metrics in detecting different types of DDoS attacks. The results of GE and GID
  metrics are compared with Shannon entropy and other popular information divergence
  measures. In addition, the feasibility of using these metrics in discriminating
  a high-rate DDoS (HR-DDoS) attack from a similar looking legitimate flash event
  (FE) is also verified. We used real and synthetically generated datasets to elucidate
  the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed detection scheme in detecting different
  types of DDoS attacks and FEs. The results clearly show that the GE and GID metrics
  perform well in comparison with other metrics and have reduced false positive rate
  (FPR).

ABS: The internet network is mostly victimized to the Distributed Denial of Service
  (DDOS) attack, which is one that intentionally occupies the computing resources
  and bandwidth in order to deny that services to potential users. The attack scenario
  is to flood the packets immensely. If the attack source is single, then the attack
  is referred as denial of service (DOS) and if attack is sourced from divergent servers,
  then it is referred as DDOS. Over a decade many of the researchers considered the
  detection and prevention of DDOS attack as research objective and succeeded to deliver
  few significant DDOS detection and prevention strategies. How fast and early detection
  of DDOS attack is done in streaming network transactions is still a significant
  research objective in present level of internet usage. Unfortunately the current
  benchmarking DDOS attack detection strategies are failing to justify the objective
  called fast and early detection of DDOS attack. In order to this, in this paper
  we devised a Bio-Inspired Anomaly based application layer DDoS attack (App-DDOS
  Attack) detection that is in the aim of achieving fast and early detection. The
  proposed model is a bio-inspired bat algorithm that used to achieve the fast and
  early detection of the App-DDOS by HTTP flood. The experiments were carried out
  on bench marking CAIDA dataset and the results delivered are boosting the significance
  of the proposed model to achieve the objective of the paper.

ABS: Low-rate Distributed Denial-of-Service (low-rate DDoS) attacks are a new challenge

  normal traffic, to throttle legitimate flows. In this paper, we propose a measurement-expectation
  of packet size-that is based on the distribution difference of the packet size to
  distinguish two typical low-rate DDoS attacks, the constant attack and the pulsing
  attack, from legitimate traffic. The experimental results, obtained using a series
  of real datasets with different times and different tolerance factors, are presented
  to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed measurement. In addition, extensive
  experiments are performed to show that the proposed measurement can detect the low-rate
  DDoS attacks not only in the short and long terms but also for low packet rates
  and high packet rates. Furthermore, the false-negative rates and the adjudication
  distance can be adjusted based on the detection sensitivity requirements.

  information distance measures such as Kullbeck-Leibler, Hellinger and Manhattan
  distance to measure the flow similarity among the traffic. Further the detection
  parameters such as Detection Rate, Classification Rate, Precision Rate and False
  Positive Rate is computed and shows that the Kullbeck-Leibler detection metric effectively
  detects the attack as compared to the other two.

ABS: Flooding DDoS and Flash Crowds (FC) are difficult to be discriminated from network
  layer because both of them have too many statistical similarities. If attacker learnt
  those statistical difference and could produce some mimicking traffic which have
  little difference from traffic produced by legitimate uses in FC, which means existing
  methods will uselessness. In order to verify the existence of this possibility,
  this paper proposes an idea that employed Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks
  (LSGANs) to generate mimicking traffic to make the defense system uselessness. By
  experiments evaluated, the proposed idea could mimicking traffic to fool the defense
  system. The proposed idea mainly focuses on traffic statistical information of each
  Bot and legitimate user, does not rely on network environments, so the possibility
  of this mimicking attack happened could be existed in other networks, such as wired
  network, wireless network and mobile network.

ABS: -Discriminating Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS) from Flash Crowds
  (FC) is a tough and challenging problem. If attackers could generate mimicking traffic
  which have little difference from the traffic produced by legitimate users in FC,
  are existing methods and defense systems still able to distinguish DDoS from FC?
  To verify the possibility of the existence of this mimicking attack and prove the
  existing methods cannot discriminate this attack from FC, this paper proposes an
  idea employed Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGAN) to generate
  mimicking traffic based on a statistical features achieved from an extensive analysis
  of user traffic behavior of DDoS and FC. Then to establish an efficient defense
  system employed Random Forest to prove it can achieve better performance on real
  network traffic traces, but cannot discriminate this mimicking attack traffic from
  FC. The experiments results show the proposed idea can generate this mimicking attack
  traffic and the defense system cannot discriminate it from FC. In addition, a comparison
  with GAN has been made to show that LSGAN is better than GAN in performance

ABS: 'Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack has been identified as one of the
  most serious threats to Internet services. The attack denies service to legitimate
  users by flooding and consuming network resources of the target server. We propose
  a distributed defense mechanism that filters out malicious traffic and allows significant
  legitimate traffic during an actual attack. We investigate the features of network
  traffic that can be used to do such filtration and describe a history-based profiling
  algorithm to identify legitimate traffic. We use Bloom filters to efficiently implement
  the history-based profile model, which serves to reduce the communication and computation
  costs. To further improve communication and computation costs, we describe two optimizations:
  (a) using only three octets of the IP address to generate the history profile, and
  (b) a data structure called Compacted Bloom Filter, which is a modified version
  of a regular Bloom filter. We use these notions as building blocks to describe a
  distributed framework called Collaborative Filtering for filtering attack traffic
  as far away as possible from the target server. The proposed techniques identify
  a set of nodes that are best suited for filtering attack traffic, and places the
  Bloom filters in these locations. The approach is evaluated on different real-world
  data sets from Auckland University, CAIDA, and Colorado State University. Under
  different experimental settings, we demonstrate that 70-95% attack traffic can be
  filtered by our approach while allowing the flow of a similar percentage of legitimate

ABS: 'Advanced Payload Analyzer Pre-processor (APAP) is an intrusion detection system

  its detection algorithm as dynamic pre-processor of Snort. By working together,
  a highly effective system to known attacks (by passing Snort rules) and equally
  effective against new and unknown attacks is obtained. APAP consists of two phases:
  training and detection. During training, a statistical model of legitimate network
  traffic through the techniques Bloom filter and n-grams is created. Then results
  obtained by analyzing a dataset of attacks with this model are compared. Consequently,
  a set of rules able to determine whether a payload corresponds to malware or otherwise
  legitimate traffic is obtained. During detection, monitored traffic is passed by
  the Bloom filter which is created in the training phase, and the obtained results
  are compared with rules. Training requires two datasets: a collection of habitual

  improvements compared with similar proposals. The most outstanding is a new method
  for filling Bloom filters and thereby building usage models. The implementation

ABS: In response to the rapid development of the Internet in recent years, numerous
  new Internet services have been developed to satisfy user needs. However, numerous
  security issues were also emerged. Because of current Internet protocols, attackers
  can hide their IP addresses when initiating attacks on targets, especially on the
  Internet of Things (IoT) frameworks. As a result, discovering the true location
  of attackers is difficult, especially the attacks are initiates from the personal
  and private devices that previously lacked Internet connection. Numerous researchers
  have proposed various packet traceback schemes. Our proposed scheme is a packet
  marking scheme that uses a 32-bit space in the packet header to record attack paths
  and the time to live field to decrease the false positive rate of tracebacks. This
  enables single-packet tracebacks through packet marking and does not require additional
  storage space on routers for recording attack path data.

ABS: Cloud computing has become a widely used computing paradigm providing on-demand
  computing and storage capabilities based on pay-as-you-go model. Recently, many
  organizations, especially in the field of big data, have been adopting the cloud
  model to perform data analytics through leasing powerful Virtual Machines (VMs).
  VMs can be attractive targets to attackers as well as untrusted cloud providers
  who aim to get unauthorized access to the business critical-data. The obvious security
  solution is to perform data analytics on encrypted data through the use of cryptographic
  keys as that of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). However, it is very easy
  to obtain AES cryptographic keys from the VMs Random Access Memory (RAM). In this
  paper, we present a novel key-scattering (KS) approach to protect the cryptographic
  keys while encrypting/decrypting data. Our solution is highly portable and interoperable.
  Thus, it could be integrated within todays existing cloud architecture without the
  need for further modifications. The feasibility of the approach has been proven
  by implementing a functioning prototype. The evaluation results show that our approach
  is substantially more resilient to brute force attacks and key extraction tools
  than the standard AES algorithm, with acceptable execution time.

ABS: 'For many practical applications, it is a fundamental problem to estimate the
  flow cardinalities over big network data consisting of numerous flows (especially
  a large quantity of mouse flows mixed with a small number of elephant flows, whose
  cardinalities follow a power-law distribution). Traditionally the research on this
  problem focused on using a small amount of memory to estimate each flows cardinality
  from a large range (up to ${10}^{{9}}$ ). However, although the memory needed for
  each individual flow has been greatly compressed, when there is an extremely large
  number of flows, the overall memory demand can still be very high, exceeding the
  availability under some important scenarios, such as implementing online measurement
  modules in network processors using only on-chip cache memory. In this paper, instead
  of allocating a separated data structure (called estimator) for each flow, we take
  a different path by viewing all the flows together as a whole: Each flow is allocated
  with a virtual estimator, and these virtual estimators share a common memory space.
  We discover that sharing at the multi-bit register level is superior than sharing
  at the bit level. We propose a unified framework of virtual estimators that allows
  us to apply the idea of sharing to an array of cardinality estimation solutions,
  e.g., HyperLogLog and PCSA, achieving far better memory efficiency than the best
  existing work. Our experiment shows that the new solution can work in a tight memory
  space of less than 1 bit per flow or even one tenth of a bit per flow - a quest
  that has never been realized before.'

ABS: End-to-end round-trip times (RTTs), which measure the time when the source transmitted
  data and when it received confirmation that the data was received, have been used
  by several Internet applications and protocols as a way to estimate network load
  and congestion. However, the Internets ever increasing size and complexity pose
  many challenges to the study of the RTT. RTTs stochastic nature combined with diverse
  network topologies, technologies, and workloads are part of the problem, as well
  as difficulty in acquiring representative RTT samples or testing how RTT measurements
  are affected by changes in protocols. As part of the answer to these challenges,
  this paper presents a characterization study of RTT traces collected from both real-
  as well as simulated networked environments. We verify that temporal- and spatial
  factors cause RTT behavior to exhibit particular trends. Using rigorous analytical
  methodology, we also confirm that RTT distributions can be modeled as a power law.
  We then use RTT power law statistics to validate and fine-tune simulation environments.

ABS: Internet and organizational network security is still threatened by devastating
  malicious activities. Given the continuous escalation of such attacks in terms of
  their frequency, sophistication and stealthiness, it is of paramount importance
  to generate effective cyber threat intelligence that aims at inferring, attributing,
  characterizing and mitigating such misdemeanors. Nevertheless, such imperative tasks
  are partially impeded by the lack of correlation approaches that can produce prompt
  and accurate actionable intelligence by investigating various network traffic sources.
  To this end, this paper proposes a simple yet effective approach to generically
  correlate network traffic for cyber security purposes. The approach uniquely exploits
  Bloom filters to infer similarities between the analyzed network traffic while eliminating
  false negatives and managing a very low and a measurable false positive rate. We
  demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by empirically evaluating
  it using 10 GB of real darknet data and close to 15 thousand malware traffic samples.
  The outcome is rendered by hundreds of inferred and attributed Internet-scale infections,
  which we corroborate using third-party publicly accessible threat repositories.
  We envision that the proposed approach could be leveraged as an effective correlation
  component in complex security information and event management systems to provide
  metrics that would aid in characterizing and comprehending various network security
  activities and incidents.

ABS: We introduce new dynamic set intersection data structures, which we call 2-3
  cuckoo filters and hash tables. These structures differ from the standard cuckoo
  hash tables and cuckoo filters in that they choose two out of three locations to

  of two structures will have at least one common location in both structures. We
  demonstrate the utility of these structures by using them in improved algorithms
  for listing triangles and answering set intersection queries in internal or external
  memory. For a graph G of n vertices and m edges, our internal-memory triangle listing
  algorithm runs in O(m|(alfa(G)log w)/w| + k) expected time, where alfa(G) is the
  arboricity of G, w is the number of bits in a machine word, and k is the number
  of output triangles. Our external-memory algorithm uses O(sort(n,alfa(G))+ sort(m|(alfa(G)log
  w)/w|) + sort(k)) expected number of I/Os.

ABS: The original design of the Internet was a resilient, distributed system, that
  maybe able to route around (and therefore recover from) massive disruption - up
  to and including nuclear war. However, network routing effects and business decisions
  cause traffic to often be routed through a relatively small set of Autonomous Systems
  (ASes). This is not merely an academic issue; it has practical implications - some
  of these frequently appearing ASes are hosted in censorious nations. Other than
  censoring their own citizens network access, such ASes may inadvertently filter
  traffic for other foreign customer ASes. In this paper, we examine the extent of
  routing centralization in the Internet; identify the major players who control the
  Internet backbone; and point out how many of these are, in fact, under the jurisdiction
  of censorious countries (specifically, Russia, China, and India). Further, we show
  that China and India are not only the two largest nations by number of Internet
  users, but that many users in free and democratic countries are affected by collateral
  damage caused due to censorship by such countries.

ABS: 'Decoy Routing, the use of routers (rather than end hosts) as proxies, is a new
  direction in anti-censorship research. Decoy Routers (DRs), placed in Autonomous
  Systems, proxy traffic from users; so the adversary, e.g. a censorious government,
  attempts to avoid them. It is quite difficult to place DRs so the adversary cannot
  route around them -- for example, we need the cooperation of 850 ASes to contain
  China alone [1]. In this paper, we consider a different approach. We begin by noting
  that DRs need not intercept all the network paths from a country, just those leading
  to Overt Destinations, i.e. unfiltered websites hosted outside the country (usually
  popular ones, so that client traffic to the OD does not make the censor suspicious).
  Our first question is -- How many ASes are required for installing DRs to intercept
  a large fraction of paths from e.g. China to the top-n websites (as per Alexa)?
  How does this number grow with n ? To our surprise, the same few (~30) ASes intercept
  over 90% of paths to the top n sites worldwide, for n = 10, 20...200 and also to
  other destinations. Investigating further, we find that this result fits perfectly
  with the hierarchical model of the Internet [2]; our first contribution is to demonstrate
  with real paths that the number of ASes required for a world-wide DR framework is
  small (~30). Further, censor nations attempts to filter traffic along the paths
  transiting these 30 ASes will not only block their own citizens, but others residing
  in foreign ASes. Our second contribution in this paper is to consider the details
  of DR placement: not just in which ASes DRs should be placed to intercept traffic,
  but exactly where in each AS. We find that even with our small number of ASes, we
  still need a total of about 11, 700 DRs. We conclude that, even though a DR system
  involves far fewer ASes than previously thought, it is still a major undertaking.
  For example, the current routers cost over 10.3 billion USD, so if Decoy Routing
  at line speed requires all-new hardware, the cost alone would make such a project
  unfeasible for most actors (but not for major nation states).'

ABS: Although cybercrime and cyber threats are increasing significantly, yet prevention
  and security of the critical infrastructure are still far from perfect. The internet
  has no protection against malicious packet modifications. Attackers exploit such
  vulnerabilities to forge the source IP addresses while instigating an attack. Consequently,
  investigating cybercrime is becoming extremely difficult. The best antidote would
  be to weed out the problem at its root by identifying the source of the attack.
  The objective of this study is to propose an IP traceback scheme that can identify
  the origin of an attack with a single packet with minimum computational and storage
  overhead while ensuring a high degree of accuracy. Compared to the state-of-the-art
  single packet IP traceback technique, the proposed scheme entails lesser computation
  overhead. According to CAIDA topology dataset, it requires only 320 kB of storage
  on each router. Storage requirement is several thousand times lesser than the pioneer
  single packet traceback scheme and 6.25 times lesser than the state-of-the-art traceback
  scheme. It has the better endurance to the change in topology compared with the
  state-of-the-art schemes. It identifies the attack node with high accuracy and minimal
  false positive. The obtained result has been validated to demonstrate its statistical
  significance.

ABS: There has been significant research effort into peer-to-peer (P2P) massively
  multi-user virtual environments (MMVEs). A number of architectures have been proposed
  to implement the P2P approach; however, the development of fully distributed MMVEs
  has met with a number of challenges. In this work, we address one of the key remaining
  challenges of state consistency and persistency in P2P MMVEs. Having reviewed state
  management and persistency architectures currently receiving research attention,
  we have identified deficiencies such as lack of load balancing, responsiveness,
  and scalability. To address these deficiencies, we present Pithos-a reliable, responsive,
  secure, load-balanced, and scalable distributed storage system, suited to P2P MMVEs.
  Pithos is designed specifically for P2P MMVEs, and we show that it improves the
  reliability and responsiveness of storage architectures as compared to existing
  P2P state persistency architectures. Pithos is implemented as an OverSim simulation
  running on the OMNeT++ network simulation framework. It is evaluated using up to
  10,400 peers, with realistic latency profiles, with up to 15.8 million storage and

ABS: The number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices actively communicating across
  the Internet is continually increasing as these devices are deployed across a variety
  of sectors, constantly transferring private data across the Internet. Due to the
  extensive deployment of such devices, the continuous discovery and persistence of
  IoT-centric vulnerabilities in protocols, applications, hardware and the improper
  management of such IoT devices has resulted in the rampant, uncontrolled spread
  of malware threatening consumer IoT devices. To this end, this work adopts a novel,
  macroscopic methodology for fingerprinting Internet-scale compromised IoT devices,
  revealing crucial cyber threat intelligence on the insecurity of consumer IoT devices.
  By developing data-driven techniques rooted in machine learning methods and analyzing
  3.6 TB of network traffic data, we discover 855,916 compromised IP addresses, with
  310,164 fingerprinted as IoT. Further analysis reveals China and Brazil to be hosting
  the most significant population of compromised IoT devices (100,000 and 55,000 respectively).
  Additionally, we provide a longitudinal analysis on data from one year ago against
  this work, revealing the evolving trends of IoT exploitation, such as the increased
  number of vendors targeted by malware, rising from 50 to 131. Moreover, countries
  such as China (420% increased infected IoT count) and Indonesia (177% increased
  infected IoT count) have seen notably high increases in infection rates. Lastly,
  we compare our geographic results against Global Cybersecurity Index ratings, verifying
  that countries with high GCI ratings such as the Netherlands and Germany had relatively
  low infection rates. However, upon further inspection, we find that the GCI rate
  does not accurately represent the consumer IoT market, with countries such as China
  and Russia being rated with high CGI scores, yet hosting a large population of infected
  consumer IoT devices.

ABS: The analysis of large-scale cyber attacks, which utilized millions of exploited
  Internet of Things (IoT) devices to perform malicious activities, highlights the
  significant role of compromised IoT devices in enabling evasive and effective attacks
  at scale. Motivated by the shortage of empirical data related to the deployment
  of IoT devices, and the lack of understanding about compromised devices and their
  unsolicited activities, in this paper, we leverage a big data analytics framework
  (Apache Spark) to design and develop a scalable system for automated detection of
  compromised IoT devices and characterization of their unsolicited activities. The
  system utilizes IoT device information and passive network measurements obtained
  from a large network telescope, while implementing an array of data-driven methodologies
  rooted in data mining and machine learning techniques, to provide a macroscopic
  view of IoT-generated malicious activities. We evaluate the system with more than
  4TB of passive network measurements and demonstrate its effectiveness in the network
  forensic investigation of compromised devices and their activities, in near real-time.
  In addition, we empirically analyze and elaborate on the capabilities of the developed
  system as a scalable infrastructure, which can support a number of applications
  that enable IoT-centric forensics.

ABS: The ToR inference problem had been widely investigated in the last two decades,
  mostly using heuristic algorithms. In this problem, we attempt to reveal the economic
  relationships between ASes, data with applications in network routing management
  and routing security. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for ToR classification,
  which is based on embedding the AS numbers (ASN) in high dimensional space using
  neural networks. Similar to natural language processing (NLP) models, the embedding
  represents latent characteristics of the ASN and its interactions on the Internet.
  The embedding coordinates of each AS are represented by a vector; thus, we call
  our method BGP2VEC. In order to solve the supervised learning problem presented,
  we use these vectors as an input to an artificial neural network and achieve a state
  of the art accuracy of 95.2% for ToR classification.

ABS: Network Function Virtualization enables operators to schedule diverse network
  processing workloads on a general-purpose hardware infrastructure. However, short-lived
  processing peaks make an efficient dimensioning of processing resources under stringent
  tail latency constraints challenging. To reduce dimensioning overheads, several
  load balancing approaches, which either adaptively steer network traffic to a group
  of servers or to their internal CPU cores, have separately been investigated.In
  this paper, we present Inter-Server RSS (isRSS), a hardware mechanism built on top
  of Receive Side Scaling in the network interface card, which combines intra-and
  inter-server load balancing. In a first step, isRSS targets a balanced utilization
  of processing resources by steering packet bursts to CPU cores based on per-core
  load feedback. If all local CPU cores are highly loaded, isRSS avoids high queueing
  delays by redirecting newly arriving packet bursts to other servers, which execute
  the same network functions, exploiting that processing peaks are unlikely to occur
  at all servers at the same time. Our evaluation based on real-world network traces
  shows that compared to Receive Side Scaling, the joint intra-and inter-server load
  balancing approach is able to reduce the processing capacity dimensioned for network
  function execution by up to 38.95% and limit packet reordering to 0.0589% while
  maintaining tail latencies.

ABS: The analysis of recent large-scale cyber attacks, which leveraged insecure Internet
  of Things (IoT) devices to perform malicious activities on the Internet, highlighted
  the rise of IoT-tailored malware/botnets. These malware propagate by scanning the
  Internet for vulnerable, exploitable IoT devices that could be utilized for further
  malicious activities. In this paper, we devise a multi-level methodology to investigate
  Internet-scale reconnaissance activities generated by infected IoT devices. We leverage
  the Shodan IoT search engine and over 6TB of passive network traffic from a large
  network telescope (darknet) to infer compromised IoT devices and characterize the
  generated scanning campaigns. The results highlight a distinctive characteristic
  of IoT malware/botnets, represented by the targeted ports/services over the analysis
  interval. Furthermore, while these ports/services are mainly associated with well-known
  IoT malware/botnets (e.g., Mirai and Satori), we uncovered newly targeted ports,
  which indicate emerging IoT malware/botnet. Finally, by comparing two instances
  of analyzed IoT-generated scanning campaigns, we highlight the persistence and evolution
  of IoT malware/botnets (e.g., ADB.Miner and Fbot), which exploit existing, and in
  some cases, possibly new vulnerabilities.

GEOLOC: Cambridge, MA, US
ABS: We introduce the adaptive cuckoo filter (ACF), a data structure for approximate
  set membership that extends cuckoo filters by reacting to false positives, removing
  them for future queries. As an example application, in packet processing queries
  may correspond to flow identifiers, so a search for an element is likely to be followed
  by repeated searches for that element. Removing false positives can therefore significantly
  lower the false-positive rate. The ACF, like the cuckoo filter, uses a cuckoo hash
  table to store fingerprints. We allow fingerprint entries to be changed in response
  to a false positive in a manner designed to minimize the effect on the performance
  of the filter. We show that the ACF is able to significantly reduce the false-positive
  rate by presenting both a theoretical model for the false-positive rate and simulations
  using both synthetic data sets and real packet traces.

ABS: Data flow graphs are a popular program representation in machine learning, big
  data analytics, signal processing, and, increasingly, networking, where graph nodes
  correspond to processing primitives and graph edges describe control flow. To improve
  CPU cache locality and exploit data-level parallelism, nodes usually process data
  in batches. Unfortunately, as batches are split across dozens or hundreds of parallel
  processing pathways through the graph they tend to fragment into many small chunks,
  leading to a loss of batch efficiency. We present Batchy, a scheduler for run-to-completion
  packet processing engines, which uses controlled queuing to efficiently reconstruct
  fragmented batches in accordance with strict service-level objectives (SLOs). Batchy
  comprises a runtime profiler to quantify batch-processing gain on different processing
  functions, an analytical model to fine-tune queue backlogs, a new queuing abstraction
  to realize this model in run-to-completion execution, and a one-step receding horizon
  controller that adjusts backlogs across the pipeline. We present extensive experiments
  on five networking use cases taken from an official 5G benchmark suite to show that
  Batchy provides 2--3x the performance of prior work while accurately satisfying
  delay SLOs.

TOPKEY: passive-2012, passive-2015
ABS: In many applications, there is a need to estimate the frequency of elements.
  For example, in networking to know the number of packets of each flow. This poses
  a challenge as the number of flows and packets per second can be very large and
  therefore an exact count would require a large amount of fast memory. In those cases,
  an alternative is to use data structures, commonly referred to as sketches, that
  provide an estimate of the frequency of elements using a much smaller amount of
  memory. For example, the Count Min Sketch (CMS) hashes each element to a few counters
  and returns as estimate the minimum value among them. The CMS in general overestimates
  the frequency of an element as other elements may also map to the same counters
  and increment them. In this letter, fingerprint counting, a scheme to reduce the
  counter overestimation is presented and evaluated. The main idea is to add a fingerprint
  to the counters and use it to check if consecutive increments to a counter belong
  to the same element. When they do not, the counters can be incremented by half a
  packet instead of a full packet thus reducing the overestimation. The evaluation
  results show that the proposed scheme is able to reduce the overestimation and improve
  the CMS accuracy. In more detail, the overestimation is reduced by more than 20%
  in many of the configurations tested reaching values over 50% in some cases. A scheme
  to encode the fingerprints in the counters that practically eliminates the additional
  memory required for the fingerprints is also presented. Therefore, the improvement
  in the accuracy is achieved with a negligible impact on the size of the memory needed
  to implement the CMS.

ABS: Internet topology discovery aims at analyzing one of the most complex distributed
  systems currently deployed. Usually, it relies on measurement campaigns using hop-limited
  probes sent with traceroute. However, this probing tool comes with several limits.
  In particular, some MPLS clouds might obfuscate collected traces. The resulting
  Internet maps, their inferred properties, and the graph models are thus incomplete
  and inaccurate. In this paper, we introduce TNT (Trace the Naughty Tunnels), an
  extension to Paris traceroute for revealing, or at least detect, all MPLS tunnels
  along a path. First, along with traceroute and ping probes, TNT looks for hints
  indicating the presence of hidden tunnels. Those hints are peculiar patterns in
  the resulting output, e.g., significant TTL shifts or duplicate IP addresses. Second,
  if those hints trigger alarms, TNT launches additional dedicated probing for possibly
  revealing hidden tunnels. We use GNS3 to reproduce, verify, and understand the limits
  and capabilities of TNT in a controlled environment. We also calibrate the thresholds
  at which alarms are triggered through a dedicated measurement campaign. Finally,
  we deploy TNT on the Archipelago platform and provide a quantified classification
  of MPLS configurations. All our results, including the data, the code, and the GNS3
  experiments, are fully and publicly available.

GEOLOC: London, ON, CA
ABS: As more end devices are getting connected, the Internet will become more congested.
  A variety of congestion control techniques have been developed either on transport
  or network layers. Active Queue Management (AQM) is a paradigm that aims at mitigating
  the congestion on the network layer by active buffer control to avoid overflow.
  However, finding the right parameters for an AQM scheme is challenging, due to the
  complexity and dynamics of the networks. On the other hand, the Explicit Congestion
  Notification (ECN) mechanism is a solution that makes visible incipient congestion
  on the network layer to the transport layer. In this work, we propose to exploit
  the ECN information to improve AQM algorithms by applying Machine Learning techniques.
  Our intelligent method uses an artificial neural network to predict congestion and
  an AQM parameter tuner based on reinforcement learning. The evaluation results show
  that our solution can enhance the performance of deployed AQM, using the existing
  TCP congestion control mechanisms.

ABS: Internet in recent years has become a huge set of channels for content distribution.
  And this has highlighted limits and inefficiencies of the current protocol suite
  originally designed for host-to-host communication. This paper joins the research
  efforts addressed by the new Internet challenges by proposing a Content Name System
  (CNS) discovery service, extending the current TCP/IP hourglass Internet architecture,
  that provides a new network aware content discovery service. Contents are addressed
  using hypernames, whose rich syntax allow to specify hosts, PKI, fingerprint and
  optional logical attributes (tags) attached to the content name, such as e.g. mutable
  vs. immutable contents, digital signatures, owner, availability, price, etc. The
  CNS behavior and architecture is, partly, inspired by the Domain Name Service (DNS)
  Internet service, and whose discovery process logic uses the Border Gateway Protocol
  (BGP) information allowing Internet to route between different Autonomous Systems
  (AS). The service registers and discovers object names in each Autonomous System
  (AS), and the content discovery process is inspired to the so called valley-free
  property. In the routing among different ASes (i.e., the BGP protocol) this is a
  property that avoids un-justified AS transit costs. In our proposal this property
  allows to implement a network aware service discovery.

  detection and prevention literature, evaluation of cyber exercises, e.g., red-team

  that is flexible, applicable to all three use cases, and readily interpretable.
  In our survey of the literature we identify the distinct themes from each communitys
  evaluation procedures side by side and flesh out the drawbacks and benefits of each.
  The evaluation framework we propose includes comprehensively modeling the resource,
  labor, and attack costs in dollars incurred based on expected resource usage, accuracy
  metrics, and time. This framework is a more holistic approach in that it incorporates
  the accuracy and performance metrics, which dominate intrusion detection evaluation,
  the time to detection and impact to data and resources of an attack, favored by
  educational competitions metrics, and the monetary cost of many essential security
  components used in financial analysis. Moreover, it is flexible enough to accommodate
  each use case, easily interpretable, and comprehensive in terms of costs considered.
  Finally, we provide two examples of the framework applied to real-world use cases.
  Overall, we provide a survey and a grounded, flexible framework and multiple concrete
  examples for evaluating security that addresses the needs of three, currently distinct

ABS: The insecurity of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm continues to wreak havoc
  in consumer and critical infrastructure realms. Several challenges impede addressing
  IoT security at large, including, the lack of IoT-centric data that can be collected,
  analyzed and correlated, due to the highly heterogeneous nature of such devices
  and their widespread deployments in Internet-wide environments. To this end, this
  paper explores macroscopic, passive empirical data to shed light on this evolving
  threat phenomena. This not only aims at classifying and inferring Internet-scale
  compromised IoT devices by solely observing such one-way network traffic, but also
  endeavors to uncover, track and report on orchestrated in the wild IoT botnets.
  Initially, to prepare the effective utilization of such data, a novel probabilistic
  model is designed and developed to cleanse such traffic from noise samples (i.e.,
  misconfiguration traffic). Subsequently, several shallow and deep learning models
  are evaluated to ultimately design and develop a multi-window convolution neural
  network trained on active and passive measurements to accurately identify compromised
  IoT devices. Consequently, to infer orchestrated and unsolicited activities that
  have been generated by well-coordinated IoT botnets, hierarchical agglomerative
  clustering is deployed by scrutinizing a set of innovative and efficient network
  feature sets. By analyzing 3.6 TB of recent darknet traffic, the proposed approach
  uncovers a momentous 440,000 compromised IoT devices and generates evidence-based
  artifacts related to 350 IoT botnets. While some of these detected botnets refer
  to previously documented campaigns such as the Hide and Seek, Hajime and Fbot, other
  events illustrate evolving threats such as those with cryptojacking capabilities
  and those that are targeting industrial control system communication and control
  services.

ABS: Geometric routing, which combines greedy embedding and greedy forwarding, is
  a promising approach for efficient data sharing in darknets. However, the security
  of data sharing using geometric routing in darknets is still an issue that has not
  been fully studied. In this paper, we propose a Secure Data Sharing framework (SeDS)
  for future darknets via hierarchical greedy embedding. SeDS adopts a hierarchical
  topology and uses a set of secure nodes to protect the whole topology. To support
  geometric routing in the hierarchical topology, a two-level bit-string prefix embedding
  approach (Prefix-T) is first proposed, and then a greedy forwarding strategy and
  a data mapping approach are combined with Prefix-T for data sharing. SeDS guarantees
  that the publication or request of a data item can always pass through the corresponding
  secure node, such that security strategies can be performed. The experimental results
  show that SeDS provides scalable and efficient end-to-end communication and data
  sharing.

ABS: 'A super point is a host that interacts with a far larger number of counterparts
  in the network over a period of time. Super point detection plays an important role
  in network research and application. With the increase of network scale, distributed
  super point detection has become a hot research topic. Compared with single-node
  super point detection algorithm, the difficulty of super point detection in multi-node
  distributed environment is how to reduce communication overhead. Therefore, this
  paper proposes a three-stage communication distributed super point detection algorithm:
  Rough Estimator based Asynchronous Distributed super point detection algorithm (READ).
  READ uses a lightweight estimator, the Rough Estimator (RE), which is fast in computation
  and takes less memory to generate candidate super point. At the same time, the Linear
  Estimator (LE) is used to accurately estimate the cardinality of each candidate
  super point, so as to detect the super point correctly. In READ, each node scans
  IP address pairs asynchronously. When reaching the time window boundary, READ starts
  three-stage communication to detect the super point. In this paper, we proof that
  the accuracy of READ in distributed environment is no less than that in the single
  node environment. Four groups of 10 Gb/s and 40 Gb/s real-world high-speed network
  traffic are used to test READ. The experimental results show that READ not only
  has higher accuracy in distributed environment, but also has less than 5% of communication
  burden compared with existing algorithms.'

ABS: Researchers have studied Internet censorship for nearly as long as attempts to

  overt block pages however they are delivered. ICLab records and archives raw observations

  Within 53,906,532 measurements of individual web pages, collected by ICLab in 2017

  we compare how different blocking techniques are deployed in different regions and/or
  against different types of content. Our longitudinal monitoring pinpoints changes

  techniques discover 48 previously unknown block pages. ICLabs broad and detailed
  measurements also expose other forms of network interference, such as surveillance
  and malware injection.

ABS: Over the past decade, IXPs have been playing a key role in enabling interdomain
  connectivity. Their traffic volumes have grown dramatically and their physical presence
  has spread throughout the world. While the relevance of IXPs is undeniable, their
  long-term contribution to the shaping of the current Internet is not fully understood
  yet.  In this paper, we look into the impact on Internet routes of the intense IXP
  growth over the last decade. We observe that while in general IXPs only have a small
  effect in path shortening, very large networks do enjoy a clear IXP-enabled path
  reduction. We also observe a diversion of the routes, away from the central Tier-1
  ASes supported by IXPs. Interestingly, we also find that whereas IXP membership
  has grown, large and central ASes have steadily moved away from public IXP peerings,
  whereas smaller ones have embraced them. Despite all these changes, we find though
  that a clear hierarchy remains, with a small group of highly central networks

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are a big problem in the current
  digital landscape. Many research is conducted on various sub parts of DDoS. However,
  little is known about the infrastructure behind the attacks. It can be of interest
  to know how attacker choose their infrastructure. It is possible that they choose
  their attacking nodes very specific based on some characteristics. This paper aims
  to characterize the infrastructure of a DDoS attack to gain more insights in the
  infrastructures and how attackers choose their attacking nodes. The paper will focus
  on seven different attack types and will analyze their infrastructure. We will show
  that DNS recursion is still enabled on a lot of DNS resolvers, that the non-RFC-compliant
  implementation of Chargen in Windows is widely misused and that small ISPs are the
  most common in DDoS attacks attacking nodes.

ABS: Internet topology discovery has been a recurrent research topic for nearly 20
  years now. Usually, it works by sending hop-limited probes (i.e., traceroute) towards
  a set of destinations to collect topological data in order to infer the Internet
  topology at a given scale (e.g., at the router or the AS level). However, traceroute
  comes with multiple limitations, in particular with layer-2 clouds such as MPLS
  that might hide their content to traceroute exploration. Thus, the resulting Internet
  topology data and models are incomplete and inaccurate. In this paper, we introduce
  TNT (Trace the Naughty Tunnels), an extension to Paris traceroute for revealing
  most (if not all) MPLS tunnels along a path. TNT works in two basic stages. First,
  along with traceroute probes, it looks for evidences of the potential presence of
  hidden tunnels. Those evidences are surprising patterns in the traceroute output,
  e.g., abrupt and significant TTL shifts. Second, if alarms are triggered due to
  the presence of such evidences, TNT launches additional and dedicated probing for
  possibly revealing the content of the hidden tunnel. We validate TNT through emulation
  with GNS3 and tune its parameters through a dedicated measurement campaign. We also
  largely deploy TNT on the Archipelago platform and provide a quantification of tunnels,
  updating so the state of the art vision of MPLS tunnels. Finally, TNT and its validation
  platform are fully and publicly available, as well as the collected data and scripts
  used for processing data.

ABS: Networks (Autonomous Systems-AS) allocate or revoke IP prefixes with the intervention
  of official Internet resource number authorities, and select and advertise policy-compliant
  paths towards these prefixes using the inter-domain routing system and its primary

  of several research and industrial efforts during the last decades, that have culminated
  in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) for the cryptographic verification
  of prefix-to-AS assignments. However, there is still no widely adopted solution
  for securing IP prefixes and the (AS-)paths leading to them; approaches such as
  BGPsec have seen minuscule deployment. In this work, we design and implement a Blockchain-based
  system that (i) can be used to validate both of these resource types, (ii) can work
  passively and does not require any changes in the inter-domain routing system (BGP,

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack has become one of the most destructive
  network attacks which can pose a mortal threat to Internet security. Existing detection
  methods can not effectively detect early attacks. In this paper, we propose a detection
  method of DDoS attacks based on generalized multiple kernel learning (GMKL) combining
  with the constructed parameter R. The super-fusion feature value (SFV) and comprehensive
  degree of feature (CDF) are defined to describe the characteristic of attack flow
  and normal flow. A method for calculating R based on SFV and CDF is proposed to
  select the combination of kernel function and regularization paradigm. A DDoS attack
  detection classifier is generated by using the trained GMKL model with R parameter.
  The experimental results show that kernel function and regularization parameter
  selection method based on R parameter reduce the randomness of parameter selection
  and the error of model detection, and the proposed method can effectively detect
  DDoS attacks in complex environments with higher detection rate and lower error
  rate.

ABS: As time evolves, communities in a social network may undergo various changes
  known as critical events. For instance, a community can either split into several
  other communities, expand into a larger community, shrink to a smaller community,
  remain stable or merge into another community. Prediction of critical events has
  attracted increasing attention in the recent literature. Learning the evolution
  of communities over time is a key step towards predicting the critical events the
  communities may undergo. This is an important and difficult issue in the study of
  social networks. In the work to date, there is a lack of formal approaches for modeling
  and predicting critical events over time. This motivates our effort to design a
  new statistical method for event prediction in order to make better use of histories
  of past changes. To this end, this paper proposes a sliding window analysis from
  which we develop a model that simultaneously exploits an autoregressive model and
  survival analysis techniques. The autoregressive model is employed here to simulate
  the evolution of the community structure, whereas the survival analysis techniques
  allow the prediction of future changes the community may undergo.

ABS: Approximating quantiles and distributions over streaming data has been studied
  for roughly two decades now. Recently, Karnin, Lang, and Liberty proposed the first
  asymptotically optimal algorithm for doing so. This manuscript complements their
  theoretical result by providing a practical variants of their algorithm with improved
  constants. For a given sketch size, our techniques provably reduce the upper bound
  on the sketch error by a factor of two. These improvements are verified experimentally.
  Our modified quantile sketch improves the latency as well by reducing the worst
  case update time from O(1/epsilon) down to O(log(1/epsilon)). We also suggest two
  algorithms for weighted item streams which offer improved asymptotic update times
  compared to naive extensions. Finally, we provide a specialized data structure for
  these sketches which reduces both their memory footprints and update times.

ABS: Presently in the technological era, Internet is the sole medium to access and
  run web based services such as a business, banking, education, e-commerce, weather
  forecasting, etc. Because of the increasing usage of such services and dependency
  on the Internet, many types of malware threats have emerged over the time that affects
  the timely delivery of these services. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack
  is one of such crucial threats. Many researchers have proposed diversified DDoS
  detection approaches using information theory based entropy and divergence detection
  metrics in the past. This paper proposes to use a novel LeCam divergence metric
  to detect different types of DDoS attacks based on flow similarity between the network
  traffic flows. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is corroborated using
  widely used benchmarked MIT Lincoln and CAIDA datasets along with DDoSTB dataset.
  The results show that the novel LeCam Divergence metric is more effective as compared
  to the traditional Kullbeck-Leibler, Bhattacharyya and Pearson Divergence measures.

ABS: DNS is a distributed, fault tolerant system that avoids a single point of failure.
  As such it is an integral part of the internet as we use it today and hence deemed
  a safe protocol which is let through firewalls and proxies with no or little checks.
  This can be exploited by malicious agents. Network forensics is effective but struggles
  due to size of data and manual labour. This paper explores to what extent predictive
  models can be used to predict network traffic, what protocols are tunneled in the
  DNS protocol and more specifically whether the predictive performance is enhanced
  when analyzing DNS-queries and responses together and which feature set that can
  be used for DNS-tunneled network prediction. The tested protocols are SSH, SFTP
  and Telnet and the machine learning models used are Multi Layered Perceptron and
  Random Forests. To train the models we extract the IP Packet length, Name length
  and Name entropy of both the queries and responses in the DNS traffic. With an experimental
  research strategy it is empirically shown that the performance of the models increases
  when training the models on the query and respose pairs rather than using only queries
  or responses. The accuracy of the models is >83% and reduction in data size when
  features are extracted is roughly 95%. Our results provides evidence that machine
  learning is a valuable tool in detecting network protocols in a DNS tunnel and that
  only an small subset of network traffic is needed to detect this anomaly.

ABS: Emerging network scenarios are characterized by intensive access to a wide range
  of services and applications that have increased the demands of communication networks.
  The traditional network management models have been characterized by a high dependence
  on the human factor to carry out network configuration and maintenance tasks. This
  situation has become less sustainable in mobile networks not only due to the associated
  operational (COPEX) and capital investment costs (CAPEX), but also due to the complexity
  they have acquired when facing the exponential immersion of mobile devices. These
  aspects have led to the emergence of the fifth generation of mobile networks, characterized
  by ambitious performance indicators that must be fulfilled to meet the agreed service
  levels. 5G networks are grounded on the integration of technological advances promoted
  by Software Defined Networks (SDN), Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), artificial
  intelligence, among others, that have shifted the traditional network management
  paradigms towards a self-organized and software-driven approach. It is therefore
  essential to develop analytical methods based on artificial intelligence techniques
  to obtain knowledge about the state of the network in order to infer possible situations
  that might put the operativity of the network at risk. To this end, this research
  focuses on the study of knowledge acquisition methods aimed to introduce self-organization
  capabilities in 5G networks. It should be also noted that this thesis has been framed
  in the SELFNET project (Framework for Self-organized Network Management in Virtualized
  and Software Defined Networks) funded by the Horizon 2020 program of the European
  Commission, whose purpose is the design and implementation of an autonomic management
  framework for 5G networks. As a result, SELFNET has provided a reference architecture
  for the development of the proposals conducted as part of this research. This thesis
  also provides a review of the state of the art in 5G networks and their supportive
  technologies. Likewise, diverse prediction and pattern recognition methods have
  been studied in detail in order to conduct analytical processes focused on the acquisition
  of knowledge about the monitored networks. The performed research proposed also
  an analytical framework oriented to the acquisition of knowledge in emerging network
  scenarios based on the architectural principles described above. The evaluation
  of such proposal has shown its effectiveness in view of the results obtained in
  the experimentation stage. This evaluation has been conducted both at individual
  component level and at use case level. On the other hand, detection methods for
  two major threats have been studied from the perspective of emerging communication
  scenarios. The first of them focuses on the detection of Economic Denial of Sustainability
  (EDoS) attacks in cloud computing environments. This approach has been based on
  the study of anomalous behaviors of the entropy degree measured on application-level
  metrics. The effectiveness of the proposal has led to its study in self-organized
  network scenarios, where it has been also demonstrated acceptable levels of precision
  in the light of the results. The second detection method has focused on inferring
  the participation of a network device in a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
  attack. The proposed model has been based on the knowledge acquisition principles
  established as part of this research, demonstrating also acceptable levels of accuracy
  in the evaluated experimental scenarios. Finally, the conducted research has opened
  interesting lines of future work described at the end of this thesis.

ABS: We present the Maestro attack, a novel Link Flooding Attack (LFA) that leverages
  control-plane traffic engineering techniques to concentrate botnet-sourced Distributed
  Denial of Service flows on transit links. Executed from a compromised or malicious
  Autonomous System (AS), Maestro advertises specific-prefix routes poisoned for selected
  ASes to collapse inbound traffic paths onto a single target link. A greedy heuristic
  fed by publicly available AS relationship data iteratively builds the set of ASes
  to poison. Given a compromised BGP speaker with advantageous positioning relative
  to the target link in the Internet topology, an adversary can expect to enhance
  total flow density by more than 30%. For a large botnet (e.g., Mirai), that translates
  to augmenting a DDoS by more than a million additional infected hosts. Interestingly,
  the size of the adversary-controlled AS plays little role in this amplification
  effect. Devastating attacks on core links can be executed by small, resource-limited
  ASes. To understand the scope of the attack, we evaluate widespread Internet link
  vulnerability across several metrics, including BGP betweenness and botnet flow
  density. We then assess where an adversary must be positioned to execute the attack
  most successfully. Finally, we present effective mitigations for network operators
  seeking to insulate themselves from this attack.

  examine both the entire geographic topology of the Internet and a subset of the
  topology that a Tor user would typically interact with. We find that 44% of paths
  across the entire geographic topology of the Internet and 33% of paths in the user
  experience subset unnecessarily expose traffic to one or more nations. Finally,
  we consider the scenario where countries exercise both legal and physical control
  over autonomous systems, gaining access to traffic outside of their geographic borders,
  but carried by organizations that fall under the ASs registered countrys legal jurisdiction.
  At least 49% of paths in both measurements expose traffic to a geographically irrelevant
  country when considering both the physical and legal countries that a path traverses.

  attracted significant attention from the research community. To this end, several
  surveys were put forward addressing various IoT-centric topics, including intrusion

  paper, we exclusively focus on the ever-evolving IoT vulnerabilities. In this context,
  we initially provide a comprehensive classification of state-of-the-art surveys,
  which address various dimensions of the IoT paradigm. This aims at facilitating
  IoT research endeavors by amalgamating, comparing, and contrasting dispersed research
  contributions. Subsequently, we provide a unique taxonomy, which sheds the light
  on IoT vulnerabilities, their attack vectors, impacts on numerous security objectives,
  attacks which exploit such vulnerabilities, corresponding remediation methodologies
  and currently offered operational cyber security capabilities to infer and monitor
  such weaknesses. This aims at providing the reader with a multidimensional research
  perspective related to IoT vulnerabilities, including their technical details and
  consequences, which is postulated to be leveraged for remediation objectives. Additionally,
  motivated by the lack of empirical (and malicious) data related to the IoT paradigm,
  this paper also presents a first look on Internet-scale IoT exploitations by drawing
  upon more than 1.2 GB of macroscopic, passive measurements data. This aims at practically
  highlighting the severity of the IoT problem, while providing operational situational
  awareness capabilities, which undoubtedly would aid in the mitigation task, at large.
  Insightful findings, inferences and outcomes in addition to open challenges and
  research problems are also disclosed in this paper, which we hope would pave the
  way for future research endeavors addressing theoretical and empirical aspects related
  to the imperative topic of IoT security.

  from January 2007 to June 2017, we collect more than 51 million mal-activity reports
  involving 662K unique IP addresses worldwide. Leveraging the Wayback Machine, antivirus
  (AV) tool reports and several additional public datasets (e.g., BGP Route Views
  and Internet registries) we enrich the data with historical meta-information including
  geo-locations (countries), autonomous system (AS) numbers and types of mal-activity.
  Furthermore, we use the initially labelled dataset of approx 1.57 million mal-activities
  (obtained from public blacklists) to train a machine learning classifier to classify
  the remaining unlabeled dataset of approx 44 million mal-activities obtained through
  additional sources. We make our unique collected dataset (and scripts used) publicly
  available for further research. The main contributions of the paper are a novel
  means of report collection, with a machine learning approach to classify reported
  activities, characterization of the dataset and, most importantly, temporal analysis
  of mal-activity reporting behavior. Inspired by P2P behavior modeling, our analysis
  shows that some classes of mal-activities (e.g., phishing) and a small number of
  mal-activity sources are persistent, suggesting that either blacklist-based prevention
  systems are ineffective or have unreasonably long update periods. Our analysis also
  indicates that resources can be better utilized by focusing on heavy mal-activity
  contributors, which constitute the bulk of mal-activities.

ABS: The recent advancements in computing and sensor technologies, coupled with improvements
  in embedded system design methodologies, have resulted in the novel paradigm called
  the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is essentially a network of small embedded devices
  enabled with sensing capabilities that can interact with multiple entities to relay
  information about their environments. This sensing information can also be stored
  in the cloud for further analysis, thereby reducing storage requirements on the
  devices themselves. The above factors, coupled with the ever increasing needs of
  modern society to stay connected at all times, has resulted in IoT technology penetrating
  all facets of modern life. In fact IoT systems are already seeing widespread applications
  across multiple industries such as transport, utility, manufacturing, healthcare,
  home automation, etc. Although the above developments promise tremendous benefits
  in terms of productivity and efficiency, they also bring forth a plethora of security
  challenges. Namely, the current design philosophy of IoT devices, which focuses
  more on rapid prototyping and usability, results in security often being an afterthought.
  Furthermore, one needs to remember that unlike traditional computing systems, these
  devices operate under the assumption of tight resource constraints. As such this
  makes IoT devices a lucrative target for exploitation by adversaries. This inherent
  flaw of IoT setups has manifested itself in the form of various distributed denial
  of service (DDoS) attacks that have achieved massive throughputs without the need
  for techniques such as amplification, etc. Furthermore, once exploited, an IoT device
  can also function as a pivot point for adversaries to move laterally across the
  network and exploit other, potentially more valuable, systems and services. Finally,
  vulnerable IoT devices operating in industrial control systems and other critical
  infrastructure setups can cause sizable loss of property and in some cases even
  lives, a very sobering fact. In light of the above, this dissertation research presents
  several novel strategies for identifying known and zero-day attacks against IoT
  devices, as well as identifying infected IoT devices present inside a network along
  with some mitigation strategies. To this end, network telescopes are leveraged to
  generate Internet-scale notions of maliciousness in conjunction with signatures
  that can be used to identify such devices in a network. This strategy is further
  extended by developing a taxonomy-based methodology which is capable of categorizing
  unsolicited IoT behavior by leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques, such as
  ensemble learners, to identify similar threats in near-real time. Furthermore, to
  overcome the challenge of insufficient (malicious) training data within the IoT
  realm, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based framework is also developed
  to identify known and unseen attacks on IoT devices. Finally, a software defined
  networking (SDN) based solution is proposed to mitigate threats from unsolicited
  IoT devices.

ABS: Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack becomes a rapidly growing problem
  with the fast development of the Internet. The existing DDoS attack detection methods
  have time-delay and low detection rate. This paper presents a DDoS attack detection
  method based on network abnormal behavior in a big data environment. Based on the
  characteristics of flood attack, the method filters the network flows to leave only
  the many-to-one network flows to reduce the interference from normal network flows
  and improve the detection accuracy. We define the network abnormal feature value
  (NAFV) to reflect the state changes of the old and new IP address of many-to-one
  network flows. Finally, the DDoS attack detection method based on NAFV real-time
  series is built to identify the abnormal network flow states caused by DDoS attacks.
  The experiments show that compared with similar methods, this method has higher
  detection rate, lower false alarm rate and missing rate.

ABS: 'Cardinality estimation algorithms receive a stream of elements, with possible
  repetitions, and return the number of distinct elements in the stream. Such algorithms
  seek to minimize the required memory and CPU resource consumption at the price of
  inaccuracy in their output. In computer networks, cardinality estimation algorithms
  are mainly used for counting the number of distinct flows, and they are divided
  into two categories: sketching algorithms and sampling algorithms. Sketching algorithms
  require the processing of all packets, and they are therefore usually implemented
  by dedicated hardware. Sampling algorithms do not require processing of all packets,
  but they are known for their inaccuracy. In this work we identify one of the major
  drawbacks of sampling-based cardinality estimation algorithms: their inability to
  adapt to changes in flow size distribution. To address this problem, we propose
  a new sampling-based adaptive cardinality estimation framework, which uses online
  machine learning. We evaluate our framework using real traffic traces, and show
  significantly better accuracy compared to the best known sampling-based algorithms,
  for the same fraction of processed packets.'

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks remain a major threat in cybersecurity.
  Although extensive research has been conducted to detect and prevent DDoS attacks,
  industry still lacks effective tools and mechanism to achieve that goal. This is
  mainly due to the mutating (changing) nature of these attacks, as well as the development
  of new techniques used by the perpetrators of these acts. Traditional methods of
  dealing with DDoS attacks have proven to be deficient and inefficient in accurately
  detecting these attacks as most of those techniques were able to classify and detect
  only known classes of attacks. Therefore, successful identification of these attacks
  in their early stages is the utmost priority which is yet to be accomplished with
  all other detection techniques. This thesis addresses some of the challenges of
  detecting DDoS attacks on a real-time basis. A multifractal approach has been proposed
  for better and timely detection of DDoS attacks. The approach is based on measuring
  the complexity of the traffic self-affinity .The detection performance of this technique
  is compared with their traditional detection mechanisms, and an improvement in performance
  is reported in terms of time, computational speed, memory or resource usage and
  accuracy. The evaluation of the limitations of the traditional methods against multifractal
  approach is also considered. The use of multifractal analysis in detecting DDoS
  attacks provides an improvement compared to other techniques as a result of the
  multiscale complexity measures. Since this multiscale relationship exists in the
  Internet traffic of packets, anomalies can be detected on increasing time scales.
  This makes it possible to detect the presence of such attacks in the Internet traffic,
  an important feature that is missing in other current alternative detection techniques.

ABS: We study how the graph structure of the Internet at the Autonomous Systems (AS)
  level evolved during a decade. For each year of the period 2008-2017 we consider
  a snapshot of the AS graph and examine how many features related to structure, connectivity
  and centrality changed over time. The analysis of these metrics provides topological
  and data traffic information and allows to clarify some assumptions about the models
  concerning the evolution of the Internet graph structure. We find that the size
  of the Internet roughly doubled. The overall trend of the average connectivity is
  an increase over time, while that of the shortest path length is a decrease over
  time. The internal core of the Internet is composed of a small fraction of big AS
  and is more stable and connected that external cores. A hierarchical organization
  emerges where a small fraction of big hubs are connected to many regions with high
  internal cohesiveness, poorly connected among them and containing AS with low and
  medium number of links. Centrality measurements indicate that the average number
  of shortest paths crossing an AS or containing a link between two of them decreased
  over time.

ABS: 'The Internet is a gigantic distributed system where the end-to-end (E2E) quality-of-service
  (QoS) plays an important role. Yet the current inter-domain routing protocol, namely,
  the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), cannot provide E2E QoS guarantees. The main reason
  is that an autonomous system (AS) can only receive guarantees from its first-hop
  ASes via service level agreements (SLAs). But beyond the first-hop, QoS along the
  path from a source AS to a destination AS is not within the source ASs control regime.
  This makes it difficult to provide high quality-of-experience services to many Internet
  users even when many content providers are willing to pay for such high quality
  E2E guarantees. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of providing high
  QoS-guaranteed E2E transit services by utilizing a (small) set of ASes/IXPs to serve
  as brokers to provide supervision, control and resource negotiation. Finding an
  optimal set of ASes as brokers can be formulated as a Maximum Coverage with Bdominating
  path Guarantee (MCBG) problem, and we show that it is in fact NP-hard. To address
  this problem, we design an approximation algorithm and also an efficient heuristic
  algorithm when additional constraints (e.g., the path length) are considered. We
  further analyze the APX-hardness of the MCBG problem to reveal the existence of
  the best approximation ratio. Based on the current Internet topology, we demonstrate
  that it is indeed feasible to provide high QoS guarantees for most E2E connections
  with only a small broker set: with only 0.19, 1.9 or 6.8 percent ASes/IXPs serving
  as brokers, 53.13, 85.41 or 99.29 percent of all global E2E connections can receive
  high QoS-guaranteed services. Finally, we provide an economic model to study the
  behaviours of ASes when cooperating our brokerage scheme with the BGP protocol,
  and show that there are incentives to form and maintain such a brokerage coalition.'

ABS: This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of a system to implement
  complex congestion control functions by placing them in a separate agent outside
  the datapath. Each datapath-such as the Linux kernel TCP, UDP-based QUIC, or kernel-bypass
  transports like mTCP-on-DPDK-summarizes information about packet round-trip times,
  receptions, losses, and ECN via a well-defined interface to algorithms running in
  the off-datapath Congestion Control Plane (CCP). The algorithms use this information
  to control the datapaths congestion window or pacing rate. Algorithms written in
  CCP can run on multiple datapaths. CCP improves both the pace of development and
  ease of maintenance of congestion control algorithms by providing better, modular
  abstractions, and supports aggregation capabilities of the Congestion Manager, all
  with one-time changes to datapaths. CCP also enables new capabilities, such as Copa
  in Linux TCP, several algorithms running on QUIC and mTCP/DPDK, and the use of signal
  processing algorithms to detect whether cross-traffic is ACK-clocked. Experiments
  with our user-level Linux CCP implementation show that CCP algorithms behave similarly
  to kernel algorithms, and incur modest CPU overhead of a few percent.

TOPKEY: passive-2016, passive-2018
GEOLOC: Delft, NL
ABS: The ability to detect, in real-time, heavy hitters is beneficial to many network
  applications, such as DoS and anomaly detection. Through programmable languages
  as P4, heavy hitter detection can be implemented directly in the data-plane, allowing
  custom actions to be applied to packets as they are processed at a network node.
  This enables networks to immediately respond to changes in network traffic in the
  data-plane itself and allows for different QoS profiles for heavy hitter and non-heavy
  hitter traffic. Current interval-based methods that flush the whole counting structure
  are not well-suited for programmable hardware (the data-plane), because they either
  require more resources than available in that hardware, they do not provide good
  accuracy, or require too many actions from the control-plane. A sliding window approach
  that maintains accuracy over time would solve these issues. However, to the best
  of our knowledge, the concept of sliding windows in programmable hardware has not
  been studied yet. In this paper, we develop streaming approaches to detect heavy
  hitters in the data-plane. We consider the problems of (1) adopting a sliding window
  and (2) identifying heavy hitters separately and propose multiple memory- and processing-efficient
  solutions for each of them. These solutions are suitable for P4 programmable hardware
  and can be combined at will to solve the streaming variant of the heavy hitter detection
  problem.

ABS: Industrial control systems (ICS) are managed remotely with the help of dedicated
  protocols that were originally designed to work in walled gardens. Many of these
  protocols have been adapted to Internet transport and support wide-area communication.
  ICS now exchange insecure traffic on an inter-domain level, putting at risk not
  only common critical infrastructure, but also the Internet ecosystem (e.g., DRDoS
  attacks). In this paper, we uncover unprotected inter-domain ICS traffic at two
  central Internet vantage points, an IXP and an ISP. This traffic analysis is correlated
  with data from honeypots and Internet-wide scans to separate industrial from non-industrial
  ICS traffic. We provide an in-depth view on Internet-wide ICS communication. Our
  results can be used (1) to create precise filters for potentially harmful non-industrial
  ICS traffic, and (2) to detect ICS sending unprotected inter-domain ICS traffic,
  being vulnerable to eavesdropping and traffic manipulation attacks.

TOPKEY: topology-as-relationships,  ixps
GEOLOC: Singapore, SG
ABS: In light of ever-increasing scale and sophistication of modern DDoS attacks,
  it is time to revisit in-network filtering or the idea of empowering DDoS victims
  to install in-network traffic filters in the upstream transit networks. Recent proposals
  show that filtering DDoS traffic at a handful of large transit networks can handle
  volumetric DDoS attacks effectively. However, the innetwork filtering primitive
  can also be misused. Transit networks can use the in-network filtering service as
  an excuse for any arbitrary packet drops made for their own benefit. For example,
  transit networks may intentionally execute filtering services poorly or unfairly
  to discriminate their competing neighbor ASes while claiming that they drop packets
  for the sake of DDoS defense. We argue that it is due to the lack of verifiable
  filtering - i.e., no one can check if a transit network executes the filter rules
  correctly as requested by the DDoS victims. To make in-network filtering a more
  robust defense primitive, in this paper, we propose a verifiable in-network filtering,
  called VIF, that exploits emerging hardware-based trusted execution environments
  (TEEs) and offers filtering verifiability to DDoS victims and neighbor ASes. Our
  proof of concept demonstrates that a VIF filter implementation on commodity servers
  with TEE support can handle traffic at line rate (e.g., 10 Gb/s) and execute up
  to 3,000 filter rules. We show that VIF can easily scale to handle larger traffic
  volume (e.g., 500 Gb/s) and more complex filtering operations (e.g., 150,000 filter
  rules) by parallelizing the TEE-based filters. As a practical deployment model,
  we suggest that Internet exchange points (IXPs) are the ideal candidates for the
  early adopters of our verifiable filters due to their central locations and flexible
  software-defined architecture.

  problems that are not well understood, though performance is understood to be a

  well as along the entire end-to-end Tor path and find that congestion occurs almost
  exclusively in egress kernel socket buffers. We then analyze Tors socket interactions
  and discover two major contributors to Tors congestion: Tor writes sockets sequentially,
  and Tor writes as much as possible to each socket. To improve Tors performance,
  we design, implement, and test KIST: a new socket management algorithm that uses
  real-time kernel information to dynamically compute the amount to write to each
  socket while considering all circuits of all writable sockets when scheduling cells.
  We find that, in the medians, KIST reduces circuit congestion by more than 30%,
  reduces network latency by 18%, and increases network throughput by nearly 10%.
  We also find that client and relay performance with KIST improves as more relays
  deploy it and as network load and packet loss rates increase. We analyze the security
  of KIST and find an acceptable performance and security tradeoff, as it does not
  significantly affect the outcome of well-known latency, throughput, and traffic
  correlation attacks. KIST has been merged and configured as the default socket scheduling
  algorithm in Tor version 0.3.2.1-alpha (released September 18, 2017) and became

ABS: "In Internet mapping, IP address space is divided into a set of client aggregation
  units, which are the finest-grained units for global load balancing. Choosing the
  proper level of aggregation is a complex problem, which determines the number of
  aggregation units that a mapping system has to maintain and client redirection.
  In this paper, using Internet-wide measurements provided by a commercial global
  load balancing service provider, we show that even for the best existing client
  aggregation, almost 17% of clients have latency more than 50 ms apart from the average
  latency of clients in the same aggregation unit. To address this, we propose a data-driven
  client aggregation, AP-atoms, which can trade off scalability for accuracy and adapt
  for changing network conditions. Since AP-atoms are obtained from the passive measurements
  of existing traffic between server providers and clients, no extra measurement overheads
  are incurred. Our experiments show that by using the same scale of client aggregations,
  AP-atoms can reduce the number of widely dispersed clients by almost $2\times $

ABS: Host cardinality is one of the important attributes in the field of network research.
  The cardinality estimation under sliding time window has become a research hotspot
  in recent years because of its high accuracy and small delay. This kind of algorithms
  preserve the time information of sliding time window by introducing more powerful
  counters. The more counters used in these algorithms, the higher the estimation
  accuracy of these algorithms. However, the available number of sliding counters
  is limited due to their large memory footprint or long state-maintenance time. To
  solve this problem, a new sliding counter, asynchronous timestamp (AT), is designed
  in this paper which has the advantages of less memory consumption and low state-maintenance
  time. AT can replace counters in existing algorithms. On the same device, more AT
  can be used to achieve higher accuracy. Based on AT, this paper designs a new multi-hosts
  cardinalities estimation algorithm VATE. VATE is also a parallel algorithm that
  can be deployed on GPU. With the parallel processing capability of GPU, VATE can
  estimate cardinalities of hosts in a 40 Gb/s high-speed network in real time at
  the time granularity of 1 second.

ABS: Collecting flow records is a common practice of network operators and researchers
  for monitoring, diagnosing and understanding a network. Traditional tools like NetFlow
  face great challenges when both the speed and the complexity of the network traffic
  increase. To keep pace up, we propose HashFlow, a tool for more efficient and accurate
  collection and analysis of flow records. The central idea of HashFlow is to maintain
  accurate records for elephant flows, but summarized records for mice flows, by applying
  a novel collision resolution and record promotion strategy to hash tables. The performance
  bound can be analyzed with a probabilistic model, and with this strategy, HashFlow
  achieves a better utilization of space, and also more accurate flow records, without
  bringing extra complexity. We have implemented HashFlow, as well as several latest
  flow measurement algorithms such as FlowRadar, HashPipe and ElasticSketch, in a
  P4 software switch. Then we use traces from different operational networks to evaluate
  them. In these experiments, for various types of traffic analysis applications,
  HashFlow consistently demonstrates a clearly better performance against its state-of-the-art
  competitors. For example, using a small memory of 1 MB, HashFlow can accurately
  record around 55K flows, which is often 12.5% higher than the others. For estimating
  the sizes of 50K flows, HashFlow achieves a relative error of around 11.6%, while
  the estimation error of the best competitor is 42.9% higher. It detects 96.1% of
  the heavy hitters out of 250K flows with a size estimation error of 5.6%, which
  is 11.3% and 73.7% better than the best competitor respectively. At last, we show
  these merits of HashFlow come with almost no degradation of throughput.

  specific to each researcher. Results are difficult to compare, and global, historical
  perspectives are rare. Because each group maintains their own software, erroneous
  methods may continue to be used long after the error has been discovered. Because
  censors continually update their equipment and blacklists, it may be impossible
  to reproduce historical results even with the same vantage points and testing software.
  Because probe lists of potentially censored material are labor-intensive to compile,
  requiring an understanding of the politics and culture of each country studied,
  researchers discover only the most obvious and long-lasting cases of censorship.
  In this dissertation I will show that it is possible to make progress toward addressing
  all of these problems at once. I will present a proof-of concept monitoring system
  designed to operate continuously, in as many different countries as possible, using
  the best known techniques for detection and analysis. I will also demonstrate improved
  techniques for verifying the geographic location of a monitoring vantage point;
  for distinguishing innocuous network problems from censorship and other malicious
  network interference; and for discovering new web pages that are closely related
  to known-censored pages. These techniques improve the accuracy of a continuous monitoring
  system and reduce the manual labor required to operate it. This research has, in
  addition, already led to new discoveries. For example, I have confirmed reports
  that a commonly-used heuristic is too sensitive and will mischaracterize a wide
  variety of unrelated problems as censorship. I have been able to identify a few
  cases of political censorship within a much longer list of cases of moralizing censorship.
  I have expanded small seed groups of politically sensitive documents into larger
  groups of documents to test for censorship. Finally, I can also detect other forms
  of network interference with a totalitarian motive, such as injection of surveillance
  scripts. In summary, this work demonstrates that mostly-automated measurements of
  Internet censorship on a worldwide scale are feasible, and that the elusive global
  and historical perspective is within reach. '

ABS: Open proxies forward traffic on behalf of any Internet user. Listed on open proxy
  aggregator sites, they are often used to bypass geographic region restrictions or
  circumvent censorship. Open proxies sometimes also provide a weak form of anonymity
  by concealing the requestors IP address. To better understand their behavior and
  performance, we conducted a comprehensive study of open proxies, encompassing more
  than 107,000 listed open proxies and 13M proxy requests over a 50 day period. While
  previous studies have focused on malicious open proxies manipulation of HTML content
  to insert/modify ads, we provide a more broad study that examines the availability,
  success rates, diversity, and also (mis)behavior of proxies. Our results show that
  listed open proxies suer poor availability-more than 92% of open proxies that appear
  on aggregator sites are unresponsive to proxy requests. Much more troubling, we
  nd numerous examples of malicious open proxies in which HTML content is manipulated
  to mine cryptocurrency (that is, cryptojacking). We additionally detect TLS manin-the-middle
  (MitM) attacks, and discover numerous instances in which binaries fetched through
  proxies were modified to include remote access trojans and other forms of malware.
  As a point of comparison, we conduct and discuss a similar measurement study of
  the behavior of Tor exit relays. We nd no instances in which Tor relays performed
  TLS MitM or manipulated content, suggesting that Tor oers a far more reliable and
  safe form of proxied communication.

ABS: Volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks can bring any network
  to a halt. Because of their distributed nature and high volume, the victim often
  cannot handle these attacks alone and needs help from upstream ISPs. Todays Internet
  has no automated mechanism for victims to ask ISPs for help in attack handling and
  ISPs themselves do not offer such services. We propose SENSS, a security service
  for collaborative mitigation of volumetric DDoS attacks. SENSS enables the victim
  of an attack to request attack monitoring and filtering on demand, and to pay for
  the services rendered. Requests can be sent both to the immediate and to remote
  ISPs, in an automated and secure manner, and can be authenticated by these ISPs,
  without having prior trust with the victim. Simple and generic SENSS APIs enable
  victims to build custom detection and mitigation approaches against a variety of
  DDoS attacks. SENSS is deployable with todays infrastructure, and it has strong
  economic incentives both for ISPs and for the attack victims. It is also very effective
  in sparse deployment, offering full protection to direct customers of early adopters,
  and considerable protection to remote victims when deployed strategically. Deployment
  on the largest 1% of ISPs protects not just direct customers of these ISPs, but
  everyone on the Internet, from 90% of volumetric DDoS attacks.

ABS: 'Researchers in many disciplines have previously used a variety of mathematical
  techniques for analyzing group interactions. Here we use a new metric for this purpose,
  called integrated information or phi. Phi was originally developed by neuroscientists
  as a measure of consciousness in brains, but it captures, in a single mathematical
  quantity, two properties that are important in many other kinds of groups as well:
  differentiated information and integration. Here we apply this metric to the activity
  of three types of groups that involve people and computers. First, we find that
  4-person work groups with higher measured phi perform a wide range of tasks more
  effectively, as measured by their collective intelligence. Next, we find that groups
  of Wikipedia editors with higher measured phi create higher quality articles. Last,
  we find that the measured phi of the collection of people and computers communicating
  on the Internet increased over a recent six-year period. Together, these results
  suggest that integrated information can be a useful way of characterizing a certain
  kind of interactional complexity that, at least sometimes, predicts group performance.
  In this sense, phi can be viewed as a potential metric of effective group collaboration.'

ABS: Multi-domain network resource reservation systems are being deployed, driven
  by the demand and substantial benefits of providing predictable network resources.
  However, a major lack of existing systems is their coarse granularity, due to the
  participating networks concern of revealing sensitive information, which can result
  in substantial inefficiencies. This paper presents Mercator, a novel multi-domain
  network resource discovery system to provide fine-grained, global network resource
  information, for collaborative sciences. The foundation of Mercator is a resource
  abstraction through algebraic-expression enumeration (i.e., linear inequalities/equations),
  as a compact representation of the available bandwidth in multi-domain networks.
  In addition, we develop an obfuscating protocol, to address the privacy concerns
  by ensuring that no participant can associate the algebraic expressions with the
  corresponding member networks. We also introduce a super-set projection technique
  to increase Mercators scalability. Finally, we implement Mercator and demonstrate
  both its efficiency and efficacy through extensive experiments using real topologies
  and traces.

ABS: 'Sometimes, in order to answer the questions that we ask as researchers, we need
  to combine more than one way of thinking about our questions. In situations when
  our objects of inquiry-the things in the world we question-are made up of some mixture
  of people, processes, and/or systems, we may find unusual juxtapositions of research
  methods particularly useful for discerning the important issues at stake. In these
  cases, our research benefits from the flexibility and breadth that we can bring
  to the ways that we ask, and answer, our research questions. When we embrace this
  methodological diversity, we can decide how important it is for our approach to
  be replicable, our results reproducible, or our argument intuitive, and we can select
  a set of specific techniques and methods that ft these priorities. For example,
  to examine how public policy and physical infrastructure affect large-scale digital
  communications, we can use practices and techniques from any or all of computer
  science, policy analysis, literary studies, sociology, and history, in varying proportions.
  In this chapter, I will demonstrate, through examples, how a beginning researcher
  of information infrastructure- the physical and technical elements of how we move
  information around-might use a similar combination of methodological approaches.
  To illustrate the broad variety of specific research techniques that a Digital-Humanities
  perspective makes available, I will introduce examples from my own research on the
  network infrastructure across West Africa, where large-scale telecommunications
  network architecture remains unevenly distributed, both between and within the regions
  nation-states. Growth rates of backbone network infrastructure (the internets highways,
  large-scale connections between cities, countries, or continents) outpace growth
  rates of access to those same networks for people in this region. The pattern contrasts
  with most of the rest of the worlds demand-driven network development (in which
  larger backbone elements are only constructed once demanded by the scale of the
  networks trying to connect to each other). The internet-comprised of physical network
  infrastructure, technical protocols, software, and the movement of data-commonly
  enters public discourse in terms of a borderless, international, global phenomenon.
  On this basis, we might expect that telecommunications policies to influence how
  internet infrastructure is developed would tend to come from global political powerhouses.
  Yet we find that Ghana, Nigeria, and even Liberia, despite their apparent relative
  weakness in a geopolitical context, appear to pursue aggressive telecommunications
  policy with broader, regional effects. This anomaly raises the central research
  question that I wanted to answer: How and why would the telecommunications policy
  strategies of these ostensibly weak states lead to a backbone-frst architecture
  for large scale internetworking throughout West Africa? Because a researcher might
  approach such a question from any of various perspectives, we have an opportunity
  to separate the project into its epistemological and methodological pieces. Epistemologically,
  the focus on its object of analysis-the effects of these case studies telecommunications
  policies on large-scale physical network infrastructure over time-gives the study
  its place astride technological and humanities ways of thinking. Methodologically,
  the approach to each piece of this puzzle highlights its own set of research practices.
  For example, to understand the actual changes to the regions network infrastructure
  over time, we can use scanning and topological analysis techniques from computer
  science. To find out how we know what a particular telecommunications policy means
  or intends, we can use both computational and heuristic reading practices. And to
  articulate whether there was actually a causal relationship between telecommunications
  policies and network infrastructure changes, we can use higher-order analyses from
  historical and public-policy perspectives. By combining the results of these methods,
  the study arrives at a unified argument to answer its question: the backbone-frst
  telecommunications policies of these ostensibly weak states are rational initiatives
  in their historical context, and they have disproportionately effective results
  on large-scale network architecture across the region. This is because their policies
  rely on, favor, and reinforce the states gatekeeper style institutions of governance-
  structures that work to concentrate political-economic power (and the perception
  of that power) at the states physical and conceptual boundaries.'

ABS: Pseudorandom Generators (PRGs) play an important role in security of systems
  and cryptographic mechanisms. Yet, there is a long history of vulnerabilities in
  practical PRGs. Significant efforts in the theoretical and practical research communities
  are invested to improve the security of PRGs, to identify faults in entropy sources,
  and to detect vulnerabilities allowing attacks against the PRGs. In this work we
  take an alternative approach at the pseudorandomness generation problem. We design
  and implement Network Pseudorandomness Collector (NPC) which collects pseudorandom
  strings from servers in the Internet. NPC does not require cooperation nor synchronisation
  of those servers. NPC is easy to use and integrate into the existing systems. We
  analyse the security of NPC and show how it addresses the main factors behind the
  vulnerabilities in current PRGs. Further, we perform extensive simulations on empirically
  derived datasets that validate the security of NPC against attacks by realistic
  Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attackers.

ABS: Cybersecurity attacks in Cloud data centres are increasing alongside the growth
  of the Cloud services market. Existing research proposes a number of anomaly detection
  systems for detecting such attacks. However, these systems encounter a number of
  challenges, specifically due to the unknown behaviour of the attacks and the occurrence
  of genuine Cloud workload spikes, which must be distinguished from attacks. In this
  paper, we discuss these challenges and investigate the issues with the existing
  Cloud anomaly detection approaches. Then, we propose a Real-time Anomaly Detection
  System (RADS) for Cloud data centres, which uses a one class classification algorithm
  and a window-based time series analysis to address the challenges. Specifically,
  RADS can detect VM-level anomalies occurring due to DDoS and cryptomining attacks.
  We evaluate the performance of RADS by running lab-based experiments and by using
  real-world Cloud workload traces. Evaluation results demonstrate that RADS can achieve
  90-95% accuracy with a low false positive rate of 0-3%. The results further reveal
  that RADS experiences fewer false positives when using its window-based time series
  analysis in comparison to using state-of-the-art average or entropy based analysis.

ABS: The security of the Internets routing infrastructure has underpinned much of
  the past two decades of distributed systems security research. However, the converse
  is increasingly true. Routing and path decisions are now important for the security
  properties of systems built on top of the Internet. In particular, BGP poisoning
  leverages the de facto routing protocol between Autonomous Systems (ASes) to maneuver
  the return paths of upstream networks onto previously unusable, new paths. These
  new paths can be used to avoid congestion, censors, geo-political boundaries, or
  any feature of the topology which can be expressed at an AS-level. Given the increase
  in BGP poisoning usage as a security primitive, we set out to evaluate poisoning
  feasibility in practice beyond simulation. To that end, using an Internet-scale
  measurement infrastructure, we capture and analyze over 1,400 instances of BGP poisoning
  across thousands of ASes as a mechanism to maneuver return paths of traffic. We
  analyze in detail the performance of steering paths, the graph-theoretic aspects
  of available paths, and re-evaluate simulated systems with this data. We find that
  the real-world evidence does not completely support the findings from simulated
  systems published in the literature. We also analyze filtering of BGP poisoning
  across types of ASes and ISP working groups. We explore the connectivity concerns
  when poisoning by reproducing a decade old experiment to uncover the current state
  of an Internet triple the size. We build predictive models for understanding an
  ASes vulnerability to poisoning. Finally, an exhaustive measurement of an upper
  bound on the maximum path length of the Internet is presented, detailing how security
  research should react to ASes leveraging poisoned long paths. In total, our results
  and analysis expose the real-world impact of BGP poisoning on past and future security

  commercialization. This result is based on analyzing topology data collected by
  CAIDA from 2000 to 2017. Power-law degree distribution is an indicator of asymmetry
  between ASs in acquiring links. The continued presence of this asymmetry is graphically
  and quantitatively characterized using Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient. Results
  show that Gini coefficient has not changed significantly through Internet development,
  recording high values ranging between 0.80 and 0.84. The study concludes that degree
  distribution asymmetry is a persistent quality of the evolving AS-level Internet
  topology, making the Internet hierarchical structure inherent.

  a longitudinal dataset (05/2016-05/2018), we show that most of the Google Global

  streaming the videos. Further, we observed that in cases where GGC nodes were dual-stacked,
  the path lengths and latencies were comparable over both address families. However,
  as generally believed, shorter path lengths did not always correlate with lower
  latency: when the video was cached by a GGC node over IPv6 only, paths were almost
  always shorter over IPv6. Yet, latencies were still lower over IPv4, indicating
  room for improvement over IPv6. GGCs reduced IP path lengths and latencies by up
  to a third over IPv4 and by up to a half over IPv6, stressing the importance of
  content cache deployments in ISP networks. To encourage reproducibility of this

  In particular, traffic classification is a subgroup of strategies in this field
  that aims at identifying the applications name or type of Internet traffic. Nowadays,
  traffic classification has become a challenging task due to the rise of new technologies,
  such as traffic encryption and encapsulation, which decrease the performance of
  classical traffic classification strategies. Machine learning (ML) gains interest
  as a new direction in this field, showing signs of future success, such as knowledge
  extraction from encrypted traffic, and more accurate Quality of Service management.
  ML is fast becoming a key tool to build traffic classification solutions in real
  network traffic scenarios; in this sense, the purpose of this investigation is to
  explore the elements that allow this technique to work in the traffic classification
  field. Therefore, a systematic review is introduced based on the steps to achieve
  traffic classification by using ML techniques. The main aim is to understand and
  to identify the procedures followed by the existing works to achieve their goals.
  As a result, this survey paper finds a set of trends derived from the analysis performed
  on this domain; in this manner, the authors expect to outline future directions

ABS: Both economic and environmental costs are driving much research in the area of
  the energy efficiency of networking equipment. This research has produced a great
  amount of proposals. However, the majority of them remain unimplemented due to the
  lack of flexibility of current hardware devices and a certain lack of enthusiasm
  from commercial vendors. At the same time, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has
  allowed customers to control switching decisions with a flexibility and precision
  previously unheard of. This paper explores the potential convergence between the
  two aforementioned trends and presents a promising power saving algorithm that can
  be implemented using standard SDN capabilities of current switches, reducing operation
  costs on both data centers and wired access networks. In particular, we focus on
  minimizing the energy consumption in bundles of energy-efficient Ethernet links
  leveraging SDN. For this, we build on an existing theoretical algorithm and adapt
  it for implementing with an SDN solution. We study several approaches and compare
  the resulting algorithms not only according to their energy efficiency, but also
  taking into account additional QoS metrics. The results show that the resulting
  algorithm is able to closely match the theoretical results, even when taking into
  account the requirements of delay-sensitive traffic.

ABS: This paper concerns the problem of finding persistent items in distributed datasets,
  which has many applications such as port scanning and intrusion detection. To the
  best of our knowledge, there is no existing solution for finding persistent items
  in distributed datasets. In this paper, we propose DISPERSE, a probabilistic algorithm
  that can find persistent items in distributed datasets without collecting all the
  datasets. Our basic idea is that each monitor compresses each item ID in its dataset
  in a lossy fashion, sends the set of lossily compressed item IDs to the server,
  then the server recovers the IDs of the persistent items. We design the lossy compression
  so that given one lossily compressed item ID, the server cannot recover the item
  ID, but when the number of lossily compressed versions of the same item ID exceeds
  a threshold, which means that such items are persistent ones, the server can recover
  the item ID with a high probability. This threshold is exactly the threshold in
  the definition of persistent items. We implemented DISPERSE and evaluated its performance.
  In comparison with the straightforward solution, DISPERSE achieves a compression
  ratio of 26.5% with FNR=3.5% and FPR=O. In comparison with a developed Bloom filter
  based scheme and the adapted kBF and IBF schemes, our scheme can achieve 7.9, 5.7,
  and 6.6 times performance gains, respectively, in terms of compression ratio.

ABS: Pushing software updates to millions of geographically diverse clients is an
  important technical challenge for software providers. In this paper, we characterize
  how content delivery networks (CDNs) are used to deliver software updates of two
  prominent operating systems (Windows and iOS), over a span of 3 years. We leverage
  a data set of DNS and ping measurements from 9,000 RIPE Atlas clients, distributed
  across 206 countries, to understand regional and temporal trends in the use of multiple
  CDNs for delivering OS updates. We contrast two competing methodologies for distributing
  OS updates employed by Microsoft and Apple, where the majority of Microsoft clients
  download Windows updates from their local ISP. But, 90% of Apple clients access
  iOS updates from Apples own network. We find an approximate improvement of 70 ms
  in the latency observed by clients in Asia and Africa when accessing content from
  edge caches in local ISPs. Additionally, Microsoft provides lower latencies to its
  clients in developing regions by directing them to Akamais rich network of edge
  caches. We also observe that clients in developing regions accessing Windows updates
  from Level 3 get poor latencies arising from the absence of Level 3s footprint in
  those regions.

ABS: Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) are Internet hubs that mainly provide the switching
  infrastructure to interconnect networks and exchange traffic. While the initial
  goal of IXPs was to bring together networks residing in the same city or country,
  and thus keep local traffic local, this model is gradually shifting. Many networks
  connect to IXPs without having physical presence at their switching infrastructure.
  This practice, called Remote Peering, is changing the Internet topology and economy,
  and has become the subject of a contentious debate within the network operators
  community. However, despite the increasing attention it attracts, the understanding
  of the characteristics and impact of remote peering is limited. In this work, we
  introduce and validate a heuristic methodology for discovering remote peers at IXPs.
  We (i) identify critical remote peering inference challenges, (ii) infer remote
  peers with high accuracy (>95%) and coverage (93%) per IXP, and (iii) characterize
  different aspects of the remote peering ecosystem by applying our methodology to
  30 large IXPs. We observe that remote peering is a significantly common practice
  in all the studied IXPs; for the largest IXPs, remote peers account for 40% of their
  member base. We also show that today, IXP growth is mainly driven by remote peering,
  which contributes two times more than local peering.

ABS: The security of Internet-based applications fundamentally relies on the trustworthiness
  of Certificate Authorities (CAs). We practically demonstrate for the first time
  that even a weak off-path attacker can effectively subvert the trustworthiness of
  popular commercially used CAs. Our attack targets CAs which use Domain Validation
  (DV) for authenticating domain ownership; collectively these CAs control 99% of
  the certificates market. The attack utilises DNS Cache poisoning and tricks the
  CA into issuing fraudulent certificates for domains the attacker does not legitimately
  own -- namely certificates binding the attackers public key to a victim domain.
  We discuss short and long term defences, but argue that they fall short of securing
  DV. To mitigate the threats we propose Domain Validation++ (DV++). DV++ replaces
  the need in cryptography through assumptions in distributed systems. While retaining
  the benefits of DV (automation, efficiency and low costs) DV++ is secure even against
  Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attackers. Deployment of DV++ is simple and does not require
  changing the existing infrastructure nor systems of the CAs. We demonstrate security
  of DV++ under realistic assumptions and provide open source access to DV++ implementation.

ABS: Recent theoretical attacks conjectured the vulnerabilities of mainstream blockchains
  through simulations or assumption violations. Unfortunately, previous results typically
  omit both the nature of the network under which the blockchain code runs and whether
  blockchains are private, consortium or public. In this paper, we study the public
  Ethereum blockchain as well as a consortium and private blockchains and quantify
  the feasibility of man-in-the-middle and double spending attacks against them. To
  this end, we list important properties of the Ethereum public blockchain topology,
  we deploy VMs with constrained CPU quantum to mimic the top-10 mining pools of Ethereum
  and we attack them, by first partitioning the network through BGP hijacking or ARP
  spooling before issuing a Balance Attack to steal coins. Our results demonstrate
  that attacking Ethereum is remarkably devastating in a consortium or private context
  as the adversary can multiply her digital assets by 200, 000x in 10 hours through
  BGP hijacking whereas it would be almost impossible in a public context.

ABS: BGP communities are a mechanism widely used by operators to manage policy, mitigate
  attacks, and engineer traffic; e.g., to drop unwanted traffic, filter announcements,
  adjust local preference, and prepend paths to influence peer selection. Unfortunately,
  we show that BGP communities can be exploited by remote parties to influence routing
  in unintended ways. The BGP community-based vulnerabilities we expose are enabled
  by a combination of complex policies, error-prone configurations, a lack of cryptographic
  integrity and authenticity over communities, and the wide extent of community propagation.
  Due in part to their ill-defined semantics, BGP communities are often propagated
  far further than a single routing hop, even though their intended scope is typically
  limited to nearby ASes. Indeed, we find 14% of transit ASes forward received BGP
  communities onward. Given the rich inter-connectivity of transit ASes, this means
  that communities effectively propagate globally. As a consequence, remote adversaries
  can use BGP communities to trigger remote blackholing, steer traffic, and manipulate
  routes even without prefix hijacking. We highlight examples of these attacks via
  scenarios that we tested and measured both in the lab as well as in the wild. While
  we suggest what can be done to mitigate such ill effects, it is up to the Internet
  operations community whether to take up the suggestions.

ABS: Pattern counting in graphs is fundamental to network science tasks, and there
  are many scalable methods for approximating counts of small patterns, often called
  motifs, in large graphs. However, modern graph datasets now contain richer structure,
  and incorporating temporal information in particular has become a critical part
  of network analysis. Temporal motifs, which are generalizations of small subgraph
  patterns that incorporate temporal ordering on edges, are an emerging part of the
  network analysis toolbox. However, there are no algorithms for fast estimation of
  temporal motifs counts; moreover, we show that even counting simple temporal star
  motifs is NP-complete. Thus, there is a need for fast and approximate algorithms.
  Here, we present the first frequency estimation algorithms for counting temporal
  motifs. More specifically, we develop a sampling framework that sits as a layer
  on top of existing exact counting algorithms and enables fast and accurate memory-efficient
  estimates of temporal motif counts. Our results show that we can achieve one to
  two orders of magnitude speedups with minimal and controllable loss in accuracy
  on a number of datasets.

ABS: Our daily lives are heavily reliant upon Internet-connected devices, services,
  and applications. This reliance makes it more critical than ever that the underlying
  networks they depend on be reliable, performant, and secure. At the same time, the
  increasing complexity and diversity of todays devices, services, and applications
  have made network management tasks more complicated than ever. Modern network management
  mandates that operators can systematically monitor what is going on in their networks
  (network monitoring) and use this information to take real-time preventive or corrective
  actions (network control). Achieving these goals while also adhering to the limited
  compute and storage resources available on modern network devices poses significant
  challenges. The contribution of this dissertation is the design and implementation
  of two systems that enable flexible and scalable network monitoring and control.
  The network monitoring system, Sonata, collects and analyzes network traffic to
  infer various network events in real time. The network-control system, SDX, enables
  fine-grained reactive control actions for interdomain traffic without disrupting
  the existing routing protocols. For each of these two systems, the dissertation
  focuses on (i) the abstractions that allow network operators to express flexible
  programs for both network monitoring and control; (ii) the algorithms that make
  the best use of limited compute and storage resources; and (iii) the systems that
  combine the high-level abstractions and the low-level algorithms and can be deployed
  in production settings. The lessons learned from this dissertation can help us design
  next-generation network-management systems. More concretely, unlike existing systems
  that rely solely on a single device-type, this dissertation shows that designing
  systems that can pool resources from a heterogeneous set of devices (targets) is
  critical for building flexible and scalable network-management systems. It also
  demonstrates that as the networking technologies and protocols evolve rapidly with
  time, it is imperative to design modular systems that can swiftly catch up with
  these changes. Finally, this research also illustrates that it is crucial to select
  strategic locations (e.g., Internet exchange points) for deployment to drive innovations
  in Internet-wide traffic monitoring and control.

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks grow significantly in volume, sophistication
  and impact. Examples are the DDoS attacks against the OVN French company and the
  DYN name provider which reached unprecedented volumes of malicious traffic in 2016.
  In general, these attacks are only detected or mitigated when they are in advanced
  stages. So far the studies show approaches and techniques focused mainly on the
  detection and mitigation of these attacks. Recently researches have emerged which
  exposes artifacts focused on the DDoS attack prediction by means of neural networks
  acting on the traffic matrix prediction; or through statistical tools, for example,
  Markovs which predict the steps of an attack, or still evaluate the stability of
  temporal series applying ARIMA, among others. Such approaches require the prior
  training of neural networks or the respective algorithms. Hence, they demand DDoS
  attack history in the network flow or attack subscriptions. The exposed approaches
  are limited to previously known attacks. In general, the overload of a DDoS attack
  victim occurs in a very short interval time (milliseconds). Thus, when the proposed
  techniques by the previous approaches can identify the closeness of an attack on
  the network, the overload is already in progress and so very close, resulting in
  the service unavailability. Different from other works, this study defends the early
  prognosis of DDoS attacks in order to avoid costs and losses from the attack. This
  work presents STARK, a self-adaptive system for DDoS attack prediction, which identifies
  attack evidence in the network before it reaches advanced stages. Based on the metastability
  theory, the STARK system provides an unsupervised statistical learning and identifies
  the DDoS attack imminence. That implies saying the system does not need prior knowledge
  of the network flow, of DDoS attack subscriptions or prior training of algorithms
  to predict the attack. The STARK system evaluation follows a trace-driven approach
  in which three datasets are used. Hence, features are extracted from these datasets
  in order to submit to the statistical indicators and evaluate the data behavior
  trends. According to the trends in the dataset behavior is possible to identify
  the closeness of a critical transition, in this case the DDoS attack imminence.
  On the carried out evaluations, with different traces, the STARK system shows capability
  of predicting the respective DDoS attacks in minutes or hours in advance.

ABS: Computer networks are present everywhere, making them a key aspect to the proper
  functioning of products and services that are often served exclusively through the
  Internet. The pervasive nature of computer networks makes them particularly suitable
  for attacks. Therefore, more than just functional systems, we are also looking for
  systems that are reliable, available, scalable and secure. A solution to meet the
  growing demands of industries and customers is cloud computing. Among several other
  advantages of this paradigm, the possibility of increased profits by reducing costs
  with infrastructure and software licenses, while allowing for virtually unlimited
  growth is particularly relevant. However, these advantages are many times shadowed
  by the increased security risks that steam from having different entities involved,
  with relationships and responsibilities not properly identified. This may lead to
  misuse or malicious attacks against cloud computing, which may compromise sensitive
  information that is stored in shared third party facilities, and many open issues
  still prevail. Due to these and other issues, it is extremely important to see new
  solutions that increase the trustworthiness of cloud computing environments and
  help to keep the continued growth in demand for virtualized resources. Facing this
  challenge, this work aims to study, analyze, propose, develop and evaluate several
  models and mechanisms to fill these gaps. Firstly, a systematic approach for selecting
  a group of candidate predictors that is suitable for cloud network traffic prediction
  is proposed. On the basis of this scenario, a predictor model for cloud network
  traffic that involves a tradeoff between prediction error, historical data dependence,
  computational costs, and timely response is proposed. Next, an Anomaly Detection
  System to support decision-making and counter attack malicious actions against cloud
  computing systems is presented. This contribution relies on network traffic prediction
  to obtain features that represent the expected appropriate behavior of the cloud
  network traffic used in conjunction with a Support Vector Machine model for detecting
  anomalous events in the cloud environment. Finally, a mechanism for determining
  the similarity level between features of the alarms is proposed. This mechanism
  aims to optimize the efficiency for generating alarms, decreasing the network data
  traffic to manage the IDS and its associated transfer costs. The benefits and drawbacks
  of the contributions were demonstrated in realistic simulations using data from
  real network traces. Furthermore, the evaluations were conducted with well-known
  metrics and the results show that all the proposed mechanisms were able to outperform
  similar proposals in literature. Computer networks are present on all sides, becoming
  a key point for the proper functioning of products and services that are offered
  exclusively through the Internet. The pervasive nature of computer networks makes
  them subject to attack. Thus, more than just functional systems, we are also looking
  for systems that are reliable, available, scalable and secure. One solution that
  meets growing demand from industry and customers is cloud computing. Among many
  other advantages of this paradigm, the ability to increase profits by reducing infrastructure
  costs and software licenses while allowing virtually unlimited growth is relevant.
  However, These advantages are often hindered by the increased security risks facing
  the entities involved, with relationships and responsibilities not properly established.
  This can lead to abuse or malicious attacks against cloud computing, which can compromise
  sensitive information that is stored and on shared third party facilities. Because
  of these and other issues, it is extremely important to devise new solutions that
  increase the confidence of the cloud computing environment and help maintain continued
  growth in demand for these features. Faced with this challenge, this thesis aims
  to study, analyze, propose, develop and evaluate various models and mechanisms to
  fill these gaps. First of all, A systematic approach for selecting a suitable candidate
  predictor group for cloud network traffic prediction is proposed. Based on this
  scenario, a prediction model for cloud network traffic that involves a relationship
  between prediction error, historical data dependency, computational costs and response
  time is proposed. Then an Anomaly Detection System to support decision making and
  combat malicious actions against cloud systems is presented. This contribution is
  based on forecasting network traffic to obtain variables that represent the expected
  proper behavior of network traffic used in conjunction with a Support Vector Machine
  model for detecting anomalous events in the cloud environment. Finally, A mechanism
  to determine the level of similarity between the variables describing an alarm is
  proposed. This mechanism aims to optimize the efficiency of alarm generation by
  reducing data traffic to manage an IDS and its associated transfer costs. The benefits
  and drawbacks of contributions have been demonstrated in realistic simulations using
  real network data. In addition, the evaluations were performed with well-known metrics

ABS: Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms are common targets for parallelization, and,
  as these algorithms are applied to larger inputs, distributed implementations become
  necessary. However, creating distributed-memory solutions involves the challenges
  of task creation, program and data partitioning, communication optimization, and
  task scheduling. In this paper we present D2P, an end-to-end system for automatically
  transforming a specification of any recursive DP algorithm into distributed-memory
  implementation of the algorithm. When given a pseudo-code of a recursive DP algorithm,
  D2P automatically generates the corresponding MPI-based implementation. Our evaluation
  of the generated distributed implementations shows that they are efficient and scalable.
  Moreover, D2P-generated implementations are faster than implementations generated
  by recent general distributed DP frameworks, and are competitive with (and often
  faster than) hand-written implementations.

ABS: Accessible and affordable access to the Internet is crucial for socio-economic
  progress in developing countries and reducing Digital Divide. The disparity in mobile
  broadband penetration between urban and rural areas in the Indian state of Tamil
  Nadu can be explained by per capita income disparities. However, despite the vast
  body of multidisciplinary research, there are still large gaps in understanding
  Tamil Nadus upstream Internet market structure and its impact on mobile broadband
  affordability. Moreover, there is a lack of research analysing the Internet market
  structure in developing countries using Network Analysis. This dissertation explores
  the presence of structural connectivity bottlenecks in the upstream Internet market
  for three mobile operator networks in Tamil Nadu. The exploration employs Complex
  and Statistical Network Analysis on primary data collected via active Internet periphery
  measurements through the Portolan application. The results obtained indicate the
  existence of hierarchical upstream Internet market structures for all operator networks.
  Moreover, the collected evidence indicates the reliance of mobile operators connectivity
  on Tier-1 Internet Service Providers, while also revealing new Autonomous System
  relationships. This collected evidence highlights the crucial role that the level
  of hierarchical structuring of upstream Internet market structures plays in determining
  affordability. We show that endusers prices per Megabyte increase with the level
  of hierarchical structuring, indicating the policy relevance of assessing Complex
  Network metrics to understand and address the hierarchical structuring of the relevant
  markets. In conclusions, this work indicates the importance of studying structural
  bottlenecks and connectivity hubs, as our evidence shows that the upstream Internet
  market structure also defines the bargaining powers exerted by Internet Service
  Providers, resulting in reduced competition and less affordable price plans. These
  results should also nudge policymakers efforts to consider the different roles of
  bottlenecks and hub-like Internet Service Providers when aiming to reduce the Digital
  Divide.

ABS: DiffServ was designed to implement service provider quality of service (QoS)
  policies, where ingress and egress routers change the DiffServ Code Point (DSCP)
  in the IP header. However, nowadays, applications are beginning to directly set
  the DSCP themselves, in the hope that this will yield a more appropriate service
  for their respective video, audio and data streams. WebRTC is a prime example of
  such an application. As a first step towards understanding whether WebRTC QoS works,
  we measured, for both IPv4 and IPv6, what happens to DSCP values along Internet
  paths. Our study is based on end-to-end measurements from 160 IPv4 and 65 IPv6 geographically
  spread controlled probe clients to 34 IPv4 and 18 IPv6 servers respectively. Clearly,
  when the DSCP value is changed, the net result may not be what the application desired.
  We find that this happens often, and conclude with recommendations on how to improve
  WebRTC and other applications using the DSCP.

ABS: This paper aims to accurately realize given traffic split ratios in switches
  with small performance degradation. For given traffic split ratios calculated mathematically
  by TE algorithms in the control plane, the load distribution mechanisms in the data
  plane implement such splits without breaking flows. Treating all flows equally,
  the state-of-the-art approaches deployed in switches do not provide enough accuracy
  especially when facing non-uniform flow size distribution. We instead propose a
  dynamic load distribution scheme based on the collected load sharing statistics.
  It finds the most accurate traffic splits with minimum route changes. We implement
  our solution in Open vSwitch (OVS). Trace-driven and end-to- end experiments demonstrate
  that 1) our approach effectively adjusts load distribution in real time to mitigate
  the inaccuracy of splits caused by the variation of flow size distribution, 2) it
  outperforms the existing approaches with respect to both higher accuracy and lower
  level of route changes, and 3) it requires path changes for less flows when routing
  strategies are reconfigured, hence leads to better flow experience such as higher
  goodput.

ABS: The Internet not only facilitates our daily activities, such as communication,
  entertainment and shopping but also serves as the enabling technology for many critical
  services, including finance, manufacturing, healthcare and transportation. On the
  other hand, a wide spectrum of attacks targets its communication infrastructure
  to disable or disrupt the network connectivity and traffic flow until recovery processes
  take place. Attacking all autonomous systems (ASes) in the Internet is typically
  beyond the capability of an adversary. Therefore, targeting a small number of ASes
  which results in the highest impact is the best strategy for attackers. Similarly,
  it is important for network practitioners to identify, fortify and secure those
  critical ASes to mitigate the impact of the attacks. In this study we introduce
  an intuitive and effective measure, IP address spatial path stress centrality, to
  assess and identify the critical ASes in the Internet. We compare IP address spatial
  path stress centrality to the three well-known and widely used centrality measures,
  namely customer-cone size, node degree and betweenness. We demonstrate that the
  proposed measure incorporates business relations and IP address spaces to achieve
  a better measure for identifying the critical ASes in the Internet.

ABS: Caching popular content locally has been shown to be an efficient way for internet
  service providers (ISPs) to reduce transit fees and improve the quality of their
  services. Recently, with the development of information-centric networking, content-peering,
  which allows peering ISPs to access each others cache, has attracted interest. However,
  due to the economic structure and policy routing of the internet, content peering
  is only applicable between settlement-free peering ISPs, which constraints the benefit
  of inter-domain cache sharing. In this study, we consider extending the inter-domain
  cache sharing to ISPs with different tiers; this is done to take full advantage
  of the caching resources. Specifically, we identify the special properties of the
  inter-domain cache-sharing market with ISPs of different tiers, analyze the ISPs
  interactions, and employ Nash bargaining solutions to address the resource allocation
  issues in the market. In addition, we present decentralized algorithms to realize
  the proposed mechanism for large-scale networks. We show the correctness of the
  proposed method through rigorous analysis, and we verify the benefits to ISPs by
  carrying out extensive experiments.

ABS: Distributed software-defined networking (SDN), consisting of multiple inter-connected
  network domains, each managed by one SDN controller, is an emerging networking architecture
  that offers balanced centralized control and distributed operations. In this work,
  we study such network architecture from both experimental and analytical perspectives.
  Specifically, we implement a wireless SDN multi-controller system, where the controllers
  communicate to each other and to data plane-devices through WiFi multi-hop links.
  We measure the corresponding traffic delay and overheads. The results reveal the
  sensitivity of delay to the location of controllers and the magnitude of inter-controller
  and controller-node overheads. Such experiments highlight the feasibility of distributed
  SDN and the overheads of their operations including the overheads due to synchronizations.
  Therefore, it is challenging to achieve full status synchronizations among controllers
  in a real system. In this regard, we analyze and quantify the performance enhancement
  of distributed SDN architectures, which is influenced by intra-/inter-domain synchronization
  levels and network structural properties. Based on a generic network model, we establish
  analytical methods for performance estimation under four canonical inter-domain
  synchronization scenarios. Specifically, we first derive an asymptotic expression
  to quantify how dominating structural and synchronization-related parameters affect
  the performance metric. We then provide performance analytics for an important family
  of networks, where all links are of equal preference for path constructions. Finally,
  we establish fine-grained performance metric expressions for networks with dynamically
  adjusted link preferences. Our theoretical results reveal how network performance
  is related to synchronization levels and intra-/inter-domain connections, the accuracy
  of which is confirmed by simulations based on both real and synthetic networks.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work quantifying the performance
  of distributed SDN analytically, which provides fundamental guidance for future
  SDN protocol designs and performance estimation

GEOLOC: Calgary, CA
ABS: A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a type of cyber-attack in which
  the perpetrator aims to deny the services on a network/server by inundating the
  traffic on the network/server by superfluous requests which renders it incapable
  to serve requests from legitimate users. According to Corero Network Security (A
  DDoS protection and mitigation provider), in Q3 2017, organizations around the world
  experienced an average of 237 DDoS attack attempts per month, which averages to
  8 DDoS attacks every day. This was a 35% increase over Q2 that year and a staggering
  91% increase over Q1. According to another research by Incapsula, a DDoS attack
  costs an average of $40,000 per hour to businesses. There are commercially available
  software which detect and mitigate a DDoS attack, but the high cost of these software
  makes them hard to afford for small and mid-scale businesses. The proposed work
  aims to fill this gap by providing real time open-source robust web application
  for DDoS attack prediction which can be used by small to mid-scale industries to
  keep their networks and servers secure from malicious DDoS attacks. A Machine Learning
  approach is used to employ a window-based technique to predict a DDoS attack in
  a network with a maximum accuracy of 99.83%, if the recommended combination of feature
  selection and classification algorithm is chosen. The choice of both feature selection
  and classification algorithm is left to the user. One of the feature selection algorithms
  is the novel Weighted Ranked Feature Selection(WRFS) algorithm which performs better
  than other baseline approaches in terms of accuracy of detection and the overhead
  to build the model. Once the selection is made, the web application connects to
  the socket and starts capturing and classifying real-time network traffic. After
  the capture is stopped, information about attack instances (if any), number of attack
  packets, confusion matrix is rendered to the client using dynamic charts. The trained
  model used for classifying real-time packets is optimized and uses only enough attributes
  from the incoming packet which are necessary to successfully predict the class of
  that packet with high accuracy.

  one which appears to be run by a separate operator. We designed and conducted a
  global DNS Cache Probing study on the matching domain names in order to identify
  in which countries each operator was spying. Our technique identified a total of
  45 countries where Pegasus operators may be conducting surveillance operations.
  At least 10 Pegasus operators appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance.
  Our findings paint a bleak picture of the human rights risks of NSOs global proliferation.
  At least six countries with significant Pegasus operations have previously been
  linked to abusive use of spyware to target civil society, including Bahrain, Kazakhstan,
  Mexico, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Pegasus also appears
  to be in use by countries with dubious human rights records and histories of abusive
  behaviour by state security services. In addition, we have found indications of
  possible political themes within targeting materials in several countries, casting
  doubt on whether the technology is being used as part of legitimate criminal investigations.

ABS: Determining the shortest-path distance between vertices in the weighted graph
  is an important problem for a broad range of fields, such as context-aware search
  and route selection. While many efficient methods for querying shortest-path distance
  have been proposed, they are poorly suited for parallel architectures, such as multi-core
  CPUs or computer clusters, due to the strong task dependencies. In this paper, we
  propose ParaPLL, a new parallelism-friendly framework for fast shortest-path distance
  query on large-scale weighted graphs. ParaPLL exploits intra-node and internode
  parallelism by using shared memory and message passing paradigms respectively. We
  also design task assignment and synchronization policies, which allow ParaPLL to
  reach remarkable speedups compared to state-of-the-art solutions. Moreover, we also
  prove the correctness of ParaPLL. To the best of our knowledge, ParaPLL is the first
  parallel framework that utilizing pruned landmark labeling to accelerate shortest-path
  distance queries on large-scale weighted graphs. Our evaluation results show that
  ParaPLL is 9.46 times faster than the corresponding serial version on a weighted
  0.3M-vertex graph using a 12-core computer. ParaPLL on a 6-node computer cluster
  can also achieve a speedup of up to 5.6 over the single-node implementation.

ABS: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the inter-domain routing protocol in the global

  many risks such as prefix hijacking, path tampering and route leak. It has been
  a number of effective solutions proposed for prefix hijacking and path tampering.
  But route leak is difficult to be detected, because it only violates the outbound
  route policy. In this paper, we use the RouteViews to capture the BGP Update messages
  in the Internet and analyze the network routes which may leaked. On the basis of
  analyzing some advantages and disadvantages of the related works, we propose three
  security mechanisms against the error configuration and malicious attack causing
  route leak. These mechanisms make use of the BGPsec encryption and signature mechanism
  to protect the Autonomous System (AS) business relationship and to defense route
  leak. Finally, we verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed security
  mechanisms by simulations with Quagga.

ABS: Software-Defined eXchanges (SDXes) promise to improve the interdomain routing
  ecosystem through SDN deployment. Yet, the naive deployment of SDN on the Internet
  raises concerns about the correctness of the interdomain data-plane. By allowing
  operators to deflect traffic from default BGP routes, SDN policies can create permanent
  forwarding loops that are not visible to the control-plane. We propose Prelude,
  a system for detecting SDN-induced forwarding loops between SDXes with high accuracy
  without leaking private routing information of network operators. To achieve this,
  we leverage Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) techniques to build a novel and
  general privacy-preserving primitive that detects whether any subset of SDN rules
  might affect the same portion of traffic without learning anything about those rules.
  We then leverage this primitive as the main building block of a distributed system
  tailored to detect forwarding loops among any set of SDXes. We leverage the particular
  nature of SDXes to further improve the efficiency of our SMPC solution. The number
  of valid SDN rules rejected by our solution is 100x lower than previous privacy-preserving
  solutions, and provides better privacy guarantees. Furthermore, our solution naturally
  provides network operators with some insights on the cost of the deflected paths.

ABS: Volumetric attacks, which overwhelm the bandwidth of a destination, are among
  the most common distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks today. Despite considerable
  effort made by both research and industry, our recent interviews with over 100 potential
  DDoS victims in over 10 industry segments indicate that todays DDoS prevention is
  far from perfect. On one hand, few academical proposals have ever been deployed
  in the Internet; on the other hand, solutions offered by existing DDoS prevention
  vendors are not silver bullet to defend against the entire attack spectrum. Guided
  by such large-scale study of todays DDoS defense, in this paper, we present MiddlePolice,
  the first readily deployable and proactive DDoS prevention mechanism. We carefully
  architect MiddlePolice such that it requires no changes from both the Internet core
  and the network stack of clients, yielding instant deployability in the current
  Internet architecture. Further, relying on our novel capability feedback mechanism,
  MiddlePolice is able to enforce destination-driven traffic control so that it guarantees
  to deliver victim-desired traffic regardless of the attacker strategies. We implement
  a prototype of MiddlePolice and demonstrate its feasibility via extensive evaluations
  in the Internet, hardware testbed, and large-scale simulations.

ABS: Cyber-situational awareness is crucial to applications such as network monitoring
  and management, vulnerability assessment, and defense. To gain improved cyber-situational
  awareness, analysts can benefit from automated reasoning-based frameworks. However,
  such frameworks would require the processing of enormous amounts of network data,
  which are characterized by syntactic variability. The formal representation of networking
  concepts, their properties, and interrelations using RDF can narrow the interoperability
  gaps between routing information and network semantics. Formal knowledge representation
  also enables automated reasoning, which facilitates network knowledge discovery
  by making implicit statements explicit. However, capturing and reasoning over the
  provenance of RDF statements, which is essential to build analysts trust in automated
  support tools, is not trivial. This paper presents a novel framework for capturing
  provenance-aware network knowledge to enable automated reasoning for network applications
  that require cyber-situational awareness.

ABS: In rapid and massive data streams, it is often not possible to estimate the frequency
  of items with complete accuracy. To perform the operation in a reasonable amount
  of space and with sufficiently low latency, approximated methods are used. The most
  common ones are variations of the Count-Min sketch. By using multiple hash functions,
  they summarize massive streams in sub-linear space. In reality, data item ids or
  keys can be modular, e.g., a graph edge is represented by source and target node
  ids, a 32-bit IP address is composed of four 8-bit words, a web address consists
  of domain name, domain extension, path, and filename, among many others. In this
  paper, we investigate the modularity property of item keys, and systematically develop
  more accurate, composite hashing strategies, such as employing multiple independent
  hash functions that hash different modules in a key and their combinations separately,
  instead of hashing the entire key directly into the sketch. However, our problem
  of finding the best hashing strategy is non-trivial, since there are exponential
  number of ways to combine the modules of a key before they can be hashed into the
  sketch. Moreover, given a fixed size allocated for the entire sketch, it is hard
  to find the optimal range of all hash functions that correspond to different modules
  and their combinations. We solve both these problems with extensive theoretical
  analysis, and perform thorough experiments with real-world datasets to demonstrate
  the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method, MOD-Sketch.

ABS: Fault tolerance is critical for distributed stream processing systems, yet achieving
  error-free fault tolerance often incurs substantial performance overhead. We present
  AF-Stream, a distributed stream processing system that addresses the trade-off between
  performance and accuracy in fault tolerance. AF-Stream builds on a notion called
  approximate fault tolerance, whose idea is to mitigate backup overhead by adaptively
  issuing backups, while ensuring that the errors upon failures are bounded with theoretical
  guarantees. Our AF-Stream design provides an extensible programming model for incorporating
  general streaming algorithms as well as exports only few threshold parameters for
  configuring approximation fault tolerance. Furthermore, we formally prove that AF-Stream
  preserves high algorithm-specific accuracy of streaming algorithms, and in particular
  the convergence guarantees of online learning. Experiments show that AF-Stream maintains
  high performance (compared to no fault tolerance) and high accuracy after multiple
  failures (compared to no failures) under various streaming algorithms.

ABS: Internet anycast depends on inter-domain routing to direct clients to their closest
  sites. Using data collected from a root DNS server for over a year (400M+ queries/day
  from 100+ sites), we characterize the load balancing and latency performance of
  global anycast. Our analysis shows that site loads are often unbalanced, and that
  most queries travel longer than necessary, many by over 5000 km. Investigating the
  root causes of these inefficiencies, we can attribute path inflation to two causes.
  Like unicast, anycast routes are subject to inter-domain routing topology and policies
  that can increase path length compared to theoretical shortest (e.g., great-circle
  distance). Unlike unicast, anycast routes are also affected by poor route selection
  when paths to multiple sites are available, subjecting anycast routes to an additional,
  unnecessary, penalty. Unfortunately, BGP provides no information about the number
  or goodness of reachable anycast sites. We propose an additional hint in BGP advertisements
  for anycast routes that can enable ISPs to make better choices when multiple equally
  good routes are available. Our results show that use of such routing hints can eliminate
  much of the anycast path inflation, enabling anycast to approach the performance
  of unicast routing.

ABS: Large-scale Internet attacks are pervasive. A broad spectrum of actors from organized
  gangs of criminals to nation-states exploit the modern, layered Internet to launch
  politically and economically motivated attacks. The impact of these attacks is vast,
  ranging from billions of users experiencing Internet censorship, to tens of millions
  of dollars lost annually to cybercrime. Developing effective and comprehensive defenses
  to these large scale threats requires systematic empirical measurement. In this
  dissertation we develop empirical measurement methods and systems for understanding
  politically and economically motivated Internet threats. Specifically, we examine
  the problems of Internet censorship and advertising abuse in-depth and at-scale.
  To understand censorship, we develop Augur and Iris, methods and accompanying systems
  that allow us to perform global, longitudinal measurement of Internet censorship
  at the TCP/IP and DNS layers of the network stack-without the use of volunteers.
  This work addresses a range of both technical and extra-technical challenges, at
  a scale and fidelity not previously achieved. In combating advertising abuse, we
  investigate and chronicle multiple facets of the ecosystem-from clickbots to large-scale
  botnets to advertising injection-using a variety of empirical methods. Our work
  ultimately identifies fundamental structural weak-points leverageable for defense,
  resulting in dismantling botnets, cleaning up ad networks, and protecting users.

ABS: 'User anonymity faces increasing threats from private companies, network service
  providers, and governmental surveillance programs. Current anonymous communication
  systems running as overlay networks offer neither satisfactory performance to support
  diverse Internet applications nor strong security guarantees. As Future Internet
  Architectures emerge and propose to equip routers with cryptographic operations,
  this thesis aims to answer the question: what level of security guarantee and performance
  can anonymous communication system offer if designed as a service of the network
  infrastructure? This thesis thus presents three scalable and highly efficient infrastructure-based
  anonymous communication systems, HORNET, PHI, and TARANET, defeating adversaries
  ranging from a single malicious Internet Service Provider to governments conducting
  mass surveillance. Our contributions are summarized below: 1. We present HORNET,
  a low-latency onion routing system that operates at the network layer thus enabling
  a wide range of applications. HORNET uses only symmetric cryptography for data forwarding
  and requires no per-flow state on intermediate routers to achieve high scalability.
  This design enables HORNET routers implemented on off-the-shelf workstation to process
  anonymous traffic at over 93 Gb/s. 2. We propose PHI, a Path-HIdden lightweight
  anonymity protocol that fixes two vulnerabilities of LAP and Dovetail. We present
  an efficient packet header format that hides path information and a new back-off
  setup method that is compatible with current and future network architectures. Our
  experiments demonstrate that PHI expands anonymity sets of LAP and Dovetail by over
  30x and reaches 120 Gb/s forwarding speed on a commodity software router. 3. We
  propose TARANET, an anonymity system that implements protection against traffic
  analysis at the network layer, and limits the incurred latency and overhead. In
  TARANETs setup phase, traffic analysis is thwarted by mixing. In the data transmission
  phase, end hosts and Autonomous Systems coordinate to shape traffic into constant-rate
  transmission using packet splitting. Our prototype implementation shows that TARANET
  can forward anonymous traffic at over 50 Gb/s using commodity hardware. In summary,
  this thesis demonstrates that it is not only viable but also beneficial to build
  infrastructure based anonymous communication systems. The proposed schemes achieve
  a new level of scalability and performance and characterize a general trade-off
  between anonymity guarantees and performance that guides future infrastructure-based
  anonymous communication system designs.'

ABS: DNS queries from end users are handled by recursive DNS servers for scalability.
  For convenience, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) assign recursive servers for
  their clients automatically when the clients choose the default network settings.
  But users should also have the flexibility to use their preferred recursive servers,
  like public DNS servers. This kind of trust, however, can be broken by the hidden
  interception of the DNS resolution path (which we term as DNSIntercept). Specifically,
  on-path devices could spoof the IP addresses of user specified DNS servers and intercept
  the DNS queries surreptitiously, introducing privacy and security issues. In this
  paper, we perform a large-scale analysis of onpath DNS interception and shed light
  on its scope and characteristics. We design novel approaches to detect DNS interception
  and leverage 148,478 residential and cellular IP addresses around the world for
  analysis. As a result, we find that 259 of the 3,047 ASes (8.5%) that we inspect
  exhibit DNS interception behavior, including large providers, such as China Mobile.
  Moreover, we find that the DNS servers of the ASes which intercept requests may
  use outdated vulnerable software (deprecated before 2009) and lack security-related
  functionality, such as handling DNSSEC requests. Our work highlights the issues
  around on path DNS interception and provides new insights for addressing such issues.

ABS: Data has became one of the most valuable resources in todays world where we have
  greater digital presence. Large volumes of data are generated through various platforms
  including web, social networks, mobile devices, scientific instruments, infrastructure
  sensors, and variety of IoT devices. A challenge for researchers is to mine valuable
  relevant information from big data efficiently and in a timely manner. Internet
  is the largest man-made complex system whose underlying network has not been characterized
  precisely. Internet topology is shaped by tens of thousands of network providers
  optimizing local communication efficiency without a central authority. Numerous
  methods and platforms have been developed to accurately measure and analyze the
  Internet topology. In this dissertation, we perform a comprehensive analysis of
  the existing Internet topology data sets, develop and deploy our own Internet Measurement
  (IM) platform to obtain detailed topologies of Autonomous System (AS) networks,
  and analyze collected data to understand the characteristics of backbone networks.
  Our results indicate that use of multiple data sets from different vantage points
  is important for building a comprehensive picture of the Internet topology as each
  data set provides a unique contribution to the visibility of a network. Utilizing
  earlier measurement data sets, we implement an Internet topology mapping and analysis
  system that collects detailed measurements from a set of IM nodes. The Autonomous
  System Mapper (ASM) intelligently utilizes the big data collection and processing
  approaches for mapping the Internets underlying topology in order to better understand
  network characteristics. ASM discovers more than thirteen times links of all other
  data repositories combined. Analyzing collected network data, we observe that most
  of the ASes have star-like topologies where high degree hubs connect low degree
  routers but tier-1 ASes often have a power-law degree distribution in a small-world
  network topology; there are persistent routing anomalies and loops in the end-to-end
  communication over the Internet; and network paths within individual ASes are mostly
  non-shortest paths indicating load distribution by the Internet Service Providers
  (ISP).

ABS: 'Routing attacks remain practically effective in the Internet today as existing
  countermeasures either fail to provide protection guarantees or are not easily deployable.
  Blockchain systems are particularly vulnerable to such attacks as they rely on Internet-wide
  communication to reach consensus. In particular, Bitcoin -the most widely-used cryptocurrency-
  can be split in half by any AS-level adversary using BGP hijacking. In this paper,
  we present SABRE, a secure and scalable Bitcoin relay network which relays blocks
  worldwide through a set of connections that are resilient to routing attacks. SABRE
  runs alongside the existing peer-to-peer network and is easily deployable. As a
  critical system, SABRE design is highly resilient and can efficiently handle high
  bandwidth loads, including Denial of Service attacks. We built SABRE around two
  key technical insights. First, we leverage fundamental properties of inter-domain
  routing (BGP) policies to host relay nodes: (i) in locations that are inherently
  protected against routing attacks; and (ii) on paths that are economically preferred
  by the majority of Bitcoin clients. These properties are generic and can be used
  to protect other Blockchain-based systems. Second, we leverage the fact that relaying
  blocks is communication-heavy, not computation-heavy. This enables us to offload
  most of the relay operations to programmable network hardware (using the P4 programming
  language). Thanks to this hardware/software co-design, SABRE nodes operate seamlessly
  under high load while mitigating the effects of malicious clients. We present a
  complete implementation of SABRE together with an extensive evaluation. Our results
  demonstrate that SABRE is effective at securing Bitcoin against routing attacks,
  even with deployments as small as 6 nodes.'

ABS: 'Modern networked systems are in perpetual need of novel tools that can diagnose
  suspicious activities and thwart cyber attacks arising from diverse threats and
  vulnerabilities. The massive upsurge in the number of devices connected to a network
  and associated traffic volume, as well as an addition of new, complex technologies
  to existing ones have intensified the need to have a deep understanding of systems.
  From a security perspective, we are noticing that the user behavior is bordering
  high on anxiety, which is further increasing the quantum measure of data collection
  before rightfully understanding the legitimate need behind it. Mirroring this is
  the rapid inclusion of security experts as part of the core team that designs and
  builds platforms and networks. This increases the awareness of potential attack
  vectors that may impact these systems. However, data analytics (not necessarily
  security-related) has further intensified the need to gather as much data as possible,
  leaving it to the security experts to come up with tools to analyze them. While
  this is a daunting task for all involved parties and cannot be excused from, it
  is critical to scale these monitoring and analysis infrastructures to meet the demands
  and purpose of collecting data. Existing technologies come in the form of intrusion
  detection systems like anti-virus tools, and intrusion prevention systems like firewalls.
  They deploy various approaches to succeed in detecting and preventing intrusions.
  Generally, intrusion detection techniques are classified into two categories: misuse
  detection and anomaly detection. However, the implementation has been ever-changing
  keeping the types of systems, data analysis, increasing attack surface and intrusions
  in mind. And with the rapid evolution in the digital milieu and an explosion in
  data collected, there is a need to propose novel approaches that address the big
  data problem in security. This thesis proposes a new approach to intrusion detection
  in networks. This approach is based on Information Centrality (IC) using which systemic
  attacks can perform the same level of intrusion detection using approximately 50%
  of the total nodes. IC labels network nodes with better vantage points for detecting
  network-based anomalies as central nodes. The main idea is that since these central
  nodes already observe most of the data flowing through the network, they are in
  a good position to detect anomalous behavior much before other nodes. This research
  first dives into the important role played by graphs in understanding the topology
  and flow of information. We then introduce the usage of an existing concept in the
  field of social networks - information centrality, a centrality based index, to
  minimize data collection in existing communication networks. IC identifies important
  nodes that can accelerate anomaly detection when armed with a suitable anomaly detection
  technique. We also come up with a heuristics approach that can be used instead of
  Information centrality in order to gather a similar outcome for very large networks.
  Finally, we demonstrate that in the case of systemic anomalies, central nodes are
  capable of identifying them much faster than other non-central nodes.'

ABS: Managing and securing networks requires collecting and analyzing network traffic
  data in real time. Existing telemetry systems do not allow operators to express
  the range of queries needed to perform management or scale to large traffic volumes
  and rates. We present Sonata, an expressive and scalable telemetry system that coordinates
  joint collection and analysis of network traffic. Sonata provides a declarative
  interface to express queries for a wide range of common telemetry tasks; to enable
  real-time execution, Sonata partitions each query across the stream processor and
  the data plane, running as much of the query as it can on the network switch, at
  line rate. To optimize the use of limited switch memory, Sonata dynamically refines
  each query to ensure that available resources focus only on traffic that satisfies
  the query. Our evaluation shows that Sonata can support a wide range of telemetry
  tasks while reducing the workload for the stream processor by as much as seven orders
  of magnitude compared to existing telemetry systems.

ABS: Secure socket layer/transport layer security (TLS) is the de facto protocol for
  providing secure communications over the Internet. It relies on the web PKI model
  for authentication and secure key exchange. Despite its relatively successful past,
  the number of web PKI incidents observed have increased recently. These incidents
  revealed the risks of forged certificates issued by certificate authorities without
  the consent of the domain owners. Several solutions have been proposed to solve
  this problem but no solution has yet received widespread adoption due to complexity
  and deployability issues. In this study, the authors propose an effective solution
  for this problem that allows a TLS server to detect a certificate substitution attack
  against its domain across the Internet. The proposed solution is practical and allows
  a smooth and gradual transition. They also give a triangulation algorithm enabling
  the server to find out the origin of the attack. They conducted simulation experiments
  using real-world BGP data and showed that their proposal can be effective for detecting
  and locating attacks using relatively few vantage points over the Internet.

ABS: The Count-Min sketch is an important and well-studied data summarization method.
  It can estimate the count of any item in a stream using a small, fixed size data
  sketch. However, the accuracy of the Count-Min sketch depends on characteristics
  of the underlying data. This has led to a number of count estimation procedures
  which work well in one scenario but perform poorly in others. A practitioner is
  faced with two basic, unanswered questions. Given an estimate, what is its error?
  Which estimation procedure should be chosen when the data is unknown? We provide
  answers to these questions. We derive new count estimators, including a provably
  optimal estimator, which best or match previous estimators in all scenarios. We
  also provide practical, tight error bounds at query time for all estimators and
  methods to tune sketch parameters using these bounds. The key observation is that
  the full distribution of errors in each counter can be empirically estimated from
  the sketch itself. By first estimating this distribution, count estimation becomes
  a statistical estimation and inference problem with a known error distribution.
  This provides both a principled way to derive new and optimal estimators as well
  as a way to study the error and properties of existing estimators.

ABS: 'The likelihood of suffering damage from an attack is obvious with the exponential
  growth in the size of computer networks and the internet. Meanwhile, intrusion detection
  systems (IDSs) and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) are one of the most important
  defensive tools against the ever more sophisticated and ever-growing frequency of
  network attacks. Anomaly-based research in intrusion detection systems suffers from
  inaccurate deployment, analysis and evaluation due to the lack of an adequate dataset.
  A number of datasets such as DARPA98, KDD99, ISC2012, and ADFA13 have been used
  by the researchers to evaluate the performance of their proposed intrusion detection
  and intrusion prevention approaches. Based on our study of 16 datasets since 1998,
  many are out of date and unreliable. There are various shortcomings: lack of traffic
  diversity and volume, incomplete attack coverage, anonymized pack et information
  and payload which does not reflect the current reality, or they lack some feature
  set and metadata. This paper focused on CICIDS2017 as the last updated IDS dataset
  that contains benign and seven common attack network flows, which meets real world
  criteria and is publicly available. It also evaluates the effectiveness of a set
  of network traffic features and machine learning algorithms to indicate the best
  set of features for detecting an attack category. Furthermore, we define the concept
  of super features which are high quality derived features using a dimension reduction
  algorithm. We show that the random forest algorithm as one of our best performing
  algorithm can achieve better results with super features versus top selected features.'

ABS: How can we find patterns and anomalies in a tensor, i.e., multi-dimensional array,
  in an efficient and directly interpretable way? How can we do this in an online
  environment, where a new tensor arrives at each time step? Finding patterns and
  anomalies in multi-dimensional data have many important applications, including
  building safety monitoring, health monitoring, cyber security, terrorist detection,
  and fake user detection in social networks. Standard tensor decomposition results
  are not directly interpretable and few methods that propose to increase interpretability
  need to be made faster, more memory efficient, and more accurate for large and quickly
  generated data in the online environment. We propose two versions of a fast, accurate,
  and directly interpretable tensor decomposition method we call CTD that is based
  on efficient sampling method. First is the static version of CTD, i.e., CTD-S, that
  provably guarantees up to 11x higher accuracy than that of the state-of-the-art
  method. Also, CTD-S is made up to 2.3x faster and up to 24x more memory-efficient
  than the state-of-the-art method by removing redundancy. Second is the dynamic version
  of CTD, i.e. CTD-D, which is the first interpretable dynamic tensor decomposition
  method ever proposed. It is also made up to 82x faster than the already fast CTD-S
  by exploiting factors at previous time step and by reordering operations. With CTD,
  we demonstrate how the results can be effectively interpreted in online distributed
  denial of service (DDoS) attack detection and online troll detection.

ABS: In the last years, the economic and environmental costs related to energy consumption
  led to efforts for enhancing the energy efficiency of networking equipment. Unfortunately,
  most of the proposals have not been implemented due to the limited flexibility of
  current networks. On the other hand, the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm
  introduces flexibility and programmability through the separation of control and
  data planes. In this thesis, we focus on minimizing the energy consumption in bundles
  of Energy Efficient Ethernet links leveraging SDN. We first analyze the problem
  from the point of view of SDN. Then, we design a complete application to minimize
  the energy consumption by periodically reallocating the traffic flows in the ports
  of the aggregate, dynamically adapting to variations in the traffic demand. We validate
  the proposed algorithms through simulations and also by implementing the application
  in a real SDN controller. The results show that our algorithms are capable of concentrating
  the traffic in few ports, saving up to a 50 % of energy when there is a low traffic
  load. Nevertheless, the results show a trade-off between energy consumption and
  packet delay. Accordingly, we extend our solution to give support to traffic with
  low latency QoS requirements while keeping energy consumption minimized. Our results
  confirm that the latency of time-sensitive traffic can be reduced some orders of
  magnitude without increasing the energy consumption.

ABS: Hierarchically structured addresses have been proposed to improve the scalability
  of the Internet. However, the crucial component and primary challenge of hierarchical
  addressing is the locator selection because the number of locators could be unmanageably
  large. In this paper, we propose two methods to select and allocate locators. The
  first method can reduce the number of locators and Forwarding Information Base (FIB)
  entries, but it fails to address the path stretch problem. In the second approach,
  we leverage hierarchical address allocation and flat identifiers to efficiently
  represent locators. Provider-based locators can be aggregated to reduce the number
  of FIB entries, while provider-independent locators can help to reduce path stretch.
  We investigate the performance and efficiency of the two approaches by performing
  a large-scale measurement based on todays Internet topology. Our evaluation shows
  that the second approach could reduce the number of locators with small path stretch.

ABS: In this paper, we present Nyx, the first system to both effectively mitigate
  modern Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks regardless of the amount of
  traffic under adversarial control and function without outside cooperation or an
  Internet redesign. Nyx approaches the problem of DDoS mitigation as a routing problem
  rather than a filtering problem. This conceptual shift allows Nyx to avoid many
  of the common shortcomings of existing academic and commercial DDoS mitigation systems.
  By leveraging how Autonomous Systems (ASes) handle route advertisement in the existing
  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), Nyx allows the deploying AS to achieve isolation
  of traffic from a critical upstream AS off of attacked links and onto alternative,
  uncongested, paths. This isolation removes the need for filtering or de-prioritizing
  attack traffic. Nyx controls outbound paths through normal BGP path selection, while
  return paths from critical ASes are controlled through the use of specific techniques
  we developed using existing traffic engineering principles and require no outside
  coordination. Using our own realistic Internet-scale simulator, we find that in
  more than 98% of cases our system can successfully route critical traffic around
  network segments under transit-link DDoS attacks; a new form of DDoS attack where
  the attack traffic never reaches the victim AS, thus invaliding defensive filtering,
  throttling, or prioritization strategies. More significantly, in over 95% of those
  cases, the alternate path provides complete congestion relief from transit-link

ABS: Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM) chips are used to store Forwarding
  Information Bases (FIB) in modern routers. TCAM provides next hop lookup for IP
  packets at the line-rate. However, TCAM is expensive and energy-consuming; in addition,
  the constant FIB growth may lead to TCAM overflow problem. Yet only a small portion
  of FIB entries carries the most of the network traffic. Thus, FIB caching, namely,
  installing the most popular entries in a fast memory, e.g., TCAM, may significantly
  minimize TCAM usage. In this work, we leverage the concept of the programmable data
  plane to design a Programmable FIB Caching Architecture (PFCA) with two levels of
  cache. We present a pipeline-based algorithm to detect the least popular prefixes
  in a cache for victim eviction. We tested the prototype of PFCA using real traffic
  traces and an FIB with more than 599K entries. Our results show that PFCA achieves
  99.8% hit ratio for Level-1 cache with 20K entries and nearly 99.9% hit ratio for
  Level-2 cache with 40K entries. We also demonstrate that PFCA significantly reduces
  the number of BGP updates in the cache and thus makes the cache more stable.

ABS: Hypergiants, such as Google or Netflix, are important organisations in the Internet
  ecosystem, due to their sheer impact in terms of trac volume exchanged. However,
  the research community still lacks a suciently crisp definition for them, beyond
  naming specific instances of them. In this paper we analyse PeeringDB data and derive
  a set of defining characteristics for hypergiants. To this end, we first characterise
  the organisations present in PeeringDB, allowing us to identify discriminating properties
  of the these organisations. We then show that these properties diauerentiate hypergiants
  well from other organisations. We conclude this paper by investigating how hypergiants
  exploit the IXP ecosystem to reach the global IPv4 space.

ABS: In this paper we analyse the resilience of the Domain Name System (DNS). We study
  the impact on the availability of DNS data of certain domains for the users of the
  Internet when parts of the DNS infrastructure become unavailable. We perform our
  analysis on the level of autonomous systems and hence we explore the impact when
  an autonomous system (and all the routers, name servers and resolvers located in
  it) fails or when interconnections between autonomous systems fail. We provide a
  generic method to carry out this resilience analysis, in which we first identify
  the domain names within the analysed domain, the autonomous systems where the name
  servers and resolvers for this domain reside, and the interconnections and relations
  between these autonomous systems. Next, we simulate failure scenarios to analyse
  the impact on the reachability of autonomous systems and the corresponding DNS data
  when autonomous systems or connections between them become unavailable. Our method
  can identify bottlenecks and single points of failure that should be mitigated in
  order to improve resilience. We demonstrate our method in a case study for the .nl-domain
  and its underlying second-level domains.

ABS: Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) is one of the most destructive network attacks.
  In Socially Aware Networking (SAN), there are many problems in current detection
  methods, such as low flexibility in detecting different attacks, high false-negative
  and false-positive rates. In this paper, we propose a DDoS detection method for
  SAN based on fusion feature series forecasting. Specifically, we define a multi-protocol-fusion
  feature (MPFF) to characterize normal network flows. Moreover, we utilize the time-series
  Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) to formally describe the
  MPFF sequence, which is subsequently used in network flow forecasting and error
  calculation. Finally, we present the ARIMA detection model with error correction
  based on MPFF time series to identify DDoS in SAN. The experimental results show
  that the proposed method can effectively distinguish attacking flows from normal
  ones. Compared with previous DDoS detection methods for SAN, the proposed method
  can achieve better performance of detecting DDoS in terms of detection rate, false-positive
  rate and time delay.

ABS: Network Intrusion Detection is the process of monitoring the events occurring

  intrusions. An intrusion is a potentially harmful activity of malicious user, aimed
  at compromising the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the system. Over
  the decades intrusion detection (ID) problem has been visited by the researchers
  in various available environments like finite state automata, rule based systems,
  Markov probabilistic approach, statically sought solutions and most popular of all
  data mining and machine learning techniques. The prerequisite for data mining is
  that data should be present and there should be some hidden patterns in the data
  which need to be unearthed. In this work, we intend to provide a thorough review
  of the benchmark datasets available for Network Intrusion Detection (NID) which
  re- searchers in the field can use to train and test their models. In addition,
  this work as the first of its kind implements k -NN a simple most instance based
  type of classifier over all the datasets that doesnt require a well planed and monolithic
  training phase, across different neighborhood sizes. Results show that off all the
  datasets k -NN per- forms better on NSL-KDD dataset due to the fact that NSL-KDD

ABS: Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) allows to optimize the performance in the Internet
  by identifying the maximal packet size that can be transmitted through a network.
  Despite the central role that PMTUD plays in the Internet communication, it has
  a long history of software bugs, failures and misconfigurations. In this work we
  explore the benefits versus drawbacks of PMTUD in the Internet from the clients
  and servers perspective. First, we examine the fraction of clients that use PMTUD.
  To that end we analyse ICMP PTB messages in CAIDA Internet Traces and show that
  the fraction of networks using PMTUD is negligible and that this number is further
  decreasing over the period of 2008-2016. Second, we evaluate the fraction of popular
  web servers that support the PMTUD mechanism and show that a large number of the
  servers block ICMP packet too big messages. On the other hand, we show easy and
  efficient - even though well-known - degradation of service attacks that exploit
  the availability of PMTUD. Since the benefit of PMTUD is questionable, and in contrast
  it exposes to degradation of service attacks, we advocate to stop using it. As with
  any new change in the Internet, the implications of our recommendation should be
  carefully evaluated and gradually implemented. In the meanwhile, we provide recommendations
  for mitigations against the degradation of service attacks.

GEOLOC: Richland, WA, US
ABS: A key aspect of computer network defense and operations is the characterization
  of network behaviors. Several of these behaviors are a result of indirect interactions
  between various networked entities and are temporal in nature. Modeling them requires
  non-trivial and scalable approaches. We introduce a novel approach for characterizing
  network behaviors using significant co-occurrence discovery. A significant co-occurrence
  is a robust concurrence or coincidence of events or activities observed over a period
  of time. We formulate a network problem in the context of co-occurrence detection
  and propose an approach to detect co-occurrences in network flow information. The
  problem is a generalization of problems that are encountered in the areas of dependency
  discovery and related activity identification. Moreover, we define a set of metrics
  to determine robust characteristics of these co-occurrences. We demonstrate the
  approach, exercising it first on a simulated network trace, and second on a publicly-available
  anonymized network trace from CAIDA. We show that co-occurrences can identify interesting
  relationships and that the proposed algorithm can be an effective tool in network
  flow analysis.

ABS: The separation of control and data planes promulgated in Software-Defined Networking
  (SDN) architectures provides new opportunities for sophisticated control over the
  paths packets take while traversing the network. At the same time the complexity
  of data representing the network state continues to grow, reflecting complex topological
  and policy relationships between network elements and their domains. It is critical
  to the success of SDN to design an abstraction layer capable of storing network
  topology information and allowing to query it using standardized tools, in a way
  similar to how traditional databases enabled the abstraction of relational data.
  This abstraction would cleanly separate policy implementations in SDN controllers
  from the nuts-and-bolts of handling the topology data. In this paper we investigate
  multiple approaches to path queries in semantically-rich network descriptions using
  a variety of mechanisms. We describe a method for storing and querying semantic
  network graph data using Tarjan path algebras - to our knowledge used for the first
  time in the context of path-finding in computer networks. We compare the expressiveness
  and performance of queries that are representative of multi-domain SDN environments.

ABS: Advances in network geometry pointed out that structural properties observed
  in networks derived from real complex systems can emerge in the hyperbolic space
  (HS). The nonuniform popularity-similarity-optimization (nPSO) is a generative model
  recently introduced in order to grow random geometric graphs in the HS, reproducing
  networks that have realistic features such as high clustering, small-worldness,
  scale-freeness and rich-clubness, with the additional possibility to control the
  community organization. Generative models allowing to tune the structural properties
  of realistic synthetic networks are fundamental, because they offer a ground truth
  to investigate how predictive algorithms react to controlled topological variations.
  Here, we discuss how to leverage the nPSO model as a synthetic benchmark to compare
  the performance of methods for community detection and link prediction; and we prove
  that the nPSO offers a reliable and realistic testing framework which can complement
  other existing benchmarks not based on latent geometry. Furthermore, we confirm
  that network embedding information can improve community detection, whereas boosting
  link prediction in HS still needs further investigations. Indeed, we find that the
  presence of communities in nPSO significantly modifies the performance of link predictors
  and is fundamental for the reproducibility of results observed on real networks.
  The nPSO can trigger valuable insights to understand the intrinsic rules of link-growth
  and self-organization that connect topology to geometry and that are encoded in
  link prediction algorithms differentiating their performance.

ABS: 'Networks constitute an integral part of our lives. Both in technical and social
  contexts, they can represent connections and relationships between entities of various
  kinds, enabling a deeper analysis of the underlying structure. One of the most important
  communication networks of recent times is the Internet. Increasing second numbers
  of people use this worldwide network for manifold activities such as information
  searches, communication and commercial operations. Numerous technical applications,
  services and businesses are built based on this communication network and are therefore
  fully dependent on its functionality; for example, the World Wide Web, where social
  media and e-commerce websites belong, exerts a considerable influence on our everyday
  life and thus changes our way of thinking and acting. Additionally, the widespread
  propagation of handheld devices such as tablets and smartphones boosts the importance
  of the Internet by enabling individuals to access the mobile Internet, independently
  of location and time. In view of this, the emergence of the Internet has led to
  large changes in everyday life, which are examined in part in this dissertation.
  Overall, the present dissertation is subdivided into three areas, which build hierarchically
  on each another and are based on the traditional three dimensions of information
  systems, comprising perspectives technology, management and organization. At the
  core of this dissertation is the technological perspective, centered on an analysis
  of the Internet network using the mathematical-methodical aspect of graph theory.
  This work investigates the network and two selected applications that build on this
  communication network. The main goal is to derive insights regarding the general
  structure of the underlying network, in order to be able to understand its general
  communication functionality, detect potential bottlenecks and improve the susceptibility
  of the network to errors and deliberate attacks. The second part of the thesis deals
  with the management perspective, which focuses on econometric considerations. In
  this case, another well-known application of the Internet network is the focus of
  attention: the World Wide Web, especially e-commerce websites which have a commercial
  implication. The focus lies on the understanding and prediction of user behavior,
  with the help of methods in the area of predictive modeling. A better anticipation
  of the behavior of customers in the online context enables companies to achieve
  higher revenues, through being able to make more informed business decisions. The
  third area includes the organizational perspective, from the point of view of users
  of the Internet and its underlying applications. Here, two specific sub-areas are
  selected. The first area revolves around another type of World Wide Web application,
  social media websites, with the goal of understanding how sub-groups of users utilize
  these in different ways.'

ABS: Certificate Transparency (CT) requires that every CA-issued TLS certificate must
  be publicly logged. While a CT log need not be trusted in theory, it relies on the
  assumption that every client observes and cryptographically verifies the same log.
  As such, some form of gossip mechanism is needed in practice. Despite CT being adopted
  by several major browser vendors, no gossip mechanism is widely deployed. We suggest
  an aggregation-based gossip mechanism that passively observes cryptographic material
  that CT logs emit in plaintext, aggregating at packet processors (such as routers
  and switches) to periodically verify log consistency off-path. In other words, gossip
  is provided as-a-service by the network. Based on 20 days of RIPE Atlas measurements
  that represent clients from 3500 autonomous systems and 40 percent  of the IPv4
  space, our proposal can be deployed incrementally for a realistic threat model with
  significant protection against split-viewing CT logs. We also show that aggregation-based
  gossip can be implemented for a variety of packet processors using P4 and XDP, running
  at 10 Gbps line-speed.

ABS: In the present computer era, though the Internet-based applications are the driving
  force of social evolution, yet its architectural vulnerabilities proffer plethoric
  leisure to the attackers for conquering diversity of attacks on its services. Distributed
  Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of such prominent attack that constitutes a lethal
  threat to Internet domain that harnesses its computing and communication resources.
  Despite the presence of enormous defense solutions, ensuring the security and availability
  of data, resources, and services to end users remains an ongoing research challenge.
  In addition, the increase in network traffic rates of legitimate traffic and flow
  similarity of attack traffic with legitimate traffic has further made DDoS problem
  more crucial. The current research has deployed DDoS defense solutions primarily
  at the victim-end because of the inherent advantages of easy deployment and availability
  of complete attack information. However, the huge network traffic volume generated
  by DDoS attacks and lack of sufficient computational resources at the victim-end
  makes defense solution itself vulnerable to these attacks. This paper proposes an
  ISP level distributed, flexible, automated, and collaborative (D-FACE) defense system
  which not only distributes the computational and storage complexity to the nearest
  point of presence (PoPs) routers but also leads to an early detection of DDoS attacks
  and flash events (FEs). The results show that D-FACE defense system outperformed
  the existing Entropy-based systems on various defense system evaluation metrics.

ABS: Literature contributions have shown that information theoretic techniques can
  effectively detect various types of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
  However, such techniques are often centralized with a limited measurement vantage
  point and suffer from the issue of single point of failure. Furthermore, with the
  flourishing of distributed and cloudbased environments, such techniques ought to
  adapt to such settings for scalability and performance reasons. In this paper, we
  address the problem of collaborative DDoS detection using information-theoretic
  techniques. To this end, we propose an entropy-based detection mechanism that supports
  collaborative agreement to identify suitable tuning network parameters for distributed
  DDoS inference in real-time. Empirical evaluations with real DDoS attacks demonstrate
  that the proposed approach is indeed capable of cooperatively inferring DDoS attacks
  while achieving resiliency and scalability.

ABS: As the devices that make up the Internet become more powerful, algorithms that
  orchestrate cloud systems are on the verge of putting more responsibility for computation
  and storage on these devices. In our current age of Big Data, dissemination and
  storage of data across end cloud devices is becoming a prominent problem subject
  to this expansion. In this paper, we propose a distributed data dissemination approach
  that relies on dynamic creation/replacement/removal of replicas guided by continuous
  monitoring of data requests coming from edge nodes of the underlying network. Our
  algorithm exploits geographical locality of data during the dissemination process
  due to the plenitude of common data requests that stem from the clients within a
  close proximity. Our results using both real-world and synthetic data demonstrate
  that a decentralized replica placement approach provides significant cost benefits
  compared to client side caching that is widely used in traditional distributed systems.

ABS: During the last few years, there has been plenty of research for reducing energy
  consumption in telecommunication infrastructure. However, many of the proposals
  remain unim-plemented due to the lack of flexibility in legacy networks. In this
  paper we demonstrate how the software defined networking (SDN) capabilities of current

  In particular, we developed an ONOS application to realize an energy-aware traffic
  scheduler to a bundle link made up of Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) links between
  two SDN switches. We show how our application is able to dynamically adapt to the
  traffic characteristics and save energy by concentrating the traffic on as few ports

ABS: We propose two spectral algorithms for partitioning nodes in directed graphs
  respectively with a cyclic and an acyclic pattern of connection between groups of
  nodes. Our methods are based on the computation of extremal eigenvalues of the transition
  matrix associated to the directed graph. The two algorithms outperform state-of-the
  art methods for directed graph clustering on synthetic datasets, including methods
  based on blockmodels, bibliometric symmetrization and random walks. Our algorithms
  have the same space complexity as classical spectral clustering algorithms for undirected
  graphs and their time complexity is also linear in the number of edges in the graph.
  One of our methods is applied to a trophic network based on predator-prey relationships.
  It successfully extracts common categories of preys and predators encountered in
  food chains. The same method is also applied to highlight the hierarchical structure
  of a worldwide network of Autonomous Systems depicting business agreements between
  Internet Service Providers.

ABS: High level goals such as bandwidth provisioning, accounting and network anomaly
  detection can be easily met if high-volume traffic clusters are detected in real
  time. This paper presents Elastic Trie, an alternative to approaches leveraging
  controller-dataplane architectures.  Our solution is a novel push-based network
  monitoring approach that allows detection, within the dataplane, of high-volume
  traffic clusters. Notifications from the switch to the controller can be sent only
  as required, avoiding the transmission or processing of unnecessary data. Furthermore,
  the dataplane can iteratively refine the responsible IP prefixes allowing a controller
  to receive a flexible granularity information. We report and discuss an evaluation
  of our P4-based prototype, showing our solution to be able to detect (with 95% of
  precision), hierarchical heavy hitters and superspreaders using less than 8KB or
  80KB of active memory respectively. Finally, Elastic Trie can identify changes in
  the network traffic patterns, symptomatic of Denial-of-Service attack events.

ABS: Recently, several works conjectured the vulnerabilities of mainstream blockchains
  under several network attacks. All these attacks translate into showing that the
  assumptions of these blockchains can be violated in theory or under simulation at
  best. Unfortunately, previous results typically omit both the nature of the network
  under which the blockchain code runs and whether blockchains are private, consortium
  or public. In this paper, we study the public Ethereum blockchain as well as a consortium
  and private blockchains and quantify the feasibility of man-in-the-middle and double
  spending attacks against them. To this end, we list important properties of the
  Ethereum public blockchain topology, we deploy VMs with constrained CPU quantum
  to mimic the top-10 mining pools of Ethereum and we develop full-fledged attacks,
  that first partition the network through BGP hijacking or ARP spoofing before issuing
  a Balance Attack to steal coins. Our results demonstrate that attacking Ethereum
  is remarkably devastating in a consortium or private context as the adversary can
  multiply her digital assets by 200, 000x in 10 hours through BGP hijacking whereas
  it would be almost impossible in a public context.

ABS: "Systems that process big data (e.g., high-traffic networks and large-scale storage)
  prefer data structures and algorithms with small memory and fast processing speed.
  Efficient and fast algorithms play an essential role in system design, despite the
  improvement of hardware. This dissertation is organized around a novel algorithm
  called Othello Hashing. Othello Hashing supports ultra-fast and memory-efficient
  key-value lookup, and it fits the requirements of the core algorithms of many large-scale
  systems and big data applications. Using Othello hashing, combined with domain expertise
  in cloud, computer networks, big data, and bioinformatics, I developed the following
  applications that resolve several major challenges in the area. Concise: Forwarding
  Information Base. A Forwarding Information Base is a data structure used by the
  data plane of a forwarding device to determine the proper forwarding actions for
  packets. The polymorphic property of Othello Hashing the separation of its query
  and control functionalities, which is a perfect match to the programmable networks
  such as Software Defined Networks. Using Othello Hashing, we built a fast and scalable
  FIB named \textit{Concise}. Extensive evaluation results on three different platforms
  show that Concise outperforms other FIB designs. SDLB: Cloud Load Balancer. In a
  cloud network, the layer-4 load balancer servers is a device that acts as a reverse
  proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers.
  We built a software load balancer with Othello Hashing techniques named SDLB. SDLB
  is able to accomplish two functionalities of the SDLB using one Othello query: to
  find the designated server for packets of ongoing sessions and to distribute new
  or session-free packets. etaOthello: Taxonomic Classification of Metagenomic Sequences.
  Metagenomic read classification is a critical step in the identification and quantification
  of microbial species sampled by high-throughput sequencing. Due to the growing popularity
  of metagenomic data in both basic science and clinical applications, as well as
  the increasing volume of data being generated, efficient and accurate algorithms
  are in high demand. We built a system to support efficient classification of taxonomic
  sequences using its k-mer signatures. eqOthello: RNA-seq Sequence Search Engine.
  Advances in the study of functional genomics produced a vast supply of RNA-seq datasets.
  However, how to quickly query and extract information from sequencing resources
  remains a challenging problem and has been the bottleneck for the broader dissemination
  of sequencing efforts. The challenge resides in both the sheer volume of the data
  and its nature of unstructured representation. Using the Othello Hashing techniques,
  we built the SeqOthello sequence search engine. SeqOthello is a reference-free,
  alignment-free, and parameter-free sequence search system that supports arbitrary
  sequence query against large collections of RNA-seq experiments, which enables large-scale
  integrative studies using sequence-level data."

ABS: In this work, we examine to what extent the Internets routing infrastructure
  needlessly exposes network traffic to nations geographically irrelevant to packet
  transmission. We quantify what countries are geographically logical to see on a
  network path traveling between two nations through the use of convex hulls circumscribing
  major population centers, and then compare that to the nation states observed in
  over 14.5 billion measured paths. Our results show that 49% of paths unnecessarily
  expose traffic to at least one nation. We further explore what nations, regions,
  and ASes expose and benefit from this geographically illogical traffic. As an example,
  we see that 23% of source/destination pairs located outside of the United States
  send their traffic through the US, but only 8% of those paths are geographically
  logical. Finally, we examine what happens when countries exercise both legal and
  physical control over ASes transiting traffic, gaining access to traffic outside
  of their geographic borders, but carried by organizations that fall under a particular
  countrys legal jurisdiction. When considering both the physical and legal countries
  that a path traverses, our results show that over 57% of paths expose traffic to
  a geographically irrelevant country.

ABS: With the widespread popularity of big data usage across various applications,
  need for efficient storage, processing, and retrieval of massive datasets generated
  from different applications has become inevitable. Further, handling of these datasets
  has become one of the biggest challenges for the research community due to the involved
  heterogeneity in their formats. This can be attributed to their diverse sources
  of generation ranging from sensors to on-line transactions data and social media
  access. In this direction, probabilistic data structures (PDS) are suitable for
  large-scale data processing, approximate predictions, fast retrieval and unstructured
  data storage. In conventional databases, entire data needs to be stored in memory
  for efficient processing, but applications involving real time in-stream data demand
  time-bound query output in a single pass. Hence, this paper proposes Accommodative
  Bloom filter (ABF), a variant of scalable bloom filter, where insertion of bulk
  data is done using the addition of new filters vertically. Array of m bits is divided
  into b buckets of  bits each and new filters of size  are added to each bucket to
  accommodate the incoming data. Data generated from various sensors has been considered
  for experimental purposes where query processing is done at two levels to improve
  the accuracy and reduce the search time. It has been found that insertion and search
  time complexity of ABF does not increase with increase in number of elements. Further,
  results indicate that ABF outperforms the existing variants of Bloom filters in
  terms of false positive rates and query complexity, especially when dealing with
  in-stream data.

  effective information systems management. However, with some of the negative developments
  like DDoS attacks that impact the operations of network application systems, there
  are adverse set of issues encountered. With the rising number of DDoS attacks phenomenon,
  researchers have focused on developing contemporary solutions that can support in
  thwarting such attacks. From the review of such models in the literature review,
  it is imperative that two distinct dimensions like the detection and mitigation
  accuracy levels has scope for improvement and profoundly majority of such models
  were tested on the static datasets which are not pragmatic. Considering such equations,
  the model proposed in this manuscript focused on a contemporary range of solution
  that can be high on accuracy rate and also is tested over the dynamic dataset to
  understand the efficacy of the system. Using the ensemble classifiers comprising
  drift detection features, at service request stream level, the proposed solution
  if implemented can lead to better levels of detection. Experimental study of the
  model carried out using the service request stream that is synthesized is tested
  based on statistical metrics like accuracy, prediction value and true negative rates.
  Significance of the model is imperative in terms of results generated and its comparative
  analysis to the other bench-mark models in the segment.

ABS: New protocols for Internet inter-domain routing struggle to get widely adopted.
  Because the Internet consists of more than 50,000 autonomous systems (ASes), deployment
  of a new routing protocol has to be incremental. In this work, we study such incremental
  deployment. We first formulate the routing problem in regard to a metric of routing
  cost. Then, the paper proposes and rigorously defines a statistical notion of protocol
  ignorance that quantifies the inability of a routing protocol to accurately determine
  routing prices with respect to the metric of interest. The proposed protocol-ignorance
  model of a routing protocol is fairly generic and can be applied to routing in both
  interdomain and intradomain settings, as well as to transportation and other types
  of networks. Our model of protocol deployment makes our study specific to Internet
  inter- domain routing. Through a combination of mathematical analysis and simulation,
  we demonstrate that the benefits from adopting a new inter-domain protocol accumulate
  smoothly during its incremental deployment. In particular, the simulation shows
  that decreasing the routing price by 25% requires between 43% and 53% of all nodes
  to adopt the new protocol. Our findings elucidate the deployment struggle of new
  inter-domain routing protocols and indicate that wide deployment of such a protocol
  necessitates involving a large number of relevant ASes into a coordinated effort
  to adopt the new protocol.

ABS: Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) is a rapidly growing problem with the fast
  development of the Internet. There are multitude DDoS detection approaches, however,
  three major problems about DDoS attack detection appear in the big data environment.
  Firstly, to shorten the respond time of the DDoS attack detector ; secondly, to
  reduce the required compute resources ; lastly, to achieve a high detection rate
  with low false alarm rate. In the paper, we propose an abnormal network fl ow feature
  sequence prediction approach which could fit to be used as a DDoS attack detector
  in the big data environment and solve aforementioned problems. We define a network
  flow abnormal index as PDRA with the percentage of old IP addresses, the increment
  of the new IP addresses, the ratio of new IP addresses to the old IP addresses and
  average accessing rate of each new IP address. We design an IP address database
  using sequential storage model which has a constant time complexity. The autoregressive
  in tegrated moving average (ARIMA) trending prediction module will be started if
  and only if the number of continuous PDRA sequence value, which all exceed an PDRA
  abnormal threshold (PAT), reaches a certain preset threshold. And then calculate
  the probability that is the percentage of forecasting PDRA sequence value which
  exceed the PAT. Finally we identify the DDoS attack based on the abnormal probability
  of the forecasting PDRA sequence. Both theorem and experiment show that the method
  we proposed can effectively reduce the compute resources consumption, identify DDoS
  attack at its initial stage with higher detection rate and lower false alarm rate

ABS: 'Today network operators spend a significant amount of time struggling to understand
  how their network forwards traffic. Even simple questions such as How is my network
  handling Google traffic? often require operators to manually bridge large semantic
  gaps between low level forwarding rules distributed across many routers and the
  corresponding high-level insights. We introduce Net2Text, a system which assists
  network operators in reasoning about network-wide forwarding behaviors. Out of the
  raw forwarding state and a query expressed in natural language, Net2Text automatically
  produces succinct summaries, also in natural language, which efficiently capture
  network-wide semantics. Our key insight is to pose the problem of summarizing (captioning)
  the network forwarding state as an optimization problem that aims to balance coverage,
  by describing as many paths as possible, and explainability, by maximizing the information
  provided. As this problem is NP-hard, we also propose an approximation algorithm
  which generates summaries based on a sample of the forwarding state, with marginal
  loss of quality. We implemented Net2Text and demonstrated its practicality and scalability.
  We show that Net2Text generates high-quality interpretable summaries of the entire
  forwarding state of hundreds of routers with full routing tables, in few seconds

ABS: Today the Internet plays a critical role in our lives; we rely on it for communication,
  business, and more recently, smart home operations. Users expect high performance
  and availability of the Internet. To meet such high demands, all Internet components
  including routing must operate at peak efficiency. However, events that hamper the
  routing system over the Internet are very common, causing millions of dollars of
  financial loss, traffic exposed to attacks, or even loss of national connectivity.
  Moreover, there is sparse real-time detection and reporting of such events for the
  public. A key challenge in addressing such issues is lack of methodology to study,
  evaluate and characterize Internet connectivity. While many networks operating autonomously
  have made the Internet robust, the complexity in understanding how users interconnect,
  interact and retrieve content has also increased. Characterizing how data is routed,
  measuring dependency on external networks, and fast outage detection has become
  very necessary using public measurement infrastructures and data sources. From a
  regulatory standpoint, there is an immediate need for systems to detect and report
  routing events where a content providers routing policies may run afoul of state
  policies. In this dissertation, we design, build and evaluate systems that leverage
  existing infrastructure and report routing events in near-real time. In particular,
  we focus on geographic routing anomalies i.e., detours, routing failure i.e., outages,
  and measuring structural changes in routing policies.

  and efficient feature extraction method for constructing vector embeddings for representing
  autonomous systems (ASes) in Internet data analysis. AS2Vec can efficiently generate
  meaningful n-dimensional feature vectors that capture global connectivity properties
  of ASes using only a single resource for network data. We demonstrated, through
  machine learning tasks, that these feature vectors contain distinctive patterns
  which preserve structural equivalence and class separability among ASes, facilitating
  accurate predictions on an imbalanced AS classification problem. This may bring
  us one step closer towards realizing a knowledge-defined network as predictive analytics
  seamlessly integrates into network operations and management systems.

ABS: It has been claimed that the deployment of fog and edge computing infrastructure
  is a necessity to make high-performance cloud-based applications a possibility.
  However, there are a large number of middle-ground latency-sensitive applications
  such as online gaming, interactive photo editing and multimedia conferencing that
  require servers deployed closer to users than in globally centralised clouds but
  do not necessarily need the extreme low-latency provided by a new infrastructure
  of micro data centres located at the network edge, e.g. in base stations and ISP
  Points of Presence. In this paper we analyse a snapshot of todays data centres and

ABS: In OpenFlow-based Software-Defined Networks, obtaining flow-level measurements,
  similar to those provided by NetFlow/IPFIX, is challenging as it requires to install
  an entry per flow in the flow tables. This approach does not scale well as the number
  of entries in the flow tables is limited and small. Moreover, labeling the flows
  with the application that generates the traffic would greatly enrich these reports,
  as it would provide very valuable information for network performance and security
  among others. In this paper, we present a scalable flow monitoring solution fully
  compatible with current off-the-shelf OpenFlow switches. Measurements are maintained
  in the switches and are asynchronously sent to a SDN controller. Additionally, flows
  are classified using a combination of DPI and Machine Learning (ML) techniques with
  special focus on the identification of web and encrypted traffic. For the sake of
  scalability, we designed two different traffic sampling methods depending on the
  OpenFlow features available in the switches. We implemented our monitoring solution
  within OpenDaylight and evaluated it in a testbed with Open vSwitch, using also
  a number of DPI and ML tools to find the best tradeoff between accuracy and performance.
  Our experimental results using real-world traffic show that the measurement and
  classification systems are accurate and the cost to deploy them is significantly
  reduced.

ABS: Censorship circumvention is often characterized as a cat-and-mouse game between
  a nation-state censor and the developers of censorship resistance systems. Decoy
  routing systems offer a solution to censor- ship resistance that has the potential
  to tilt this race in the favour of the censorship resistor by using real connections
  to unblocked, overt sites to deliver censored content to users. This is achieved
  by employing the help of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or Autonomous Systems
  (ASes) that own routers in the middle of the net- work. However, the deployment
  of decoy routers has yet to reach fruition. Obstacles to deployment such as the
  heavy requirements on routers that deploy decoy router relay stations, and the impact
  on the quality of service for customers that pass through these routers have deterred
  potential participants from deploying existing systems. Furthermore, connections
  from clients to overt sites often follow different paths in the upstream and downstream
  direction, making some existing designs impractical. Although decoy routing systems
  that lessen the burden on participating routers and accommodate asymmetric flows
  have been proposed, these arguably more deployable systems suffer from security
  vulnerabilities that put their users at risk of discovery or make them prone to
  censorship or denial of service attacks. In this paper, we propose a technique for
  supporting route asymmetry in previously symmetric decoy routing systems. The resulting
  asymmetric solution is more secure than previous asymmetric proposals and provides
  an option for tiered deployment, allowing more cautious ASes to deploy a lightweight,
  non-blocking relay station that aids in defending against routing-capable adversaries.
  We also provide an experimental evaluation of relay station performance on off-the-shelf
  hardware and additional security improvements to recently proposed systems.

ABS: In the development of Internet of Things (IoT), network security has received
  increasing attention. Many network attacks are performed through the sensors. Among
  the various cyberattacks, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks represent
  one of the most serious types. DDoS attacks should not be underestimated in terms
  of the loss they may cause. In this study, we integrated Apache Spark, a big-data
  computing framework, with a detection model based on a back-propagation artificial
  neural network. Thanks to the capacity of a big-data computing framework for mass
  historical data, computation of the characteristics required for the learning of
  the detection model can be performed in a real-time manner. An artificial neural
  network model is perfect for DDoS detection, owing to its good scalability and its
  advantage of restricting the expansion of computing resources consumed as data volume
  increases. This eliminates the problems related to traditional approaches to DDoS
  signature computing, where mass data can take considerable time to compute and can
  even overwhelm a system. The results of this study show that the trained artificial
  neural network achieved a detection rate as high as 99.80% and the real-time detection
  system achieved a detection rate of 87.18%. Compared with other studies in this
  field, it is clear that the proposed approach provides effective detection of DDoS
  attacks, and that the incorporation of Apache Spark, the open-source clustering
  big-data computing framework, allows more computers and more Kafka Producers receiving
  packets to be used to form an even larger detection system capable of dealing with
  increasingly huge and diverse DDoS attacks.

ABS: In smart manufacturing, production machinery and auxiliary devices, referred
  to as industrial Internet of things (IIoT), are connected to a unified networking
  infrastructure for management and command deliveries in a precise production process.
  However, providing autonomous, reliable, and real-time offloaded services for such
  a production is an open challenge since these IIoT devices are assumed lightweight
  embedded platforms with limited computing performance. In this paper, we propose
  a pattern-identified online task scheduling (PIOTS) mechanism for the networking
  infrastructure, where multitier edge computing is provided, in order to handle the
  offloaded tasks in real time. First, historical IIoT task patterns in every timeslot
  are used to train a self-organizing map (SOM), which represents the features of
  the task patterns within defined dimensions. Consequently, offline task scheduling
  among edge computing-enabled entities is performed on the set of all SOM neurons
  using the Hungarian method to determine the expected optimal task assignments. In
  real-time context, whenever a task arrives at the infrastructure, the expected optimal
  assignment for the task is scheduled to the appropriate edge computing-enabled entity.
  Numerical simulation results show that the proposed PIOTS mechanism overcomes existing
  solutions in terms of computation performance and service capability.

GEOLOC: Lancaster, UK; Glasgow, UK; Lancaster, UK
ABS: Undoubtedly, the characterisation of network traffic flows is vitally important
  in understanding the dynamics of Internet traffic and in appropriately dimensioning
  network resources for network and systems management. The vast majority of modelling
  techniques developed for volume-based traffic profiling (based on packet and/byte
  counts) imply the statistical assumptions of stationarity, Gaussianity and linearity,
  which are often taken for granted without being explicitly validated. In this paper,
  we demonstrate that such properties are often not applicable due to the high fluctuations
  in Internet traffic, and should therefore be validated first before they are assumed.
  We employ Time-Frequency (TF) representations and the Hinich algorithms for validating
  these three modelling assumptions on real backbone and edge network traces. We show
  by conducting a passive, offline statistical analysis on real operational network
  traffic traces from both backbone and edge links that link traffic is extremely
  dynamic irrespective of the level of aggregation and that model characteristics
  vary. Subsequently, we propose the use of a representative of higher order spectra,
  the bispectrum, to act as a particularly suitable method for volume-based traffic
  profiling due to its ability to adapt to different underlying statistical assumptions,
  as opposed to ARIMA timeseries models that have been typically used in the literature.
  We demonstrate that the bispectrum, a signal processing tool that has so far been
  used in the area of image processing and acoustic signals, can be exploited to accurately
  characterise traffic volumes per transport protocol, and can therefore contribute
  to fine-grained network operations tasks such as application classification and
  anomaly detection.

ABS: Lots of studies about the Internet Autonomous System (AS) level topology have
  been carried out during the last twenty years, most of them analyzing this topology
  on a world-wide scale, a lot of them based on routing information from the Border
  Gateway Protocol (BGP). However, studies focusing on a specific region and making
  comparisons between regions are not that popular and in fact, most world-wide studies
  are not valid in some particular regions. This work is targeting this particular
  problem of the regional or country topology analysis by enhancing regular AS-level
  graphs where to apply different connectivity metrics. The focus is set on Latin
  America and the Caribbean (the LAC region) which exhibits appropriate conditions
  for this type of analysis and where we show that a basic metric comparison may not
  be good enough so as to realize that there is a connectivity problem in the region.
  After concluding that the situation in the LAC region in terms of interconnection
  is even worse than expected, we perform some country-level studies finding correlations
  between graph characteristics and some socioeconomic indicators. We then use these
  correlations to identify countries in which it would be worth pushing for the deployment
  of an Internet Exchange Point (IXP), as simulating the creation of an IXP there
  has a great impact on the interconnection level and on the robustness of the regional
  Internet.

  network. We show the work done by multiple researchers in the past, where social

ABS: Fine-grained traffic flow records enable many powerful applications, especially
  in combination with telemetry systems that supports high coverage, i.e., of every
  link and at all times. Current solutions, however, make undesirable trade-offs between
  infrastructure cost and information richness. Switches that generate flow records,
  e.g., NetFlow switches, are a low cost solution but current designs sacrifice information
  richness, e.g., by sampling. Information rich alternatives rely heavily on servers,
  which increases cost to the point that they are impractical for high coverage. In
  this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of TurboFlow,
  a flow record generator for programmable switches that does not compromise on either
  cost or information richness. TurboFlow produces fine- grained and unsampled flow
  records with custom features entirely at the switch without relying on any support
  from external servers. This is a challenge given high traffic rates and the limitations
  of switch hardware. To overcome, we decompose the flow record generation algorithm
  and optimize it for the heterogeneous processors in programmable switches. We show
  that with this design, TurboFlow can support multi-terabit workloads on readily
  available commodity switches to enable information rich monitoring with high coverage.

ABS: Cloud Computing enables providers to rent out space on their virtual and physical
  infrastructures. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks threaten the ability of the cloud
  to respond to clients requests, which results in considerable economic losses. The
  existing detection approaches are still not mature enough to satisfy a cloud-based
  detection systems requirements since they overlook the changing/dynamic environment,
  that characterises the cloud as a result of its inherent characteristics. Indeed,
  the patterns extracted and used by the existing detection models to identify attacks,
  are limited to the current VMs infrastructure but do not necessarily hold after
  performing new adjustments according to the pay-as-you-go business model. Therefore,
  the accuracy of detection will be negatively affected. Motivated by this fact, we
  present a new approach for detecting DoS attacks in a virtualized cloud under changing
  environment. The proposed model enables monitoring and quantifying the effect of
  resources adjustments on the collected data. This helps filter out the effect of
  adjustments from the collected data and thus enhance the detection accuracy in dynamic
  environments. Our solution correlates as well VMs application metrics with the actual
  resources load, which enables the hypervisor to distinguish between benignant high
  load and DoS attacks. It helps also the hypervisor identify the compromised VMs
  that try to needlessly consume more resources. Experimental results show that our
  model is able to enhance the detection accuracy under changing environments.

ABS: As an emerging threat, link flooding attacks (LFAs) target and congest core links
  that constitute Internet routing infrastructure, hence posing a growing threat to
  networks worldwide. Mitigating and defeating LFAs is particularly challenging for
  two reasons. First, arising from the end-to-end communication from bots to public
  servers (e.g., Web servers), the attack traffic flows could be indistinguishable
  from legitimate ones, and even unobservable to the victim network surrounded by
  the target links. Therefore, typical flow-filtering countermeasures deployed at
  the network perimeter become invalid when handling LFAs. Second, the target link
  and the victim network belong to an autonomous system (AS) different from the source
  ASs where the attack traffic flows originate. These source ASs, however, have no
  idea the target link is under attack, whereas they are in charge of routing decisions
  and thus capable of mitigating LFAs by rerouting the attack traffic flows to bypass
  the target link. Therefore, inter-AS cooperation is indispensable to defeat LFAs.
  Unfortunately, the source ASs lack incentives to cooperate because the collateral
  damage of LFAs to them may be negligible, making it challenging to eradicate LFAs.
  In this paper, we make the first effort to cope with LFAs from a techno-economic
  perspective, for accelerating ISPs cooperation in defending against LFAs. We propose
  two novel mechanisms to mitigate LFAs by stimulating the inter-AS cooperation via
  incentive design and Nash bargaining. Experiments using Internet AS relationship
  data demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our mechanisms.

ABS: The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the current state-of-the-art inter-domain
  routing between Autonomous Systems (ASes). Although BGP has different mechanisms
  to manage outbound traffic in an AS domain, it lacks an efficient tool for inbound
  traffic control from transit ASes such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs). For
  inter-domain routing, the BGPs destination-based forwarding paradigm limits the
  granularity of distributing the network traffic among the multiple paths of the
  current Internet topology. Thus, this work offered a new architecture to manage
  incoming traffic in the inter-domain using OpenFlow networks. The architecture explored
  direct inter-domain communication to exchange control information and the functionalities
  of the OpenFlow protocol. Based on the achieved results of the size of exchanging
  messages, the proposed architecture is not only scalable, but also capable of performing
  load balancing for inbound traffic using different strategies.

  of the companies owning each router. We find a high level of information exposure;
  even physically adjacent countries use routes that involve many other countries.
  We also found that countries that are well connected tend to be more exposed. Our

ABS: Many network monitoring tasks identify subsets of traffic that stand out, e.g.,
  top-k flows for a particular statistic. A Protocol Independent Switch Architecture
  (PISA) switch can identify these heavy hitter flows directly in the data plane,
  by aggregating traffic statistics across packets and comparing against a threshold.
  However, network operators often want to identify interesting traffic on a network-wide
  basis. To bridge the gap between line-rate monitoring and network-wide visibility,
  we present a distributed heavy-hitter detection scheme for networks modeled as one-big
  switch. We use adaptive thresholds to perform efficient threshold monitoring directly
  in the data plane. We implement our system using the P4 language, and evaluate it
  using real-world packet traces. We demonstrate that our solution can accurately
  detect network-wide heavy hitters with up to 70% savings in communication overhead
  compared to an existing approach with a provable upper bound.

ABS: Many network functions are moving from hardware to software to get better programmability
  and lower cost. Measurement is critical to most network functions because getting
  detailed information about traffic is often the first step to make control decisions
  and diagnose problems. The key challenge for measurement is how to keep a large
  number of counters while processing packets at line rate. Previous work on measurement
  algorithms mostly focuses on reducing memory usage while achieving high accuracy.
  However, software servers have plenty of memory but incur new challenges of achieving
  both high performance and high accuracy. In this paper, we revisit the measurement
  algorithms and data structures under the new metrics of performance and accuracy.
  We show that saving memory through extra computation is not worthwhile. As a result,
  a linear hash table and count array outperform more complex data structures such
  as Cuckoo hashing, Count-Min sketches, and heaps in a variety of scenarios.

ABS: Existing distributed denial-of-service attack detection in software defined networks
  (SDNs) typically perform detection in a single domain. In reality, abnormal traffic
  usually affects multiple network domains. Thus, a cross-domain attack detection
  has been proposed to improve detection performance. However, when participating
  in detection, the domain of each SDN needs to provide a large amount of real traffic
  data, from which private information may be leaked. Existing multiparty privacy
  protection schemes often achieve privacy guarantees by sacrificing accuracy or increasing
  the time cost. Achieving both high accuracy and reasonable time consumption is a
  challenging task. In this paper, we propose Predis, which is a privacy-preserving
  cross-domain attack detection scheme for SDNs. Predis combines perturbation encryption
  and data encryption to protect privacy and employs a computationally simple and
  efficient algorithm k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) as its detection algorithm. We also
  improve kNN to achieve better efficiency. Via theoretical analysis and extensive
  simulations, we demonstrate that Predis is capable of achieving efficient and accurate
  attack detection while securing sensitive information of each domain.

ABS: Malicious software events are usually stealthy and thus challenging to detect.
  A triggering relation can be assumed to be causal and to create a temporal relation-
  ship between the events. For example, in a spoofed TCP DDoS flooding attack, the
  attacker manipulates a three- way handshake procedure. During this attack, the number
  of spoofed IP addresses and the number of open ports used by the attacker follow
  a causal relationship. This pa- per demonstrates the effectiveness of Granger Causality
  in confirming TCP flooding attacks. We focus on discovering the presence of TCP-SYN
  flooding DDoS activity in network traffic by analyzing causal information in near
  real time.

ABS: Using Autonomous System (AS) level Internet topology maps to determine accurate
  AS-level paths is essential for network diagnostics, performance optimization, security
  enforcement, business policy management and topology-aware application development.
  One significant drawback that we have observed in many studies is simplifying the
  AS-level topology map of the Internet to an undirected graph, and then using the
  hop distance as a means to find the shortest paths between the ASes. A less significant
  drawback is restricting the shortest paths to only valley-free paths. Both approaches
  usually inflate the number of paths between ASes; introduce erroneous paths that
  do not conform to economic policies; and generate symmetric paths, which in reality
  is not a rule. As a result, the derived conclusions might be greatly misleading.
  In this study we introduce a single-destination, policy-preferred path enumeration
  algorithm which discovers policy consistent paths from all ASes to a destination
  AS in an edge-labeled, finite, directed graph representing the Internet topology.
  Considering that our algorithms run time complexity is the same as Dijkstras shortest
  paths algorithm, we believe that the proposed algorithm will notably enhance the
  future works that leverage AS-to-AS paths in Internet topology graphs.

ABS: Technological advances and innovative business models led to the modernization
  of the cyber-physical concept with the realization of the Internet of Things (IoT).
  While IoT envisions a plethora of high impact benefits in both, the consumer as
  well as the control automation markets, unfortunately, security concerns continue
  to be an afterthought. Several technical challenges impede addressing such security
  requirements, including, lack of empirical data related to various IoT devices in
  addition to the shortage of actionable attack signatures. In this paper, we present
  what we believe is a first attempt ever to comprehend the severity of IoT maliciousness
  by empirically characterizing the magnitude of Internet-scale IoT exploitations.
  We draw upon unique and extensive darknet (passive) data and develop an algorithm
  to infer unsolicited IoT devices which have been compromised and are attempting
  to exploit other Internet hosts. We further perform correlations by leveraging active
  Internet-wide scanning to identify and report on such IoT devices and their hosting
  environments. The generated results indicate a staggering 11 thousand exploited
  IoT devices that are currently in the wild. Moreover, the outcome pinpoints that
  IoT devices embedded deep in operational Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) such as manufacturing
  plants and power utilities are the most compromised. We concur that such results
  highlight the wide-spread insecurities of the IoT paradigm, while the actionable
  generated inferences are postulated to be leveraged for prompt mitigation as well
  as to facilitate IoT forensic investigations using real empirical data.

  annealing (SA) algorithm to find a near-optimal configuration of the coupling links,
  which effectively improves the overall traffic capacity compared with random, assortative,
  and disassortative couplings. Furthermore, we investigate the optimal configuration
  of coupling links given by the SA algorithm and develop a faster method to select

ABS: Nowadays, enterprises widely deploy Network Functions (NFs) and server applications
  in the cloud. However, processing of sensitive data and trusted execution cannot
  be securely deployed in the untrusted cloud. Cloud providers themselves could accidentally
  leak private information (e.g., due to misconfigurations) or rogue users could exploit
  vulnerabilities of the providers systems to compromise execution integrity, posing
  a threat to the confidentiality of internal enterprise and customer data. In this
  paper, we identify (i) a number of NF and server application use-cases that trusted
  execution can be applied to, (ii) the assets and impact of compromising the private
  data and execution integrity of each use-case, and (iii) we leverage Intels Software
  Guard Extensions (SGX) architecture to design Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
  for cloud-based NFs and server applications. We combine SGX with the Data Plane
  Development KIT (DPDK) to prototype and evaluate our TEEs for a number of application
  scenarios (Layer 2 frame and Layer 3 packet processing for plain and encrypted traffic,
  traffic load-balancing and back-end server processing). Our results indicate that
  NFs involving plain traffic can achieve almost native performance (e.g., ~22 Million
  Packets Per Second for Layer 3 forwarding for 64-byte frames), while NFs involving
  encrypted traffic and server processing can still achieve competitive performance
  (e.g., ~12 Million Packets Per Second for server processing for 64-byte frames).

ABS: IP source address spoofing is regarded as one of the most prevalent components
  when launching an anonymous invasion, especially a Distributed Denial-of-Service
  (DDoS) attack. Although Source Address Validations (SAVs) at the access network
  level are standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), SAV at the
  inter-Autonomous System (AS) level still remains an important issue. To prevent
  routing hijacking, the IETF is constructing a Resource Public Key Infrastructure
  (RPKI) as a united trust anchor to secure interdomain routing. In this study, we
  creatively use the RPKI to support inter-AS SAV and propose an RPKI-based Inter-AS
  Source Protection (RISP) mechanism. According to the trust basis provided by the
  RPKI, RISP offers ASes a more credible source-oriented protection for the IP addresses
  they own and remains independent of the RPKI. Based on the experiments with real
  Internet topology, RISP not only provides better incentives, but also improves efficacy
  and economizes bandwidth with a modest resource consumption.

ABS: IP lookup is a core operation in packet forwarding, which is implemented using
  a Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) algorithm to find the next hop for an input address.
  This work proposes and evaluates the use of parallel processors to deploy an optimized
  IP lookup algorithm based on Bloom filters. We target the implementation on the
  Intel Xeon Phi (Intel Phi) many-core coprocessor and on multi-core CPUs, and also
  evaluate the cooperative execution using both computing devices with several optimizations.
  The experimental evaluation shows that we were able to attain high IP lookup throughputs
  of up to 182.7 Mlps (Million packets per second) for IPv6 packets on a single Intel
  Phi. This performance indicates that the Intel Phi is a very promising platform
  for deployment of IP lookup. We also compared the Bloom filters to an efficient
  approach based on the Multi-Index Hybrid Trie (MIHT) in which the Bloom filters
  was up to 5.1 x faster. We also propose and evaluate the cooperative use of CPU
  and Intel Phi in the IP lookup, which resulted in an improvement of about 1.3 x
  as compared to the execution using only the Intel Phi.

GEOLOC: Cambridge, MA, US
ABS: This paper develops a technique to detect whether the cross traffic competing
  with a flow is elastic or not, and shows how to use the elasticity detector to improve
  congestion control. If the cross traffic is elastic, i.e., made up of flows like
  Cubic or NewReno that increase their rate when they perceive available bandwidth,
  then one should use a scheme that competes well with such traffic. Such a scheme
  will not be able to control delays because the cross traffic will not cooperate
  to maintain low delays. If, however, cross traffic is inelastic, then one can use
  a suitable delay-controlled algorithm. Our elasticity detector uses an asymmetric
  sinusoidal pulse pattern and estimates elasticity by computing the frequency response
  (FFT) of the cross traffic estimate; we have measured its accuracy to be over 90%.
  We present the design and evaluation of Nimbus, a congestion control protocol that
  uses the elasticity detector to switch between delay-control and TCP-competitive
  modes. Our results on emulated and real-world paths show that Nimbus achieves throughput
  comparable to or better than Cubic always, but with delays that are much lower when
  cross traffic is inelastic. Unlike BBR, Nimbus is fair to Cubic, and has significantly
  lower delay by 40-50 ms. Compared to Copa, which also switches between a delay-controlling
  and a TCP-competitive mode, Nimbus is more robust at correctly detecting the nature
  of cross traffic, and unlike Copa, it is usable by a variety of delay-based and
  TCP-competitive methods.

ABS: Denial of service attacks pose a threat in constant growth. This is mainly due
  to their tendency to gain in sophistication, ease of implementation, obfuscation
  and the recent improvements in occultation of fingerprints. On the other hand, progress
  towards self-organizing networks, and the different techniques involved in their
  development, such as software-defined networking, network-function virtualization,
  artificial intelligence or cloud computing, facilitates the design of new defensive
  strategies, more complete, consistent and able to adapt the defensive deployment
  to the current status of the network. In order to contribute to their development,
  in this paper, the use of artificial immune systems to mitigate denial of service
  attacks is proposed. The approach is based on building networks of distributed sensors
  suited to the requirements of the monitored environment. These components are capable
  of identifying threats and reacting according to the behavior of the biological
  defense mechanisms in human beings. It is accomplished by emulating the different
  immune reactions, the establishment of quarantine areas and the construction of
  immune memory. For their assessment, experiments with public domain datasets (KDD99,
  CAIDA07 and CAIDA08) and simulations on various network configurations based on
  traffic samples gathered by the University Complutense of Madrid and flooding attacks
  generated by the tool DDoSIM were performed.

ABS: Modern low-latency anonymity systems, no matter whether constructed as an overlay
  or implemented at the network layer, offer limited security guarantees against traffic
  analysis. On the other hand, high-latency anonymity systems offer strong security
  guarantees at the cost of computational overhead and long delays, which are excessive
  for interactive applications. We propose TARANET, an anonymity system that implements
  protection against traffic analysis at the network layer, and limits the incurred
  latency and overhead. In TARANETs setup phase, traffic analysis is thwarted by mixing.
  In the data transmission phase, end hosts and ASes coordinate to shape traffic into
  constant-rate transmission using packet splitting. Our prototype implementation
  shows that TARANET can forward anonymous traffic at over 50~Gbps using commodity
  hardware.

ABS: The global communication infrastructure of the Internet is formed by tens of
  thousands of Autonomous Systems (ASes) connecting various organizations and individuals
  together. In the last two decades researchers have developed many techniques to
  infer the topology of individual ASes as well as the whole Internet at the interface,
  router, subnet, point of presence and AS levels. In this study we extend the AS
  level Internet topology maps by introducing cross-AS (X-AS) topology maps. X-AS
  maps capture both ASes and cross connections between the ASes observed at the network
  layer. We propose a set of techniques to infer X-AS topology maps by employing datasets
  obtained through common tools such as traceroute, ping and BGP data collectors.
  X-AS maps allow us to go beyond the simple AS level graphs and abstract the topology
  of the Internet as a multigraph supporting multiple connections among the ASes.
  We verify the proof of concept using several research and commercial networks and
  investigate various features of the Internets X-AS map and its multigraph representation.
  We believe that X-AS Internet topology maps will allow us to (i) gain further insight
  into the structural and operational characteristics of the Internet; (ii) enhance
  current and future IP stack protocols; (iii) optimize networking infrastructures;
  and (iv) improve synthetic network generators and simulation tools.

ABS: With exponential growth in the size of computer networks and developed applications,
  the significant increasing of the potential damage that can be caused by launching
  attacks is becoming obvious. Meanwhile, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and Intrusion
  Prevention Systems (IPSs) are one of the most important defense tools against the
  sophisticated and ever-growing network attacks. Due to the lack of adequate dataset,
  anomaly-based approaches in intrusion detection systems are suffering from accurate
  deployment, analysis and evaluation. There exist a number of such datasets such
  as DARPA98, KDD99, ISC2012, and ADFA13 that have been used by the researchers to
  evaluate the performance of their proposed intrusion detection and intrusion prevention
  approaches. Based on our study over eleven available datasets since 1998, many such
  datasets are out of date and unreliable to use. Some of these datasets suffer from
  lack of traffic diversity and volumes, some of them do not cover the variety of
  attacks, while others anonymized packet information and payload which cannot reflect
  the current trends, or they lack feature set and metadata. This paper produces a
  reliable dataset that contains benign and seven common attack network flows, which
  meets real world criteria and is publicly available. Consequently, the paper evaluates
  the performance of a comprehensive set of network traffic features and machine learning
  algorithms to indicate the best set of features for detecting the certain attack

ABS: The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the Internets default inter-domain routing
  protocol that manages connectivity among Autonomous Systems (ASes). BGP is an incremental
  protocol where, after the initial transfer of a full routing table, BGP traffic
  to peers should only reflect underlying topology or traffic engineering changes.
  Unfortunately, most BGP traffic consists of announcements, updates and withdrawals
  unrelated to any underlying network management goals. We define such BGP traffic
  as unstable BGP traffic as long as it does not disseminate the business relationship
  between Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or threaten BGP operation. We define ASes
  that originate unstable BGP traffic as unstable ASes. BGP was developed at a time
  when information provided by an AS was assumed to be accurate. Although many attempts
  have been made to improve its security, BGP is still vulnerable to different types
  of anomalous events. BGP anomalies are rare but can cause great damage when they
  occur. The consequences of these anomalies can range from a single to thousands
  of anomalous BGP updates. These consequences have threatened Internet performance
  and reliability. Identifying BGP anomalies is a challenging task where BGP traffic
  has been characterised to be noisy, voluminous, and complex. Furthermore, unstable
  BGP traffic has the effect of masking anomalous traffic. Recent statistics and trends
  of BGP anomalies show approximately 20% of BGP anomalies lasted less than 10 minutes
  but were able to pollute 90% of the Internet in less than 2 minutes. These statistics
  demonstrate the need for rapid detection of BGP anomalies. Early detection of BGP
  anomalies enables network operators to protect their network from the worst consequence
  of the anomalous behaviour and helps to improve Internet stability. Current approaches
  tend to be slow and require substantial historical data. To overcome these challenges,
  this thesis proposes a novel scheme to detect BGP anomalies based on Recurrence
  Quantification Analysis (RQA). RQA is an advanced non-linear statistical analysis
  technique using phase space concepts. RQA can identify BGP anomalies rapidly. RQA
  can also identify abnormal hidden behaviour in the underlying BGP traffic that may
  otherwise pass without observation. Using the past and emulated BGP anomalies, we
  demonstrate that RQA can detect BGP anomalies within 62 seconds using 1200 seconds
  of historical BGP updates.

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a serious threat on todays Internet.
  As the traffic across the Internet increases day by day, it is a challenge to distinguish
  between legitimate and malicious traffic. This thesis proposes two different approaches
  to build an efficient DDoS attack detection system in the Software Defined Networking
  environment. SDN is the latest networking approach which implements centralized
  controller, which is programmable. The central control and the programming capability
  of the controller are used in this thesis to implement the detection and mitigation
  mechanisms. In this thesis, two designed approaches, statistical approach and machine-learning
  approach, are proposed for the DDoS detection. The statistical approach implements
  entropy computation and flow statistics analysis. It uses the mean and standard
  deviation of destination entropy, new flow arrival rate, packets per flow and flow
  duration to compute various thresholds. These thresholds are then used to distinguish
  normal and attack traffic. The machine learning approach uses Random Forest classifier
  to detect the DDoS attack. We fine-tune the Random Forest algorithm to make it more
  accurate in DDoS detection. In particular, we introduce the weighted voting instead
  of the standard majority voting to improve the accuracy. Our result shows that the
  proposed machine learning approach outperforms the statistical approach. Furthermore,
  it also outperforms other machine-learning approach found in the literature

ABS: The detection of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks based on internet
  traffic anomalies is a method which is general in nature and can detect unknown
  or zero-day attacks. One of the statistical characteristics used for thicurity equipment.
  In this paper, we propose a new, two-step method for detection of DDoS attacks.
  This method combines the approaches of network traffic entropy and the TakagiSugeno-Kang
  fuzzy system. In the first step, the detection process calculates the entropy distribution
  of the network packets. In the second step, the TakagiSugeno-Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS)
  method is applied to these entropy values. The performance of the TSK-FS method
  is compared with that of the typically used approach, in which cumulative sum (CUSUM)
  change point detection is applied directly to entropy time series. The results show
  that the TSK-FS DDoS detector reaches enhanced sensitivity and robustness in the
  detection process, achieving a high true-positive detection rate and a very low
  false-positive rate. As it is based on entropy, this combined method retains its
  generality and is capable of detecting various types of attack

TOPKEY: topology-ark-ipv4-traceroute
GEOLOC: College Park, MD, US
ABS: Active Internet measurement relies on responses to active probes such as ICMP
  Echo Request or TCP SYN messages. Active Internet measurement is very useful in
  that it enables researchers to measure the Internet without privileged data from
  ISPs. Researchers use active measurement to study Internet topology, route dynamics
  and link bandwidth by sending many packets through selected links, and measure RTTs
  and reliability through probing many addresses. A fundamental challenge in active
  measurement design is in allocating and limiting measurement traffic by carefully
  choosing where measurements are sent and how many samples are taken per measurement.
  It is important to minimize measurement loads because heavy measurement traffic
  may appear malicious. If network operators consider measurement traffic as attacks,
  then they can blacklist the sources of measurement traffic and thus affect the completeness
  and accuracy of the measurement. Another challenge of active measurement is that
  biases can occur due to no responses from or biased selection of destinations. Biases
  can cause misleading conclusions and thus should be minimized. In this dissertation,
  I develop a general approach to reducing measurement loads and biases of active
  Internet measurement based on the insight that they can be reduced by letting Internet
  addresses represent larger aggregates. I first develop a technique that identifies
  and aggregates topologically proximate addresses. The technique called Hobbit compares
  traceroute results to measure topological proximity. Hobbit deals with load-balanced
  paths that can cause incorrect inferences of topological proximity by distinguishing
  between route differences due to load balancing and due to distinct route entries.
  Hobbit also makes a unique contribution that it can aggregate even discontiguous
  addresses. This contribution is important in that fragmented allocations of IPv4
  addresses are common in the Internet. I apply Hobbit to IPv4 addresses and identify
  0.51M aggregates of addresses (i.e. Hobbit blocks) that contain 1.77M /24 blocks.
  I evaluate the homogeneity of Hobbit blocks using RTTs and show that Hobbit blocks
  are as homogeneous as /24s even though their sizes are generally larger than /24s.
  I then demonstrate that Hobbit blocks improve the efficiency of Internet topology
  mapping by comparing strategies that select destinations from Hobbit and /24 blocks.
  I also quantify the efficiency improvement of latency estimation that can be achieved
  by using Hobbit blocks. I show that Hobbit blocks tend to be stable over time and
  analyze the measurement cost of Hobbit block generation. I finally demonstrate that
  Hobbit blocks can improve the representativeness of network measurement. I develop
  a methodology that measures the representativeness of measurement and show that
  active Internet measurement may not be representative even if the entire IPv4 space
  is probed. By using Hobbit blocks, I adapt weighting adjustment, which is a common
  bias correction technique in surveys, to active Internet measurement. I evaluate
  the weighting adjustment using various kinds of samples and show that the weighting
  adjustment reduces biases in most cases. If Hobbit blocks are given, the weighting
  adjustment incurs no measurement cost. I make Hobbit blocks publicly available and
  update them every month for researchers who want to perform weighting adjustment
  or to improve the efficiency of network measurement.

TITLE: Reducing third parties in the network through client-side intelligence

DOI: 10.7916/D8SB5HN7
TOPKEY: topology-as-rank
GEOLOC: New York, US
ABS: The end-to-end argument describes the communication between a client and server
  using functionality that is located at the end points of a distributed system. From
  a security and privacy perspective, clients only need to trust the server they are
  trying to reach instead of intermediate system nodes and other third-party entities.
  Clients accessing the Internet today and more specifically the World Wide Web have
  to interact with a plethora of network entities for name resolution, traffic routing
  and content delivery. While individual communications with those entities may sometimes
  be end to end, from the users perspective they are intermediaries the user has to
  trust in order to access the website behind a domain name. This complex interaction
  lacks transparency and control and expands the attack surface beyond the server
  clients are trying to reach directly. In this dissertation, we develop a set of
  novel design principles and architectures to reduce the number of third party services
  and networks a clients traffic is exposed to when browsing the web. Our proposals
  bring additional intelligence to the client and can be adopted without changes to
  the third parties. Websites can include content, such as images and iframes, located
  on third-party servers. Browsers loading an HTML page will contact these additional
  servers to satisfy external content dependencies. Such interaction has privacy implications
  because it includes context related to the users browsing history. For example,
  the widespread adoption of social plugins enables the respective social networking
  services to track a growing part of its members online activity. These plugins are
  commonly implemented as HTML iframes originating from the domain of the respective
  social network. They are embedded in sites users might visit, for instance to read
  the news or do shopping. Facebooks Like button is an example of a social plugin.
  While one could prevent the browser from connecting to third-party servers, it would
  break existing functionality and thus be unlikely to be widely adopted. We propose
  a novel design for privacy-preserving social plugins that decouples the retrieval
  of user-specific content from the loading of third-party content. Our approach can
  be adopted by web browsers without the need for server-side changes. Our design
  has the benefit of avoiding the transmission of user-identifying information to
  the third-party server while preserving the original functionality of the plugins.
  In addition, we propose an architecture which reduces the networks involved when
  routing traffic to a website. Users then have to trust fewer organizations with
  their traffic. Such trust is necessary today because for example we observe that
  only 30% of popular web servers offer HTTPS. At the same time there is evidence
  that network adversaries carry out active and passive attacks against users. We
  argue that if end-to-end security with a server is not available the next best thing
  is a secure link to a network that is close to the server and will act as a gateway.
  Our approach identifies network vantage points in the cloud, enables a client to
  establish secure tunnels to them and intelligently routes traffic based on its destination.
  The proliferation of infrastructure-as-a-service platforms makes it practical for
  users to benefit from the cloud. We determine that our architecture is practical
  because our proposed use of the cloud aligns with existing ways end-user devices
  leverage it today. Users control both endpoints of the tunnel and do not depend
  on the cooperation of individual websites. We are thus able to eliminate third-party
  networks for 20% of popular web servers, reduce network paths to 1 hop for an additional
  20% and shorten the rest. We hypothesize that user privacy on the web can be improved
  in terms of transparency and control by reducing the systems and services that are
  indirectly and automatically involved. We also hypothesize that such reduction can
  be achieved unilaterally through client-side initiatives and without affecting the
  operation of individual websites.

ABS: The importance of IXPs to interconnect different networks and exchange traffic
  locally has been well studied over the last few years. However, far less is known
  about the role IXPs play as a platform to enable large-scale content delivery and
  to reach a world-wide customer base. In this paper, we study the infrastructure
  deployment of a content hypergiant, Netflix, and show that the combined worldwide
  IXP substrate is the major cornerstone of its Content Delivery Network. To meet
  its worldwide demand for high-quality video delivery, Netflix has built a dedicated
  CDN. Its scale allows us to study a major part of the Internet ecosystem, by observing
  how Netflix takes advantage of the combined capabilities of IXPs and ISPs present
  in different regions. We find wide disparities in the regional Netflix deployment
  and traffic levels at IXPs and ISPs across various local ecosystems. This highlights
  the complexity of large-scale content delivery as well as differences in the capabilities
  of IXPs in specific regions. On a global scale we find that the footprint provided
  by IXPs allows Netflix to deliver most of its traffic directly from them. This highlights
  the additional role that IXPs play in the Internet ecosystem, not just in terms
  of interconnection, but also allowing players such as Netflix to deliver significant
  amounts of traffic.

ABS: The Internet is the largest artificial network consisting of billions of IP devices,
  managed by tens of thousands of autonomous systems (ASes). Due to its importance,
  the Internet has received much attention and its topological features, mainly in
  AS-level, have been widely explored from the complex network perspective. However,
  most of the previous studies assume a homogeneous model in which nodes are indistinguishable
  in nature. It may be good for a general study of topological structure, but unfortunately
  it fails to reflect the functionality. The Internet ecology is in fact heterogeneous
  and highly complex. It consists of various elements such as Internet Exchange Points
  (IXPs), Internet Content Providers (ICPs), and normal Autonomous System (ASes),
  realizing different roles in the Internet. In this paper, we propose level-structured
  network models for investigating how ICP performs under the AS-topology with power-law
  features and how IXP enhances its performance from a complex network perspective.
  Based on real data, our results reveal that the power-law nature of the Internet
  facilitates content delivery not only in efficiency but also in path redundancy.
  Moreover, the proposed multi-level framework is able to clearly illustrate the significant
  benefits gained by ICP from IXP peerings.

ABS: The mechanism for picking guards in Tor suffers from security problems like guard
  fingerprinting and from performance issues. To address these issues, Hayes and Danezis
  proposed the use of guard sets, in which the Tor system groups all guards into sets,
  and each client picks one of these sets and uses its guards. Unfortunately, guard
  sets frequently need nodes added or they are broken up due to fluctuations in network
  bandwidth. In this paper, we first show that these breakups create opportunities
  for malicious guards to join many guard sets by merely tuning the bandwidth they
  make available to Tor, and this greatly increases the number of clients exposed
  to malicious guards. To address this problem, we propose a new method for forming
  guard sets based on Internet location. We construct a hierarchy that keeps clients
  and guards together more reliably and prevents guards from easily joining arbitrary
  guard sets. This approach also has the advantage of confining an attacker with access
  to limited locations on the Internet to a small number of guard sets. We simulate
  this guard set design using historical Tor data in the presence of both relay-level
  adversaries and network level adversaries, and we find that our approach is good
  at confining the adversary into few guard sets, thus limiting the impact of attacks.

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most long-lasting problems
  in network security. Recently, although the DDoS attack mechanisms are widely understood,
  the problems are becoming more frequent due to the similarity between DDoS attack
  and normal traffic. In this work, we propose two approaches of DDoS attack detection
  which are based on the Self-Organizing Map (SOM). The proposed algorithms with their
  detection architecture are implemented in the Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
  technology which has the flexibility and programmable abilities. The SDN controller
  allows us to quickly perform complex classification and detection algorithm. By
  deploying a testbed environment, we successfully evaluate our proposed algorithms
  in terms of both accuracy and computational overhead. The experimental results show
  that these algorithms can reduce the processing time while maintain the suitable
  accuracy rate.

ABS: Many recent proposals for anonymous communication omit from their security analyses
  a consideration of the effects of time on important system components. In practice,
  many components of anonymity systems, such as the client location and network structure,
  exhibit changes and patterns over time. In this paper, we focus on the effect of
  such temporal dynamics on the security of anonymity networks. We present Tempest,
  a suite of novel attacks based on (1) client mobility, (2) usage patterns, and (3)
  changes in the underlying network routing. Using experimental analysis on real-world
  datasets, we demonstrate that these temporal attacks degrade user privacy across
  a wide range of anonymity networks, including deployed systems such as Tor; path-selection
  protocols for Tor such as DeNASA, TAPS, and Counter-RAPTOR; and network-layer anonymity
  protocols for Internet routing such as Dovetail and HORNET. The degradation is in
  some cases surprisingly severe. For example, a single host failure or network route
  change could quickly and with high certainty identify the clients ISP to a malicious
  host or ISP. The adversary behind each attack is relatively weak - generally passive
  and in control of one network location or a small number of hosts. Our findings
  suggest that designers of anonymity systems should rigorously consider the impact
  of temporal dynamics when analyzing anonymity.

  TE in conventional networks, where hop-by-hop routing is available, and advanced
  technologies such as SDN and MPLS are not deployed. Based on analysis and modelling
  on real Internet traffic, we propose to detect and schedule a few large flows in
  real time, which dominate the traffic amount. The proposed scheme leverages advanced
  algorithms for detection, computes the rerouting paths in a centralized server,
  uses extended OSPF to distribute the routing, and uses a few ACL entries for flow-level
  forwarding. We formalize the link weight assignment-based large flow scheduling
  problem and prove that the problem is NP-hard. We develop algorithms to compute
  the routing and reduce extra LSA number required. We present a set of theoretical
  results on the TE performance bounds when the number of large flows varies. Experiment
  and simulation results show that our scheme can reroute large flows within 0.5 second,
  and the maximum link utilization is within 102% of the optimal solution for source
  and destination addresses-based flows, while the extra LSA number is small.

ABS: We introduce the adaptive cuckoo filter (ACF), a data structure for approximate
  set membership that extends cuckoo filters by reacting to false positives, removing
  them for future queries. As an example application, in packet processing queries
  may correspond to flow identifiers, so a search for an element is likely to be followed
  by repeated searches for that element. Removing false positives can therefore significantly
  lower the false positive rate. The ACF, like the cuckoo filter, uses a cuckoo hash
  table to store fingerprints. We allow fingerprint entries to be changed in response
  to a false positive in a manner designed to minimize the effect on the performance
  of the filter. We show that the ACF is able to significantly reduce the false positive
  rate by presenting both a theoretical model for the false positive rate and simulations
  using both synthetic data sets and real packet traces.

ABS: Data availability should be guaranteed by a web service in order to satisfy customers.
  One of the main challenges of information security professionals is DDoS attack
  which affects the availability. By masquerading itself as a legitimate user, a DDoS
  attacker tries to overwhelm a server by sending numerous amount of useless packets
  that influences the quality of service (QoS) of the network. DDoS attack can result
  in a great damage to network services. Useless packets similar to normal ones are
  dispatched by the attacker which leaves the intrusion detection system impotent
  of detection. Transferring from conventional packet-based analysis methods to time
  series based (flow-based) algorithms would be a promising alternative to spot DDoS
  attacks. In this work, we extract four measures of periodicity, kurtosis, skewness
  and self similarity of a time series and investigate the performance of these parameters
  in separating DDoS attack from normal traffic.

  top 6 most prevalent CSPs are used by 85% of apps, and observe significant differences

  peering relationships with MNOs, and deployment strategies. We also find that CSP
  performance in MNOs is affected by inflated path length, roaming, and presence of
  middleboxes, but not influenced by the choice of DNS resolver.

ABS: 'Internet Background Radiation (IBR) is network pollution, composed of all kinds
  of Internet traffic, namely backscatter data (due to spoofing), botnet scans and
  other traffic pollution (due to misconfigurations in the networking devices). For
  many years, IBR collected at routed, but unused address spaces, known as Network
  Telescope aka Darknet, has been used in multiple network research applications such
  as identifying malicious Internet activities, detecting Internet outages, etc. The
  Internet Outage Detection Analysis (IODA) is a research project of UCSD which uses
  a predictable signal that can be extracted from IBR to monitor the Internet for
  macroscopic Internet connectivity outages. Due to the varied composition of IBR,
  extracting consistent normal IBR traffic is difficult, but at the same time is required
  to detect outages accurately. In this report, I investigate and analyze IBR collected
  at the UC San Diego Network Telescope (UCSD-NT), with the goal of developing a better
  understanding of events distorting the coherent nature of the IBR signal and subsequently
  devising approaches to detect and remove traffic triggered by these events. These
  distortions in the IBR signal can be caused by many events, such as Distributed
  Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, botnet scans, Domain Name Service (DNS) poisoning,
  etc. I investigate these events to study their causes by various means of statistical
  and experimental tools. In my analysis of three years of IBR data, I detect many
  short-term events which distort a stable signal extracted from IBR (used by IODA),
  by generating traffic bursts. Also, I identify and analyze a large-scale event:
  SYNRENT (coined from SYN-BitTorrent), which caused an increase in the TCP-SYN traffic
  reaching the UCSD-NT for over two years. I present a broad characterization of SYNRENT
  in terms of source IPs, countries, Autonomous Systems (AS), operating systems, etc.
  to better understand the phenomenon. This thesis also identifies possible causes
  of SYNRENT such as the Distributed Hash Table (DHT) poisoning of BitTorrent traffic
  in the Great Firewall of China. To mitigate such distorting events and bursts, I
  present a software solution to detect and filter them in real-time: the primary
  idea is to use the history of previously observed unique source IPs on destination
  ports and IPs, to determine the occurrence of a burst. In addition to proposing
  and implementing the solution, I provide substantial evidence to prove that it successfully
  detects and removes the components that distort the signal from IODA preferred IBR. '

ABS: 'Todays Internet fails to provide either source accountability or privacy; packets
  on the Internet cannot be attributed to their source, and communications on the
  Internet cannot be kept private. Furthermore, even if the Internet can be modified
  to support the two properties, simultaneously providing both is difficult because
  they are conflicting. Hence, most future Internet architecture (FIA) proposals have
  focused on one property at the expense of the other. This dissertation explores
  an FIA that balances between source accountability and privacy. To this end, we
  investigate a trust model that can balance the two properties. Then, based on the
  trust model, we design a data plane that balances the properties and satisfies todays
  packet forwarding requirements. Lastly, we explore how to deploy such FIAs. Logically,
  this dissertation is organized into two parts: the first part explores the design
  of an FIA that balances between source accountability and privacy, and the second
  part explores deployment strategies for such an FIA. The first part makes the following
  three contributions. First, we propose the Accountable and Private Network Architecture
  (APNA) that guarantees source accountability while preserving the privacy of the
  users. Second, we strengthen the privacy guarantees of APNA. To this end, we define
  a new concept, flow-packet unlinkability-preventing an adversary from linking packets
  to flows. Then, we extend APNA to achieve flowpacket unlinkability. Lastly, we improve
  the source accountability guarantees by eliminating vulnerabilities introduced by
  replayed packets. Specifically, we first propose an attack that can be launched
  by simply replaying packets using compromised routers. Then, we describe an in-network
  packet replay suppression mechanism to mitigate such attacks. The second part of
  the dissertation explores two different approaches to deploy FIAs-integrated and
  overlay approaches. The overlay approach deploys the FIA itself by constructing
  an overlay over todays Internet. In contrast, the integrated approach deploys the
  FIA by integrating its main ideas into todays Internet; the FIA itself does not
  need to be deployed. This approach uses the FIA research as a means to explore new
  and innovative ideas without confining oneself to the rigidity of todays Internet.
  Then, these new ideas are realized on todays Internet using well-established technologies.
  As an example, we take the key ideas of APNA and realize them on todays Internet

ABS: In this work, we present Nyx, a system for mitigating Distributed Denial of Service
  (DDoS) attacks by routing critical traffic from known benign networks around links
  under attack from a massively distributed botnet. Nyx alters how Autonomous Systems
  (ASes) handle route selection and advertisement in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
  in order to achieve isolation of critical traffic away from congested links onto
  alternative, less congested paths. Our system controls outbound paths through the
  normal process of BGP path selection, while return paths from critical ASes are
  controlled through the use of existing traffic engineering techniques. To prevent
  alternative paths from including attacked network links, Nyx employs strategic lying
  in a manner that is functional in the presence of RPKI. Our system only exposes
  the alternate path to the networks needed for forwarding and those networks customer
  cones, thus strategically reducing the number of ASes outside of the critical AS
  that receive the alternative path. By leaving the path taken by malicious traffic
  unchanged and limiting the amount of added traffic load placed on the alternate
  path, our system causes less than 10 ASes on average to be disturbed by our inbound
  traffic migration.Nyx is the first system that scalably and effectively mitigates
  transit-link DDoS attacks that cannot be handled by existing and costly traffic
  filtering or prioritization techniques. Unlike the prior state of the art, Nyx is
  highly deployable, requiring only minor changes to router policies at the deployer,
  and requires no assistance from external networks. Using our own Internet-scale
  simulator, we find that in more than 98% of cases our system can successfully migrate
  critical traffic off of the network segments under transit-link DDoS. In over 98%
  of cases, the alternate path provides some degree of relief over the original path.
  Finally, in over 70% of cases where Nyx can migrate critical traffic off attacked
  segments, the new path has sufficient capacity to handle the entire traffic load
  without congestion.

ABS: Recent events continue to expose the ability and commitment of Government Intelligence
  Agencies (GIAs) to conduct cross-border surveillance of the Internet. These revelations
  have significant consequences for anonymous communication systems like Tor. Current
  adversarial models do not incorporate international surveillance, meaning that realistic
  adversaries are much more powerful than what is assumed by prior work. In this work,
  we take the first steps towards quantifying the risk of surveillance posed by GIAs.
  We use legal and technical data to assess the hostility of each country to Internet
  traffic, and build a graph of the intelligence treaties between countries to identify
  cross-border surveillance capabilities. Based on this data, we develop metrics that
  quantify the ability of an adversarial GIA to conduct surveillance in any other
  country. We apply our risk metrics to the current state of the Tor anonymity network
  and discover that the majority of Tor users are at significant risk to passive deanonymization
  attacks by GIAs. We incorporate our metrics into alternative Tor relay selection
  algorithms, and show that the resulting circuits have significantly reduced surveillance
  risk, compared to Tors standard relay selection algorithm.

ABS: Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) carry most of the web content, with the
  goals of offering good performance to users at a low cost. In this thesis, we introduce
  measurement and analysis techniques to help CDNs balance these goals. First, we
  allocate resources efficiently across the distributed edge servers by jointly minimizing
  network latency and cache misses. We propose a unified framework for CDNs to jointly
  solve the problems of placement, mapping, and disk allocation, while including the
  impact of cache misses. We evaluate our methods using request logs from a commercial
  CDN. We show that including the impact of cache misses in the post-mapping disk
  allocation enhances the performance significantly for a small increase in the cost.
  Still, there are other sources of performance problems on the end-to-end (e2e) path
  of the servers to clients, which takes us to the next part. Second, to detect and
  diagnose performance problems that cause poor experience for users, we propose a
  fine-grained instrumentation of the e2e path. In particular, we focus on the video
  delivery path because video is now the dominant application of the Internet. We
  deploy our instrumentation and diagnosis methods in a commercial content provider,
  enabling us to join the server-side, TCP statistics, and client-side measurements
  for the first time, and characterize the performance problems in a large set of
  videos. We uncover a wide range of problems, some of which were unknown before,
  and can only be discovered by an e2e instrumentation. While capable of diagnosing
  these problems, our tool is limited in how frequently it measurers network. To remedy
  this, we propose our final solution. Finally, we dive deeper into diagnosing network
  problems by monitoring TCP connections directly in the network devices. Our tool
  can pinpoint if the performance of a TCP connection is hindered by the sender, receiver,
  or network. We deploy emerging programmable edge devices to implement our monitoring
  and diagnosis logic directly in the data plane, which runs at line-rate, without
  cooperation from servers. We infer fine-grained TCP metrics from the edge device
  (e.g, NIC), without imposing storage or monitoring overhead on the servers.

ABS: Distributed software-defined networks (SDN), consisting of multiple inter-connected
  network domains, each managed by one SDN controller, is an emerging networking architecture
  that offers balanced centralized control and distributed operations. Under such
  networking paradigm, most existing works focus on designing sophisticated controller-synchronization
  strategies to improve joint controller-decision-making for inter-domain routing.
  However, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of how the performance
  of distributed SDN is related to network attributes, thus impossible to justify
  the necessity of complicated strategies. In this regard, we analyze and quantify
  the performance enhancement of distributed SDN architectures, influenced by intra-/inter-domain
  synchronization levels and network structural properties. Based on a generic weighted
  network model, we establish analytical methods for performance estimation under
  four synchronization scenarios with increasing synchronization cost. Moreover, two
  of these synchronization scenarios correspond to extreme cases, i.e., minimum/maximum
  synchronization, which are, therefore, capable of bounding the performance of distributed
  SDN with any given synchronization levels. Our theoretical results reveal how network
  performance is related to synchronization levels and inter-domain connections, the
  accuracy of which are confirmed by simulations based on both real and synthetic
  networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work quantifying the performance
  of distributed SDN analytically, which provides fundamental guidance for future
  SDN protocol designs and performance estimation.

ABS: Hadoops popularity as a distributed computing platform continues to grow as more
  and more data is generated each year. As a fault-tolerant and horizontally scalable
  ecosystem, it becomes a suitable platform for the analysis of big network data.
  While most network data are currently being analyzed by vertically scaled machines,
  Hadoop provides an alternative method of analysis, allowing large datasets to be
  analyzed in one horizontally-scaled cluster. This study attempts to benchmark and
  profile the current known methods for performing network analysis on Hadoop. After
  comparing three data storage formats; plain text, Parquet, and raw PCAP files; for
  use in Hadoop, the study has determined that the Parquet and text formats greatly
  outperform the use of raw PCAP files using the hadoop-pcap library which fails to
  complete tests with high volumes of data. This comes at the expense, however, of
  large data loss due to the need to create a well-defined schema for processing and
  the conversion time necessary to shift to a different format. However, Parquet still
  outperforms the text format by an average of approximately 30% in the scan and aggregate
  queries, and 70% and 40% respectively in the join and aggregate-join queries while
  showing a 8%-10% increase of performance in aggregate-join queries of over 60 minutes
  worth of PCAP data.

ABS: Software-defined networking (SDN) is a promising network paradigm for future
  Internet. The centralized controller and simplified switches replace the traditional
  complex forwarding devices, and make network management convenient. However, the
  switches in SDN currently have limited ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)
  to store specific routing rules from the controller. This bottleneck provokes cyber
  attacks to overload the switches. Despite existing some countermeasures for such
  attacks, they are proposed based on simplified attack patterns. In this paper, we
  review the table-overflow attack using a sophisticated attack pattern. In the attack
  pattern, attack flows are targeted at their middle hops instead of endpoints. We
  first define potential targets in the network topology, and then we propose three
  specific traffic features and a monitoring mechanism to detect and locate the attackers.
  Further, we propose a mitigation mechanism to limit the attack rate using the token
  bucket model. With the control of token add rate and bucket capacity, it avoids
  the table overflow on the victim switch. Extensive simulations in different types
  of topologies and experiments in our testbed are provided to show the performance
  of our proposal.

ABS: The evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas in structured populations has
  been studied extensively in recent years. Whereas many theoretical studies have
  found that a heterogeneous network of contacts favors cooperation, the impact of
  spatial effects in scale-free networks is still not well understood. In addition
  to being heterogeneous, real contact networks exhibit a high mean local clustering
  coefficient, which implies the existence of an underlying metric space. Here we
  show that evolutionary dynamics in scale-free networks self-organize into spatial
  patterns in the underlying metric space. The resulting metric clusters of cooperators
  are able to survive in social dilemmas as their spatial organization shields them
  from surrounding defectors, similar to spatial selection in Euclidean space. We
  show that under certain conditions these metric clusters are more efficient than
  the most connected nodes at sustaining cooperation and that heterogeneity does not
  always favor-but can even hinder-cooperation in social dilemmas.

ABS: Tor is the most widely used anonymity network, currently serving millions of
  users each day. However, there is no access control in place for all these users,
  leaving the network vulnerable to botnet abuse and attacks. For example, criminals
  frequently use exit relays as stepping stones for attacks, causing service providers
  to serve CAPTCHAs to exit relay IP addresses or blacklisting them altogether, which
  leads to severe usability issues for legitimate Tor users. To address this problem,
  we propose TorPolice, the first privacy-preserving access control framework for
  Tor. TorPolice enables abuse-plagued service providers such as Yelp to enforce access
  rules to police and throttle malicious requests coming from Tor while still providing
  service to legitimate Tor users. Further, TorPolice equips Tor with global access
  control for relays, enhancing Tors resilience to botnet abuse. We show that TorPolice
  preserves the privacy of Tor users, implement a prototype of TorPolice, and perform
  extensive evaluations to validate our design goals.

ABS: The rapid increase of diverse Internet of things (IoT) services and devices has
  raised numerous challenges in terms of connectivity, computation, and security,
  which networks must face in order to provide satisfactory support. This has led
  to networks evolving into heterogeneous IoT networking infrastructures characterized
  by multiple access technologies and mobile edge computing (MEC) capabilities. The
  heterogeneity of the networks, devices, and services introduces serious vulnerabilities
  to security attacks, especially distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which
  exploit massive IoT devices to exhaust both network and victim resources. As such,
  this study proposes MECshield, a localized DDoS prevention framework leveraging
  MEC power to deploy multiple smart filters at the edge of relevant attack-source/destination
  networks. The cooperation among the smart filters is supervised by a central controller.
  The central controller localizes each smart filter by feeding appropriate training
  parameters into its self-organizing map (SOM) component, based on the attacking
  behavior. The performance of the MECshield framework is verified using three typical
  IoT traffic scenarios. The numerical results reveal that MECshield outperforms existing
  solutions.

ABS: In this paper we present a low cost yet robust DDoS detection method to identify
  all classes of DDoS attacks. Our method attempts to detect DDoS attack by monitoring
  the deviation of the count of unique source IPs and the count of source IPs whose
  transmission rate is higher than a given threshold value. Unlike other similar existing
  methods, our method does not need to maintain a list of source IPs which makes our
  detection method faster. Another advantage of our method is the ability to detect
  attack performed by small size bot net. In case of such an attack the packet rate
  of the attack sources deviate from its mean value significantly and thus we can
  detect this change. We use a non-parametric change point modeling technique to identify
  flooding attacks of all types in real time. An other contribution of this work is
  the development of an attack took referred to as TU-CANNON, to generate different
  variations of DDoS attack under a controlled test-bed environment.

ABS: IP traffic with forged source addresses (i.e., spoofed traffic) enables a series
  of threats ranging from the impersonation of remote hosts to massive denial-of-service
  attacks. Consequently, IP address spoofing received considerable attention with
  efforts to either suppress spoofing, to mitigate its consequences, or to actively
  measure the ability to spoof in individual networks. However, as of today, we still
  lack a comprehensive understanding both of the prevalence and the characteristics
  of spoofed traffic Ain the wildA3/4 as well as of the networks that inject spoofed
  traffic into the Internet. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a method to passively
  detect spoofed packets in traffic exchanged between networks in the inter-domain
  Internet. Our detection mechanism identifies both source IP addresses that should
  never be visible in the inter-domain Internet (i.e., unrouted and bogon sources)
  as well as source addresses that should not be sourced by individual networks, as
  inferred from BGP routing information. We apply our method to classify the traffic
  exchanged between more than 700 networks at a large European IXP. We find that the
  majority of connected networks do not, or not consistently, filter their outgoing
  traffic. Filtering strategies and contributions of spoofed traffic vary heavily
  across networks of different types and sizes. Finally, we study qualitative characteristics
  of spoofed traffic, regarding both application popularity as well as structural
  properties of addresses. Combining our observations, we identify and study dominant
  attack patterns.

ABS: Fast IPv4 scanning has enabled researchers to answer a wealth of new security
  and measurement questions. However, while increased network speeds and computational
  power have enabled comprehensive scans of the IPv4 address space, a brute-force

  of the IPv6 address space and require an algorithmic approach to determine a small
  set of candidate addresses to probe. In this paper, we first explore the considerations
  that guide designing such algorithms. We introduce a new approach that identifies
  dense address space regions from a set of known aseeda addresses and generates a
  set of candidates to scan. We compare our algorithm 6Gen against Entropy/IPathe
  current state of the artafinding that we can recover between 1a8 times as many addresses

ABS: The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) has been used for decades as the de facto protocol
  to exchange reachability information among networks in the Internet. However, little
  is known about how this protocol is used to restrict reachability to selected destinations,
  e.g., that are under attack. While such a feature, BGP blackholing, has been available
  for some time, we lack a systematic study of its Internet-wide adoption, practices,
  and network efficacy, as well as the profile of blackholed destinations. In this
  paper, we develop and evaluate a methodology to automatically detect BGP blackholing
  activity in the wild. We apply our method to both public and private BGP datasets.
  We find that hundreds of networks, including large transit providers, as well as
  about 50 Internet exchange points (IXPs) offer blackholing service to their customers,
  peers, and members. Between 2014-2017, the number of blackholed prefixes increased
  by a factor of 6, peaking at 5K concurrently blackholed prefixes by up to 400 Autonomous
  Systems. We assess the effect of blackholing on the data plane using both targeted
  active measurements as well as passive datasets, finding that blackholing is indeed
  highly effective in dropping traffic before it reaches its destination, though it
  also discards legitimate traffic. We augment our findings with an analysis of the
  target IP addresses of blackholing. Our tools and insights are relevant for operators
  considering offering or using BGP blackholing services as well as for researchers
  studying DDoS mitigation in the Internet.

  of such reports, we still lack an understanding of the impact of cellular networks
  around the world. We present the first comprehensive analysis of global cellular
  networks. We describe an approach to accurately identify cellular network IP addresses
  using the Network Information API, a non-standard Javascript API in several mobile
  browsers, and show its effectiveness in a range cellular network configurations.
  We combine this approach with the vantage point of one of the worldas largest CDNs,
  with servers located in 1,450 networks and clients distributed across across 245
  countries, to characterize cellular access around the globe. We find that the majority
  of cellular networks exist as mixed networks (i.e., networks that share both fixed-line
  and cellular devices), requiring prefix a not ASN a level identification. We discover
  over 350 thousand /24 and 23 thousand /48 cellular IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes respectively.
  By utilizing addresses level traffic from the same CDN, we calculate the fraction
  of traffic coming from cellular addresses. Overall we find that cellular traffic
  comprises 16.2% of the CDNas global traffic, and that cellular traffic ranges widely
  in importance between countries, from capturing nearly 96% of all traffic in Ghana
  to just 12.1% in France.

ABS: The IPv4 Record Route (RR) Option instructs routers to record their IP addresses
  in a packet. RR is subject to a nine hop limit and, traditionally, inconsistent
  support from routers. Recent changes in interdomain connectivityathe so-called aflattening
  Internetaaand new best practices for how routers should handle RR packets suggest
  that now is a good time to reassess the potential of the RR Option. We quantify
  the current utility of RR by issuing RR measurements from PlanetLab and M-Lab to
  every advertised BGP prefix. We find that 75% of addresses that respond to ping
  without RR also respond to ping with RR, and 66% of these RR-responsive addresses
  are within the nine hop limit of at least one vantage point. These numbers suggest
  the RR Option is a useful measurement primitive on todayas Internet.

ABS: This work describes a clean-slate inter-domain routing protocol designed to meet
  the needs of the future mobile Internet. In particular, we describe the edge-aware
  inter-domain routing (EIR) protocol which provides new abstractions, such as aggregated-nodes
  (aNodes) and virtual-links (vLinks) for expressing network topologies and edge network
  properties necessary to address mobility related routing scenarios which are inadequately
  supported by the border gateway protocol (BGP) in use today. Specific usecases addressed
  by EIR include emerging mobility service scenarios such as multi-homing across WiFi
  and cellular, multipath routing over several access networks, and anycast access
  from mobile devices to replicated cloud services. It is shown that EIR can be used
  to realize efficient routing strategies for the mobility use-cases under consideration,
  while also providing support for a range of inter-domain routing policies currently
  associated with BGP. Simulation results for protocol overhead are presented for
  a global-scale CAIDA topology, leading to an identification of parameters necessary
  to obtain a good balance between overhead and routing table convergence time. A
  Click-based proof-of-concept implementation of EIR on the ORBIT testbed is described
  and used to validate performance and functionality for selected mobility use-cases,
  including mobile data services with open WiFi access points and mobile platforms
  such as buses operating in an urban area.

ABS: Network algorithms always prefer low memory cost and fast packet processing speed.
  Forwarding information base (FIB), as a typical network processing component, requires
  a scalable and memory-efficient algorithm to support fast lookups. In this paper,
  we present a new network algorithm, Othello Hashing, and its application of a FIB
  design called Concise, which uses very little memory to support ultra-fast lookups
  of network names. Othello Hashing and Concise make use of minimal perfect hashing
  and relies on the programmable network framework to support dynamic updates. Our
  conceptual contribution of Concise is to optimize the memory efficiency and query
  speed in the data plane and move the relatively complex construction and update
  components to the resource-rich control plane. We implemented Concise on three platforms.
  Experimental results show that Concise uses significantly smaller memory to achieve
  much faster query speed compared to existing solutions of network name lookups.

ABS: 'For years, Internet topology research has been conducted through active measurement.
  For instance, CAIDA builds router level topologies on top of IP level traces obtained
  with traceroute. The resulting graphs contain a significant amount of nodes with
  a very large degree, often exceeding the actual number of interfaces of a router.
  Although this property may result from inaccurate alias resolution, we believe that
  opaque MPLS clouds made of invisible tunnels are the main cause. Using Layer-2 technologies
  such as MPLS, routers can be configured to hide internal IP hops from traceroute.
  Consequently, an entry point of an MPLS network appears as the neighbor of all exit
  points and the whole Layer-3 network turns into a dense mesh of high degree nodes.
  This paper tackles three problems: the revelation of IP hops hidden by MPLS tunnels,
  the MPLS deployment underestimation, and the overestimation of high degree nodes.
  We develop new measurement techniques able to reveal the presence and content of
  invisible MPLS tunnels. We assess them through emulation and cross-validation and
  perform a large-scale measurement campaign targeting suspicious networks on which
  we apply statistical analysis. Finally, based on our dataset, we look at basic graph

  (NRENs) runs an exclusive data network for education and research in east and southern
  Africa. Despite a high degree of route redundancy in the Alliances topology, a large
  portion of Internet traffic between the NRENs is circuitously routed through Europe.
  This thesis proposes a performance-based strategy for dynamic ranking of inter-NREN
  paths to reduce latencies. The thesis makes two contributions: firstly, mapping
  Africas inter-NREN topology and quantifying the extent and impact of circuitous
  routing; and, secondly, a dynamic traffic engineering scheme based on Software Defined
  Networking (SDN), Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) and Reinforcement
  Learning. To quantify the extent and impact of circuitous routing among Africas
  NRENs, active topology discovery was conducted. Traceroute results showed that up
  to 75% of traffic from African sources to African NRENs went through inter-continental
  routes and experienced much higher latencies than that of traffic routed within
  Africa. An efficient mechanism for topology discovery was implemented by incorporating
  prior knowledge of overlapping paths to minimize redundancy during measurements.
  Evaluation of the network probing mechanism showed a 47% reduction in packets required
  to complete measurements. An interactive geospatial topology visualization tool
  was designed to evaluate how NREN stakeholders could identify routes between NRENs.
  Usability evaluation showed that users were able to identify routes with an accuracy
  level of 68%. NRENs are faced with at least three problems to optimize traffic engineering,
  namely: how to discover alternate end-to-end paths; how to measure and monitor performance
  of different paths; and how to reconfigure alternate end-to-end paths. This work
  designed and evaluated a traffic engineering mechanism for dynamic discovery and
  configuration of alternate inter-NREN paths using SDN, LISP and Reinforcement Learning.
  A LISP/SDN based traffic engineering mechanism was designed to enable NRENs to dynamically
  rank alternate gateways. Emulation-based evaluation of the mechanism showed that
  dynamic path ranking was able to achieve 20% lower latencies compared to the default
  static path selection. SDN and Reinforcement Learning were used to enable dynamic
  packet forwarding in a multipath environment, through hop-by-hop ranking of alternate
  links based on latency and available bandwidth. The solution achieved minimum latencies
  with significant increases in aggregate throughput compared to static single path
  packet forwarding. Overall, this thesis provides evidence that integration of LISP,
  SDN and Reinforcement Learning, as well as ranking and dynamic configuration of
  paths could help Africas NRENs to minimise latencies and to achieve better throughputs.'

  In this manuscript, we practice dual rating association procedures, namely, Quick

  categorize genuine traffic from attack traffic. We catch that FRA achieves better

ABS: Networking operational costs and environmental concerns have lately driven the

  (EEE) interfaces can greatly reduce power demands when compared with regular Ethernet
  interfaces. Their power saving capabilities have been studied and modeled in many
  research articles in the last few years, together with their effects on traffic
  delay. However, to this date, all articles have considered them in isolation instead
  of as part of a network of EEE interfaces. In this letter, we develop a model for
  the traffic delay on a network of EEE interfaces. We prove that, whatever the network
  topology, the per interface delay increment due to the power savings capabilities
  is bounded and, in most scenarios, negligible. This confirms that EEE interfaces
  can be used in all but the most delay constrained scenarios to save considerable
  amounts of power.

  actuality; the capabilities of the hackers are additionally growing. From early
  news of focusing on the network and transport layer, now a dayas application layer
  becomes the point of convergence of the attacks. In the paper, we first analyze
  the features from incoming packets. These features include Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
  (HTTP) count, the number of the Internet Protocol (IP) address during a time window,
  the constant mapping of the port number and frame of the packets. In the paper,
  we write all the combinations of these metrics and then analyzed the clientas behaviors
  from the public attack and normal data sets. We use Environmental Protection Agency-Hypertext
  Transfer Protocol (EPA-HTTP) DDoS, Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA)
  2007 and experimentally produced DDoS data set using Slowloris attack to draw the
  efficiency and effectiveness of the features for layer seven DDoS detection. Second,
  we employ Multilayer Perceptron with a Genetic Algorithm (MLP-GA) to estimate the
  efficiency of the detection using the metrics. The experimental results show that
  MLP-GA provides the best efficiency of 98.04% for detecting the layer seven DDoS
  attacks. The proposed method provides a minimum value of False Positive when compared

ABS: In a connected world Internet security is becoming increasingly important. Attacks,
  which are frequently executed by botnets, can impact people in their everyday life.
  A ubiquitous kind of attack is the amplification attack, a special type of Denial-of-Service
  attack. Several protocols such as DNS, NTP, and SNMP are known to be vulnerable
  to amplification attacks when security practices are not followed. In this work
  we evaluate the vulnerability of BACnet, a building automation and control protocol,
  to amplification attacks. To assess BACnetas vulnerability we conduct active traffic
  measurements on an Internet-wide scale. We find 16 485 BACnet devices, the largest
  number to date. Additionally, more than 14 k of these devices can be misused as
  amplifiers, with some generating amplification factors up to 120. To remediate this
  potential threat we employ a vulnerability notification campaign in close coordination
  with a CERT. We assess the success of the campaign and find that the number of publicly
  reachable BACnet devices decreased only slightly. Additionally, we employ passive
  measurements to attribute the majority of BACnet traffic in the wild to scanning
  projects. Finally, we also give suggestions to thwart the amplification attack potential
  of BACnet.

GEOLOC: Amherst, MA, US
ABS: Decoy routing is an emerging approach for censorship circumvention in which circumvention
  is implemented with help from a number of volunteer Internet autonomous systems,
  called decoy ASes. Recent studies on decoy routing consider all decoy routing systems
  to be susceptible to a fundamental attack -- regardless of their specific designs--in
  which the censors re-route traffic around decoy ASes, thereby preventing censored
  users from using such systems. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for
  decoy routing that, by design, is significantly stronger to rerouting attacks compared
  to all previous designs. Unlike previous designs, our new architecture operates
  decoy routers only on the downstream traffic of the censored users; therefore we
  call it downstream-only decoy routing. As we demonstrate through Internet-scale
  BGP simulations, downstream-only decoy routing offers significantly stronger resistance
  to rerouting attacks, which is intuitively because a (censoring) ISP has much less
  control on the downstream BGP routes of its traffic. Designing a downstream-only
  decoy routing system is a challenging engineering problem since decoy routers do
  not intercept the upstream traffic of censored users. We design the first downstream-only
  decoy routing system, called Waterfall, by devising unique covert communication
  mechanisms. We also use various techniques to make our Waterfall implementation
  resistant to traffic analysis attacks. We believe that downstream-only decoy routing
  is a significant step towards making decoy routing systems practical. This is because
  a downstream-only decoy routing system can be deployed using a significantly smaller
  number of volunteer ASes, given a target resistance to rerouting attacks. For instance,
  we show that a Waterfall implementation with only a single decoy AS is as resistant
  to routing attacks (against China) as a traditional decoy system (e.g., Telex) with
  53 decoy ASes.

  Such overlays can employ traffic relays to yield path latencies lower than the direct

  the opportunities of reducing latency using TIVs. However, they do not investigate
  the gains of strategically selecting relays in Colocation Facilities (Colos). In
  this work, we answer the following questions: (i) how Colo-hosted relays compare
  with other relays as well as with the direct Internet, in terms of latency (RTT)
  reductions; (ii) what are the best locations for placing the relays to yield these
  reductions. To this end, we conduct a large-scale one-month measurement of inter-domain

  employ as relays Planetlab nodes, other RA nodes, and machines in Colos. We examine
  the RTTs of the overlay paths obtained via the selected relays, as well as the direct
  paths. We find that Colo-based relays perform the best and can achieve latency reductions
  against direct paths, ranging from a few to 100s of milliseconds, in 76% of the

GEOLOC: Ann Arbor, MI, US
ABS: Recent theoretical work on the modeling of network structure has focused primarily
  on networks that are static and unchanging, but many real-world networks change
  their structure over time. There exist natural generalizations to the dynamic case
  of many static network models, including the classic random graph, the configuration
  model, and the stochastic block model, where one assumes that the appearance and
  disappearance of edges are governed by continuous-time Markov processes with rate
  parameters that can depend on properties of the nodes. Here we give an introduction
  to this class of models, showing for instance how one can compute their equilibrium
  properties. We also demonstrate their use in data analysis and statistical inference,
  giving efficient algorithms for fitting them to observed network data using the
  method of maximum likelihood. This allows us, for example, to estimate the time
  constants of network evolution or infer community structure from temporal network
  data using cues embedded both in the probabilities over time that node pairs are
  connected by edges and in the characteristic dynamics of edge appearance and disappearance.
  We illustrate these methods with a selection of applications, both to computer-generated
  test networks and real-world examples.

ABS: Packet transformers are widely used in ISPs, datacenter infrastructures, and
  layer-2 networks. Existing network verification tools do not scale to large networks
  with transformers (e.g., MPLS, IP-in-IP, and NAT). Toward scalable verification,
  we conceived a novel packet equivalence relation. For networks with packet transformers,
  we first present a formal definition of the packet equivalence relation. Our transformer
  model is general, including most transformers used in real networks. We also present
  a new definition of atomic predicates that specify the coarsest equivalence classes
  of packets in the packet space. We designed an algorithm for computing these atomic
  predicates. We built a verifier, named Atomic Predicates for Transformers, and evaluated
  its performance using four network data sets with MPLS tunnels, IP-in-IP tunnels,
  and NATs. For a provider cone data set with 11.6 million forwarding rules, 92 routers,
  1920 duplex ports, and 40 MPLS tunnels which use 170 transformers, APT used only
  0.065 s, on average, to compute the reachability tree from a source port to all
  other ports for all packets and perform loop detection as well. For the Stanford
  and Internet2 data sets with NATs, APT is faster than HSA (Hassel in C implementation)
  by two to three orders of magnitude. By working with atomic predicates instead of
  individual packets, APT achieves verification performance gains by orders of magnitude.

ABS: Obtaining flow-level measurements, similar to those provided by Netflow/IPFIX,
  with OpenFlow is challenging as it requires the installation of an entry per flow
  in the flow tables. This approach does not scale well with the number of concurrent
  flows in the traffic as the number of entries in the flow tables is limited and
  small. Flow monitoring rules may also interfere with forwarding or other rules already
  present in the switches, which are often defined at different granularities than
  the flow level. In this project, we present a transparent and scalable flow-based
  monitoring solution that is fully compatible with current off-the-shelf OpenFlow
  switches. As in NetFlow/IPFIX, we aggregate packets into flows directly in the switches
  and asynchronously send traffic reports to an external collector. For the sake of
  scalability, we propose two different traffic sampling methods depending on the
  OpenFlow features available in the switch. We developed our complete flow monitoring
  solution within OpenDaylight controller and evaluated its accuracy in a testbed
  with Open vSwitch. Our experimental results using real-world traffic traces show
  that the proposed sampling methods are accurate and can effectively reduce the resource
  requirements of flow monitoring in OpenFlow environments.

ABS: Hierarchical addressing and locator/ID separation solutions have been proposed
  to address the scalability issue of the Internet. However, how to combine the two
  addressing schemes has not been received much attention. In this paper, we present
  an address encoding method to integrate hierarchical addressing and locator/ID separation.
  Our analysis and evaluation results show that the proposed encoding method could
  guarantee the scalability property, and alleviate the inefficiency of address space.

ABS: The current Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) operation in the Internet has a serious
  problem with regard to Mis-Origination, which is the hijacking or misconfiguration
  of network prefixes. We already have several Origin Validation (OV) techniques to
  mitigate the impact of Mis-Origination. An Internet Routing Registry (IRR) has been
  deployed only for a small number of users. More recently, RPKI (Resource Public
  Key Infrastructure) has come to be considered as the reality of the OV However,
  quantitative and large-scale simulation studies of its effect are not discussed
  deeply. In this paper, a quantitative simulation method of the OV effect for BGP
  is proposed. OVas impact on the entire Internet is measured in detail. Our results
  indicate that 1.56% of the top-ranked ASes can protect 98.70% of the ASes from Mis-Origination

ABS: Interactive and multimedia applications depend on the stability of end-to-end
  paths on the Internet for predictable performance and good quality of service. On
  the other hand, network providers depend on multiple paths to ensure fault tolerance
  and use load balancing between these paths to enhance the overall network throughput.
  In this study, we analyze the path dynamics within service providers networks using
  a month of measurement data from the RIPE Atlas platform which collects path traces
  between a source and a destination pair approximately every 15 minutes. Determining
  path segments belonging to each Autonomous System (AS), we explore ingress to egress
  paths of an AS in addition to source to destination paths within the AS. We observe
  that 13.2% of ASes contain routing loops within their network indicating mis-configuration
  of routers. Couple of ASes had over a million loops with over 100 routers causing
  loops in path traces. Additionally, 77.6% of end-to-end routes have at least two
  alternative AS paths with some end-to-end routes going through hundreds of different
  AS paths. Analyzing trace segments between ingresses and egresses of an AS, we realized
  more than a third of the backbone ASes have consistent routing between any node
  pair, but others implement load balancing or have inconsistent routing policies
  across their network.

ABS: Obtaining flow-level measurements, similar to those provided by Netflow/IPFIX,
  with OpenFlow is challenging as it requires the installation of an entry per flow
  in the flow tables. This approach does not scale well with the number of concurrent
  flows in the traffic as the number of entries in the flow tables is limited and
  small. Flow monitoring rules may also interfere with forwarding or other rules already
  present in the switches, which are often defined at different granularities than
  the flow level. In this paper, we present a transparent and scalable flow-based
  monitoring solution that is fully compatible with current off-the-shelf OpenFlow
  switches. As in NetFlow/IPFIX, we aggregate packets into flows directly in the switches
  and asynchronously send traffic reports to an external collector. In order to reduce
  the overhead, we implement two different traffic sampling methods depending on the
  OpenFlow features available in the switch. We developed our complete flow monitoring
  solution within OpenDaylight and evaluated its accuracy in a testbed with Open vSwitch.
  Our experimental results using real-world traffic traces show that the proposed
  sampling methods are accurate and can effectively reduce the resource requirements
  of flow measurements in OpenFlow.

ABS: A real-time DDoS attack detection method should identify attacks with low computational

  DDoS attack detection, real-time statistical solution to detect DDoS attacks in
  hardware is only a few. In this paper, a real-time DDoS detection method is proposed
  that uses a novel correlation measure to identify DDoS attacks. Effectiveness of
  the method is evaluated with three network datasets, viz., CAIDA DDoS 2007, MIT
  DARPA, and TUIDS. Further, the proposed method is implemented on an FPGA to analyze
  its performance. The method yields high detection accuracy and the FPGA implementation
  requires less than one microsecond to identify an attack.

ABS: Millions of people across the globe access Internet-based applications and web
  services in their day to day activities. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack
  is one of the prominent attacks that cripple down the computing and communication
  resources of a web server hosting these services and applications. The situation
  turns further crucial when DDoS attacks are launch during similar looking legitimate
  traffic called a flash event (FE). Both DDoS attacks and FEs causes a sudden surge
  in the network traffic leading to delay in the responses from the web server. It
  often leads to massive financial losses, and thus, require timely actions. This
  paper presents a comprehensive review that broadly discusses the DDoS and FE problem,
  and recapitulates the recently published strategies in this field. As part of the
  work, a pragmatic list of rationales to discriminate the two has been proposed.
  This list can help the researcher community for better understanding the problem
  and can provide more effective solutions to the ongoing problem of discriminating
  DDoS attacks from FEs.

  services. Network security tools provide methods to network attackers as well as
  network defenders to identify vulnerabilities and open network services. This chapter
  is composed of three major parts, discussing practical tools for both network attackers
  and defenders. In the first part, we discuss tools an attacker may use to launch
  an attack in real-time environment. In the second part, tools for network defenders
  to protect enterprise networks are covered. Such tools are used by network defenders
  to minimize occurrences of precursors of attacks. In the last part, we discuss an
  approach to develop a real-time network traffic monitoring and analysis tool. We
  include code for launching of attack, sniffing of traffic, and visualization them
  to distinguish attacks. The developed tool can detect attacks and mitigate the same
  in real time within a short time interval. Network attackers intentionally try to
  identify loopholes and open services and also gain related information for launching
  a successful attack.

ABS: Volumetric attacks, which overwhelm the bandwidth of a destination, are amongst
  the most common DDoS attacks today. One practical approach to addressing these attacks
  is to redirect all destination traffic (e.g., via DNS or BGP) to a third-party,
  DDoS-protection-as-a-service provider (e.g., CloudFlare) that is well provisioned
  and equipped with filtering mechanisms to remove attack traffic before passing the
  remaining benign traffic to the destination. An alternative approach is based on
  the concept of network capabilities, whereby source sending rates are determined
  by receiver consent, in the form of capabilities enforced by the network. While
  both third-party scrubbing services and network capabilities can be effective at
  reducing unwanted traffic at an overwhelmed destination, DDoS-protection-as-a-service
  solutions outsource all of the scheduling decisions (e.g., fairness, priority and
  attack identification) to the provider, while capability-based solutions require
  extensive modifications to existing infrastructure to operate. In this paper we
  introduce MiddlePolice, which seeks to marry the deployability of DDoS-protection-as-a-service
  solutions with the destination-based control of network capability systems. We show
  that by allowing feedback from the destination to the provider, MiddlePolice can
  effectively enforce destination-chosen traffic control policies, while requiring
  no deployment from unrelated parties

ABS: Distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is one of the top-rated cyber threats
  currently. It runs down the victim server resources such as bandwidth and buffer
  size by obstructing the server to provide resources to legitimate clients. In this
  article, we propose a mathematical model of DDoS attack; we discuss its relation
  to the features such as inter-arrival time or rate of arrival of the attacking clients
  accessing the server. We further analyse the attack model in context to exhausting
  bandwidth and buffer size of the victim server. The proposed method uses an unsupervised
  learning method, self-organising map, to form the clusters of identical features.
  Lastly, the article applies mathematical correlation and the normal probability
  distribution on the clusters and analyses their behaviours to detect a DDoS attack.
  The article uses the CAIDA 2007 data set for analysing and confirmation of the proposed
  model.

ABS: Recent years have seen an uprise in the development of middleboxes functionalities
  (CGNATs, proxies, accelerators, etc), participating so in the ossification of the
  Internet. In parallel, various solutions have been developed to detect or circumvent
  unwanted middleboxes interferences such as UDP-based middlebox-proof transports
  (Googleas QUIC, PLUS), middleboxproof extensions to TCP (HICCUPS, TCPcrypt), and
  middlebox traversal mechanisms (STUN, ICE, PLUS) [1]. All those solutions make the
  assumption of ubiquitous middleboxes. However, a view of their actual deployment
  in the wild, in IPv4 wired networks, is missing. In particular, knowing how autonomous
  systems (ASes) deploy middleboxes in terms of prevalence and persistence would provide
  additional relevant information to Internet topology models. In this paper, we aim
  at filling this gap. Based on a large-scale measurement campaign, we highlight different
  characteristics of middlebox deployment within ASes to elicit middleboxes profiles.

ABS: The diversity of Fog Computing deployment models and the lack of publicly available

  framework tailored for Fog Computing scenarios---that enables the from-scratch design
  of Fog Computing infrastructures and the emulation of real applications and workloads.
  EmuFog enables researchers to design the network topology according to the use-case,
  embed Fog Computing nodes in the topology and run Docker-based applications on those
  nodes connected by an emulated network. Each of the sub-modules of EmuFog are easily
  extensible, although EmuFog provides a default implementation for each of them.
  The scalability and efficacy of EmuFog are evaluated both on synthetic and real-world

ABS: 'Approximate computing aims for efficient execution of workflows where an approximate
  output is sufficient instead of the exact output. The idea behind approximate computing
  is to compute over a representative sample instead of the entire input dataset.
  Thus, approximate computing - based on the chosen sample size - can make a systematic
  trade-off between the output accuracy and computation efficiency. Unfortunately,
  the state-of-the-art systems for approximate computing primarily target batch analytics,
  where the input data remains unchanged during the course of sampling. Thus, they
  are not well-suited for stream analytics. This motivated the design of StreamApprox
  - a stream analytics system for approximate computing. To realize this idea, we
  designed an online stratified reservoir sampling algorithm to produce approximate
  output with rigorous error bounds. Importantly, our proposed algorithm is generic
  and can be applied to two prominent types of stream processing systems: (1) batched
  stream processing such as Apache Spark Streaming, and (2) pipelined stream processing
  such as Apache Flink. We evaluated StreamApprox using a set of microbenchmarks and
  real-world case studies. Our results show that Spark- and Flink-based StreamApprox
  systems achieve a speedup of 1.15x - 3x compared to the respective native Spark
  Streaming and Flink executions, with varying sampling fraction of 80% to 10%. Furthermore,
  we have also implemented an improved baseline in addition to the native execution
  baseline - a Spark-based approximate computing system leveraging the existing sampling
  modules in Apache Spark. Compared to the improved baseline, our results show that
  StreamApprox achieves a speedup 1.1x - 2.4x while maintaining the same accuracy

ABS: A broad variety of problems, such as targeted marketing and the spread of viruses
  and malware, have been modeled as maximizing the reach of diffusion through a network.
  In cyber-security applications, however, a key consideration largely ignored in
  this literature is stealth. In particular, an attacker who has a specific target
  in mind succeeds only if the target is reached before the malicious payload is detected
  and corresponding countermeasures deployed. The dual side of this problem is deployment
  of a limited number of monitoring units, such as cyber-forensics specialists, to
  limit the success of such targeted and stealthy diffusion processes. We investigate
  the problem of optimal monitoring of targeted stealthy diffusion processes. While
  natural variants of this problem are NP-hard, we show that if stealthy diffusion
  starts from randomly selected nodes, the defenders objective is submodular and can
  be approximately optimized. In addition, we present approximation algorithms for
  the setting where the choice of the starting point is adversarial. We further extend
  our results to settings where the diffusion starts at multiple-seed nodes simultaneously,
  and where there is an inherent delay in detecting the infection. Our experimental
  results show that the proposed algorithms are highly effective and scalable.

ABS: 'Todays society is dependent on computer networks, so managing those networks
  is a crucial task. In order to manage computer networks it is necessary to know
  how information travels through them. One way to gain this knowledge is by generating
  traffic arrays, which indicate the amount of information exchanged between each
  pair of devices on the network. To generate these arrays requires the installation
  of observers to measure traffic in the links, however this operation is very costly.
  In recent years, data-chain processing algorithms based on probabilistic data structures
  have allowed traffic monitoring at a low computational cost. Manipulating probabilistic
  data structures in observers can be done quickly and with little memory space. However,
  even with probabilistic data structures, it is still necessary to install observers
  on all devices on the monitored network to generate traffic arrays, which incurs
  high deployment costs. In this context, this dissertation proposes and defines the
  problem of Minimizing the Set of Observers for Traffic Matrix Generation (MCO-MT)
  which consists in minimizing the number of observers installed in the network, that
  is, minimizing the size of the necessary observer set to generate traffic matrices
  using probabilistic data structures. The problem is modeled and solved as a Set
  Coverage problem. In addition to the definition of MCO-MT, This work proposes: i)
  the development of a tool, called BitMatrix, for simulation and validation of traffic
  matrix generation using data chain processing algorithms based on probabilistic

  proposed combination mechanism focuses on exploiting the advantages of two classification
  algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree(DT). SVM takes less time
  to classify network flows with high accuracy and DT predicts flow more reliably
  with pre-learned data mining techniques. We propose a mechanism to combine SVM and
  DT to handle distributed denial of service attacks and protect network components
  from resource depletion in Software-Defined Networking. SVM first classifies the
  entire flow in flow-tables from OpenFlow switches. It is difficult to determine
  whether the classified flow is an attack flow in the graph representing the SVM
  or an attack flow or an normal flow if it is located between the edge of the line
  or a blurred or obscure part that is difficult to define clearly whether it is an
  attack on the baseline of the flow The final decision is forwarded to DT to detect
  the attack flow more clearly. After that, the Attack Classifier and Policy Enforcement
  modules are applied to the flow for attack mitigation and SDN controller protection.
  In addition, we introduce a new viewpoint of distributed denial of service attack
  in Software-Defined Networking.In this work, experiments that can be realized in
  Software-Defined Networking have proven that the proposed classification combination
  mechanism has better performance than the existing mechanism. The new SVM-DT combination
  mechanism is effective and innovative way that protects the SDN controller and OpenFlow

ABS: This paper presents a new abstraction called Named-Objects for enabling flexible
  and advanced mobility services in the future Internet. The concept of named-objects
  falls under the broad category of information centric networks (ICN) and is based
  on the assignment of a globally unique identifier to all Internet attached objects
  while separating this name from the routable address or locator. This approach is
  supported by a global name resolution service (GNRS) which dynamically maps names
  to addresses while also providing supplementary service information where desired.
  The named-object abstraction is outlined and exemplary mobility related services
  including device mobility, multihoming and multicast are discussed. A qualitative
  and quantitative evaluation of the named-object architecture is given relative to
  alternative ICN designs such as Content Centric Networking (CCN) as well as name-based
  protocols evolved from IP, i.e. HIP and LISP, showing superior performance for a
  wide range of mobility services and the potential to serve as a foundation for future
  mobile network protocols.

ABS: 'Discriminating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) from Flash Crowds (FC) is
  a tough and challenging problem, because there are many similarities between each
  other existed in network layer. In this paper, according to an extensive analysis
  of user traffic behavior of DDoS and FC, it can be found that some traffic abnormalities
  are existed between Bots and legitimate users. So a behavior-based method employed
  Data Mining is proposed to distinguish each other, and two public real-world datasets
  are used to evaluate the method. Whats more, simulated traffic are produced to evaluate
  the method further, which is based on statistical parameters took from the two datasets
  and combined with two popular and common distributions together, Gaussian Distribution
  and Pareto Distribution. And two types of simulations are considered: Novice Simulation
  and Veteran Simulation. The result in Novice Simulation has almost 100% accuracy,
  while in Veteran Simulation, the result has a more than 98% accuracy, less than
  15% FRP and 3% FNR, all of them show the proposed method could have a good accuracy
  and robustness. In addition, compared it with traditional methods-Entropy and Threshold
  methods in Veteran Simulation, the results indicate that both of them could hardly
  distinguish DDoS and FC, while the proposed method could achieve a better distinguished
  effect.'

ABS: The Mirai botnet, composed primarily of embedded and IoT devices, took the Internet
  by storm in late 2016 when it overwhelmed several high-profile targets with massive
  distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we provide a seven-month
  retrospective analysis of Miraias growth to a peak of 600k infections and a history
  of its DDoS victims. By combining a variety of measurement perspectives, we analyze
  how the botnet emerged, what classes of devices were affected, and how Mirai variants
  evolved and competed for vulnerable hosts. Our measurements serve as a lens into
  the fragile ecosystem of IoT devices. We argue that Mirai may represent a sea change
  in the evolutionary development of botnetsathe simplicity through which devices
  were infected and its precipitous growth, demonstrate that novice malicious techniques
  can compromise enough low-end devices to threaten even some of the best-defended
  targets. To address this risk, we recommend technical and nontechnical interventions,
  as well as propose future research directions.

ABS: In recent years, there are increasing interests in using path identifiers (PIDs)
  as inter-domain routing objects. However, the PIDs used in existing approaches are
  static, which makes it easy for attackers to launch the distributed denial-of-service
  (DDoS) flooding attacks. To address this issue, in this paper, we present the design,
  implementation, and evaluation of dynamic PID (D-PID), a framework that uses PIDs
  negotiated between the neighboring domains as inter-domain routing objects. In D-PID,
  the PID of an inter-domain path connecting the two domains is kept secret and changes
  dynamically. We describe in detail how neighboring domains negotiate PIDs and how
  to maintain ongoing communications when PIDs change. We build a 42-node prototype
  comprised of six domains to verify D-PIDs feasibility and conduct extensive simulations
  to evaluate its effectiveness and cost. The results from both simulations and experiments
  show that D-PID can effectively prevent DDoS attacks.

ABS: Network measurement remains a missing piece in todays software packet processing
  platforms. Sketches provide a promising building block for filling this void by
  monitoring every packet with fixed-size memory and bounded errors. However, our
  analysis shows that existing sketch-based measurement solutions suffer from severe
  performance drops under high traffic load. Although sketches are efficiently designed,
  applying them in network measurement inevitably incurs heavy computational overhead.
  We present SketchVisor, a robust network measurement framework for software packet
  processing. It augments sketch-based measurement in the data plane with a fast path,
  which is activated under high traffic load to provide high-performance local measurement
  with slight accuracy degradations. It further recovers accurate network-wide measurement
  results via compressive sensing. We have built a SketchVisor prototype on top of
  Open vSwitch. Extensive testbed experiments show that SketchVisor achieves high
  throughput and high accuracy for a wide range of network measurement tasks and microbenchmarks.

ABS: Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a new programmable networking model that
  features the detachment of control and data planes. In this network, the network
  brain is an SDN controller that is used to centrally monitor and control the data
  plane based on the OpenFlow protocol and applications located in the application
  layer. In recent years, a vast number of issues relating to security have been seriously
  debated for this networking paradigm, especially the large-scale model. In particular,
  flooding attacks have been on the rise, providing great challenges for the SDN architecture
  to cope with. In this paper, we present a novel mechanism using the Self-Organizing
  Map (SOM) application to solve the performance bottleneck and overload problems
  for the upper layers in a large-sized SDN in case of flooding attacks. Our proposed
  approach integrates a Distributed Self-Organizing Map (DSOM) system to OpenFlow
  Switches instead of using a standalone SOM. By exploiting SDN advantages, such as
  flexibility and overhead reduction, we implement and test both a DSOM system and
  a single SOM system on multi-criteria to compare the performance of our introduced
  system. Our experimental results show that the DSOM solution can effectively detect
  abnormal traffic, solve bottleneck problems and increase the system reaction speed
  to attack traffic, while presenting a smaller overhead to the network system.

ABS: The aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the stochastic

  Traffic are based on samples captured several years ago, where both Internets applications
  and user behavior were quite different from todays world. In this paper, a stochastic
  traffic analysis of contemporary Internet traffic seen on high-speed backbone links,
  where the size of the analyzed samples amounts to the billions of packets, is presented.
  The probability distribution functions of packet inter-arrival time, number of packets
  per unit of time, and average packet length were both calculated and analyzed. A
  wide sense stationarity test for the observed traffic was performed on several time
  scales. In order to analyze the self-similarity properties of the process, the Hurst
  index, obtained through the wavelet transform method, was employed. Finally, decimation
  used a useful auxiliary technique in the process of scale invariance analysis is
  presented.

ABS: Monitoring tasks, such as anomaly and DDoS detection, require identifying frequent
  flow aggregates based on common IP prefixes. These are known as hierarchical heavy
  hitters (HHH), where the hierarchy is determined based on the type of prefixes of
  interest in a given application. The per packet complexity of existing HHH algorithms
  is proportional to the size of the hierarchy, imposing significant overheads. In
  this paper, we propose a randomized constant time algorithm for HHH. We prove probabilistic
  precision bounds backed by an empirical evaluation. Using four real Internet packet
  traces, we demonstrate that our algorithm indeed obtains comparable accuracy and
  recall as previous works, while running up to 62 times faster. Finally, we extended
  Open vSwitch (OVS) with our algorithm and showed it is able to handle 13.8 million
  packets per second. In contrast, incorporating previous works in OVS only obtained
  2.5 times lower throughput.

ABS: A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an austere menace to network
  security. Nowadays in a technological era, DDoS attacks pose a severe threat to
  widely used Internet-based services and applications. Disruption of these services
  even for a fraction of time lead to huge financial losses. A Flash event (FE) is
  similar to a DDoS attack wherein a large number of legitimate users starts accessing
  a particular service concurrently leading to the denial of service. Both of these
  events cause overloading of network resources such as bandwidth, CPU, Memory to
  legitimate users and result in limited accessibility. Nowadays most of the DDoS
  attacks use the logical semantics of HTTP protocol to launch a similar kind of attack
  traffic as that of legitimate traffic which makes the distinction between the two
  very challenging. Many researchers have tried to discriminate these two types of
  traffic, but none of them has been able to provide any effective solution yet. This
  paper systematically reviews 40 such prominent research papers from 2002 to till
  date for providing insight into the problem of discriminating DDoS and FEs. This
  article dowries and deliberates the list of traffic feature rationales and detection
  metrics used by the fellow researchers at both macro and micro level. Such a pragmatic
  list of rationales would surely be helpful to provide more robust and efficient
  solutions. The paper also highlights open issues, research challenges and future
  directions in this area.

ABS: 'Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are networks that distribute content in the
  Internet. CDNs are increasingly responsible for the largest share of traffic in
  the Internet. CDNs distribute popular content to caches in many geographical areas
  to save bandwidth by avoiding unnecessary multihop retransmission. By bringing the
  content geographically closer to the user, CDNs also reduce the latency of the services.
  Besides end users and content providers, which require high availability of high
  quality content, CDN providers and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are interested
  in an efficient operation of CDNs. In order to ensure an efficient replication of
  the content, CDN providers have a network of (globally) distributed interconnected
  datacenters at different points of presence (PoPs). ISPs aim to provide reliable
  and high speed Internet access. They try to keep the load on the network low and
  to reduce cost for connectivity with other ISPs. The increasing number of mobile
  devices such as smart phones and tablets, high definition video content and high
  resolution displays result in a continuous growth in mobile traffic. This growth
  in mobile traffic is further accelerated by newly emerging services, such as mobile
  live streaming and broadcasting services. The steep increase in mobile traffic is
  expected to reach by 2018 roughly 60% of total network traffic, the majority of
  which will be video. To handle the growth in mobile networks, the next generation
  of 5G mobile networks is designed to have higher access rates and an increased densification
  of the network infrastructure. With the explosion of access rates and number of
  base stations the backhaul of wireless networks will become congested. To reduce
  the load on the backhaul, the research community suggests installing local caches
  in gateway routers between the wireless network and the Internet, in base stations
  of different sizes, and in end-user devices. The local deployment of caches allows
  keeping the traffic within the ISPs network. The caches are organized in a hierarchy,
  where caches in the lowest tier are requested first. The request is forwarded to
  the next tier, if the requested object is not found. Appropriate evaluation methods
  are required to optimally dimension the caches dependent on the traffic characteristics
  and the available resources. Additionally methods are necessary that allow performance
  evaluation of backhaul bandwidth aggregation systems, which further reduce the load
  on the backhaul. This thesis analyses CDNs utilizing locally available resources
  and develops the following evaluations and optimization approaches: Characterization
  of CDNs and distribution of resources in the Internet, analysis and optimization
  of hierarchical caching systems with bandwidth constraints and performance evaluation
  of bandwidth aggregation systems.'

ABS: Sonification systems, in which data are represented through sound, have the potential
  to be useful in a number of network-security monitoring applications in Security
  Operations Centres (SOCs). Security analysts working in SOCs generally monitor networks
  using a combination of anomaly-detection techniques, Intrusion Detection Systems
  and data presented in visual and text-based forms. In the last two decades significant
  progress has been made in developing novel sonification systems to further support
  network-monitoring tasks, but many of these systems have not been sufficiently validated,
  and there is a lack of uptake in SOCs. Furthermore, little guidance exists on design
  requirements for the sonification of network data. In this paper, we identify the
  key role that sonification, if implemented correctly, could play in addressing shortcomings
  of traditional network-monitoring methods. Based on a review of prior research,
  we propose an approach to developing sonification systems for network monitoring.
  This approach involves the formalisation of a model for designing sonifications
  in this space; identification of sonification design aesthetics suitable for real
  time network monitoring; and system refinement and validation through comprehensive
  user testing. As an initial step in this system development, we present a formalised
  model for designing sonifications for network-security monitoring. The application
  of this model is demonstrated through our development of prototype sonification
  systems for two different use-cases within network security monitoring.

ABS: Global interconnectivity of systems has left inter-networked systems vulnerable
  to various forms of complex attacks. Researchers continue to work on new ways, which
  includes proactive ones of securing such systems, in order to eradicate or minimise
  security threats. One of such attempts is network attack prediction systems. Distributed
  Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a class of network attack that can span several
  continents. It floods the computer network with heavy loads of unwanted packets
  and requests that weigh down the system resources such as memory and processors.
  Hidden Markov model (HMM) is one of the models that can be used to predict and detect
  such attacks. Issues associated with the use of HMM are determination of the hidden
  and observable states and subsequently, the model parameters estimation since the
  performance of the model depends on the accurate selection of these parameters.
  Related issue is the need to overcome long training time of the traditional HMM
  algorithm especially during model construction as well as ensuring that the learning
  algorithm does not converge to a local maximum. This study presents a novel parsimonious
  HMM-based model in which the entropy-based values of the network traffic features
  and the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack phases form the observable and
  the hidden states of the model, respectively. Entropy and K-Means clustering were
  deployed respectively to determine the observable and hidden states that characterise
  the HMM. In order to improve computational efficiency of the algorithm for estimating
  the parameters of the model, Kullback-Liebler Divergence (KLD) method was employed
  for reducing and selecting appropriate parameters to achieve a good prediction model.
  Variational Bayesian Inference (VBI) was employed in optimising the HMM. The performance
  of the model was evaluated through experiments using DARPA 2000 Intrusion Specific
  dataset, DARPA 1999 dataset and CAIDA 2007 simulated real time DDoS attack data.
  The experimental results when compared with an existing work, where Markov Chain
  was used, show that the model gives faster and higher prediction accuracy for predicting
  DDoS attack. Specifically, the prediction accuracy, false positive rate and false
  negative rate show 10%, 11% and 9% improvement, respectively while the computational
  time was reduced by 42%.

ABS: Efficiently solving the problem of computing, in a distributed fashion, the shortest

  and Link-State algorithms. Distance-Vector algorithms are widely adopted solutions
  when scalability and reliability are key issues or when nodes have either limited
  hardware resources, as they result in being very competitive approaches in terms
  of both the memory and the computational point of view. In this paper, we first
  survey some of the most established solutions of the Distance-Vector category. Then,
  we discuss some recent algorithmic developments in this area. Finally, we propose
  a new experimental study, conducted on a prominent category of network instances,
  namely generalized linear preference (GLP) power-law networks, to rank the performance
  of such solutions.

  collected by monitoring close to 16.5 million darknet IP addresses from a /8 and
  a /13 network telescopes. First, the paper offers a novel probabilistic darknet
  preprocessing model, which aims at sanitizing darknet data to prepare it for effective
  use in the task of cyber threat intelligence generation. Such model has been engineered
  using a distributed multithreaded approach, rendering it highly effective on darknet
  big data. Second, the paper further contributes by presenting an innovative approach
  to infer large-scale orchestrated probing campaigns by leveraging darknet data,
  for Internet cyber situational awareness. The approach uniquely reduces the dimensionality
  of such big data by utilizing its artifacts, instead of processing the actual raw
  data. This is accomplished by extracting and analyzing probing time series using
  formal methods rooted in Fourier transform and Kalman filtering. Thorough empirical
  evaluations indeed validate the accuracy and the performance of the proposed methods.
  We assert that such approaches are of significant value, given their highly applicable
  nature to the field of Internet measurements for cyber security in the era of big
  data.

ABS: The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) computes routes between the organizational
  networks that make up todays Internet. Unfortunately, BGP suffers from deficiencies,
  including slow convergence, security problems, a lack of innovation, and the leakage
  of sensitive information about domains routing preferences. To overcome some of
  these problems, we revisit the idea of centralizing and using secure multi-party
  computation (MPC) for interdomain routing which was proposed by Gupta et al. (ACM
  HotNets12). We implement two algorithms for interdomain routing with state-of-the-art
  MPC protocols. On an empirically derived dataset that approximates the topology
  of todays Internet (55 809 nodes), our protocols take as little as 6 s of topology-independent
  precomputation and only 3 s of online time. We show, moreover, that when our MPC
  approach is applied at country/region-level scale, runtimes can be as low as 0.17
  s online time and 0.20 s pre-computation time. Our results motivate the MPC approach
  for interdomain routing and furthermore demonstrate that current MPC techniques
  are capable of efficiently tackling real-world problems at a large scale.

ABS: Despite extensive studies on the Internet topology, little is still known about
  the AS level topology of the African Internet, especially when it comes to its IXP
  substrate. The main reason for this is the lack of vantage points that are needed
  to obtain the proper information. From 2013 to 2016, we enhanced the RIPE Atlas
  measurement infrastructure in the region to shed light on both IPv4 and IPv6 topologies
  interconnecting local ISPs. We increased the number of vantage points in Africa
  by 278.3% and carried out measurements between them at random periods. To infer
  results that depict the behavior of ISPs in the region, we propose reproducible
  traceroute data analysis techniques suitable for the treatment of any set of similar
  measurements. We first reveal a large variety of ISP transit habits and their dependence
  on socio-economic factors. We then compare QoS within African countries, European
  countries, and the US to find that West African networks in particular need to promote
  investments in fiber networks and to implement traffic engineering techniques. Our
  results indicate the remaining dominance of ISPs based outside Africa for the provision
  of intra-continental paths, but also shed light on traffic localization efforts.
  We map, in our traceroute data, 62.2% of the IXPs in Africa and infer their respective
  peers. Finally, we highlight the launch of new IXPs and quantify their impacts on
  end-to-end connectivity. The study clearly demonstrates that to better assess interdomain
  routing in a continent, it is necessary to perform measurements from a diversified
  range of vantage points.

ABS: This paper presents the design and data-driven overhead analysis of PrefiSec,
  a distributed framework that helps collaborating organizations to effectively maintain
  and share network information in the fight against miscreants. PrefiSec is a novel
  distributed IP-prefix-based solution, which maintains information about the activities
  associated with IP prefixes (blocks of IP addresses) and autonomous systems (AS)
  and enables efficient sharing of this information between participants. Within PrefiSec,
  we design and evaluate simple and scalable mechanisms that help to protect against
  prefixisubprefix attacks and interception attacks, and enable sharing of prefix
  related information related to a wide range of edge-based attacks, such as spamming
  and scanning. We also include an evaluation of which ASes need to collaborate, to
  what extent the size and locality of ASes matter, and how many ASes are needed to
  achieve good efficiency in detecting anomalous route announcements. Public wide-area
  BGP-announcements, traceroutes, and simulations are used to estimate the overhead,
  scalability, and alert rates. Our results show that PrefiSec helps improve system
  security, and can scale to large systems.

ABS: Video streaming dominates the Internets overall traffic mix, with reports stating
  that it will constitute 90% of all consumer traffic by 2019. Most of this video
  is delivered by Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and, while they optimize QoE metrics
  such as buffering ratio and start-up time, no single CDN provides optimal performance.
  In this paper we make the case for elastic CDNs, the ability to build virtual CDNs
  on-the-fly on top of shared, third-party infrastructure at a scale. To bring this
  idea closer to reality we begin by large-scale simulations to quantify the effects
  that elastic CDNs would have if deployed, and build and evaluate MiniCache, a specialized,
  minimalistic virtualized content cache that runs on the Xen hypervisor. MiniCache
  is able to serve content at rates of up to 32 Gb/s and handle up to 600K reqs/sec
  on a single CPU core, as well as boot in about 90 milliseconds on x86 and around
  370 milliseconds on ARM32.

  Comments Table of Contents Scalability of network processor-based routers heavily
  depends on limitations imposed by memory accesses and associated power consumption.
  Bandwidth shaping of a flow is a key function, which requires a token bucket per
  output queue and abuses memory bandwidth. As the number of output queues increases,
  managing token buckets becomes prohibitively expensive and limits scalability. In
  this work, we propose a scalable software-based token bucket management scheme that
  can reduce memory accesses and power consumption significantly. To satisfy real-time
  and low-cost constraints, we propose novel parallel heap data structures running
  on a manycore-based network processor. By using cache locking, the performance of
  heap processing is enhanced significantly and is more predictable. In addition,
  we quantitatively analyze the performance and memory footprint of the proposed software
  scheme using stochastic modeling and the Lyapunov central limit theorem. Finally,
  the proposed scheme provides an adaptive method to limit the size of heaps in the
  case of oversubscribed queues, which can successfully isolate the queues showing
  unideal behavior. The proposed scheme reduces memory accesses by up to three orders
  of magnitude for one million queues sharing a 100Gbps interface of the router while
  maintaining stability under stressful scenarios.

ABS: 'Methods for topological link-prediction are generally referred as global or
  local. The former exploits the entire network topology, the latter adopts only the
  immediate neighbourhood of the link to predict. Global methods are believed to be
  the best performing. Is this common belief well-founded? Stochastic-Block-Model
  (SBM) is a global method believed as one of the best link-predictors and widely
  accepted as reference when new methods are proposed. But, our results suggest that
  SBM, whose computational time is high, cannot in general overcome the Cannistraci-Hebb
  (CH) network automaton model that is a simple local-learning-rule of topological
  self-organization proved by multiple sources as the current best local-based and
  parameter-free deterministic rule for link-prediction. In order to elucidate the
  reasons of this unexpected result, we formally introduce the notion of local-ring
  network automata models and their tight relation with the nature of common-neighbours
  definition in complex network theory. In addition, after extensive tests, we recommend
  Structural-Perturbation-Method (SPM) as the new best global method baseline. However,
  even SPM overall does not outperform CH and in several evaluation frameworks we
  astonishingly found the opposite. In particular, CH was the best predictor for synthetic
  networks generated by the Popularity-Similarity-Optimization (PSO) model, and its
  performance in PSO networks with community structure was even better than using
  the original internode-hyperbolic-distance as link-predictor. Interestingly, when
  tested on non-hyperbolic synthetic networks the performance of CH significantly
  dropped down indicating that this rule of network self-organization could be strongly
  associated to the rise of hyperbolic geometry in complex networks. In conclusion,
  we warn the scientific community: the superiority of global methods in link-prediction
  seems a misleading belief caused by a latent geometry bias of the few small networks
  used as benchmark in previous studies. Therefore, we urge the need to found a latent
  geometry theory of link-prediction in complex network'

ABS: The urgently growing number of security threats on Internet and intranet networks
  highly demands reliable security solutions. Among various options, Intrusion Detection
  (IDSs) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) are used to defend network infrastructure
  by detecting and preventing attacks and malicious activities. The performance of
  a detection system is evaluated using benchmark datasets. There exist a number of
  datasets, such as DARPA98, KDD99, ISC2012, and ADFA13, that have been used by researchers
  to evaluate the performance of their intrusion detection and prevention approaches.
  However, not enough research has focused on the evaluation and assessment of the
  datasets themselves and there is no reliable dataset in this domain. In this paper,
  we present a comprehensive evaluation of the existing datasets using our proposed
  criteria, a design and evaluation framework for IDS and IPS datasets, and a dataset
  generation model to create a reliable IDS or IPS benchmark dataset.

ABS: Over the past decade, numerous systems have been proposed to detect and subsequently
  prevent or mitigate security vulnerabilities. However, many existing intrusion or
  anomaly detection solutions are limited to a subset of the traffic due to scalability
  issues, hence failing to operate at line-rate on large, highspeed datacentre networks.
  In this paper, we present a two-level solution for anomaly detection leveraging
  independent execution and message passing semantics. We employ these constructs
  within a network-wide distributed anomaly detection framework that allows for greater
  detection accuracy and bandwidth cost saving through attack path reconstruction.Experimental
  results using real operational traffic traces and known network attacks generated
  through the Pytbull IDS evaluation framework, show that our approach is capable
  of detecting anomalies in a timely manner while allowing reconstruction of the attack
  path, hence further enabling the composition of advanced mitigation strategies.
  The resulting system shows high detection accuracy when compared to similar techniques,
  at least 20% better at detecting anomalies, and enables full path reconstruction
  even at small-to-moderate attack traffic intensities (as a fraction of the total
  traffic), saving up to 75% of bandwidth due to early attack detection

ABS: This work describes a clean-slate inter-domain routing protocol designed to meet
  the needs of the future mobile Internet. In particular, we describe the edge-aware
  inter-domain routing (EIR) protocol which provides new abstractions of aggregated-nodes
  (aNodes) and virtual-links (vLinks) for expressing network topologies and edge network
  properties necessary to address next-generation mobility related routing scenarios
  which are inadequately supported by the border gateway protocol (BGP) in use today.
  Specific use-cases addressed by EIR include emerging mobility service scenarios
  such as multi-homing across WiFi and cellular, multipath routing over several access
  networks, and anycast access from mobile devices to replicated cloud services. Simulation
  results for protocol overhead are presented for a global-scale Caida topology, leading
  to an identification of parameters necessary to obtain a good balance between overhead
  and routing table convergence time. A Click-based proof-of-concept implementation
  of EIR on the ORBIT testbed is described and used to validate performance and functionality
  for selected mobility use-cases, including mobile data services with open WiFi access
  points and mobile platforms such as buses operating in an urban area.

  No traffic should arrive there, but it does in overwhelming quantities, gathering

  network traffic data evolves quickly and is of high volume and diversity, i.e.,
  an outstanding big data challenge. When used to assist network security, it also
  requires the online classification of dynamic streaming data. In this paper, we
  introduce an AGgregation and Mode (AGM) vector to represent network traffic. The
  AGM format characterizes IP hosts by extracting aggregated and mode values of IP
  header fields, and without inspecting payloads. We performed clustering and statistical
  analysis to explore six months of IBR from 2012 with the AGM mapping. The discovered
  patterns allow building a classification of IBR, which identifies phenomena that

  arduous, because this form of attack has high degree of concealment and the dynamic
  distributivity. In this paper, the characteristics of software defined network and
  the characteristics of DDoS attacks are analyzed and researched. An improved DDoS
  attack detection method is proposed, which is different from the traditional method
  that only detects the single link and network for the victims. Based on the software
  defined network (SDN), classification learning algorithm is used to detect DDoS
  attacks online through the construction of an efficient global network flow table
  feature values, and combined with the feature selection algorithm that can optimize

ABS: 'Recently, the energy consumption of Ethernet has become one of the hottest topics
  focused by both academic committee and industry, especially with the increase of
  the link speed from 1Gbps to 10/40Gbps nowadays or even 100/400Gbps in the near
  future. To save the energy consumed by the Ethernet, the Energy Efficient Ethernet
  (EEE) is developed and standardized by the IEEE 802.3az work group. When there is
  no incoming traffic, the EEE can saves 90% of its energy consumption by entering
  into the Low Power Idle (LPI) mode. To maximize the energy saving of Ethernet, the
  Burst TRansmission (BTR) mechanism, which defines a new way to utilize the LPI mode,
  is developed as a mechanism for EEE. Prior work theoretically shows that the BTR
  mechanism makes a tradeoff between the energy saving and the queuing delay. However,
  the traffic pattern, on which the performance of EEE greatly depends, is assumed
  to be deterministic in their analyses. Besides, their models made estimation for
  many situations. In this paper, we model EEE with the BTR mechanism and provide
  analytical understanding on the BTR mechanism. We propose two actual models: one
  focuses on the buffer size limit, the other concentrates on tolerable packet delay
  additionally. We draw some guidelines of parameter selection and policies design
  for EEE from combination of theory conclusions and simulation results. The results
  show that the saved energy can be constrained by link occupancy even though the
  buffer size is variational. The buffer full triggered wake-up policy can achieve
  ideal ratio of energy consumption and arrival rate within the scope of the buffer
  as well. However, the tolerable delay cannot be guaranteed by any policies. The
  buffer size is even fixed, which affects the flexibility of demanded delay for different
  business. The policy considering tolerable delay is supposed to be a little better
  than the other policy, with a little more complicated design. Thus we design an
  adaptive mechanism both in quantitative and qualitative: detect the load utilization,
  apply the buffer full triggered wake-up policy for higher load utilization link,
  while applying the buffer full and timeout triggered wake-up policy for the delay
  sensitive business and tiny arrival rate.'

ABS: 'Despite a Network Anomaly Detection System (NADS) being capable of detecting
  existing and zero-day attacks, it is still not universally implemented in industry
  and real applications, with current systems producing high False Positive Rates
  (FPRs) and low Detection Rates (DRs). The challenges involved in designing a NADS
  architecture are 1) the methodology adopted for creating as comprehensive a profile
  as possible from diverse normal patterns and 2) in establishing an adaptive and
  lightweight Decision Engine (DE) which efficiently distinguishes between legitimate
  and anomalous activities at high speeds in large network environments. The need
  for such a method to be trained and validated on a decent dataset with the characteristics
  of current network environments is a significant challenge. This thesis provides
  substantial contributions to research on the building of a scalable, adaptive and
  lightweight NADS framework. It considers three aspects: a data source, relevant
  features and observations, and new DE approaches for achieving a reliable NADS architecture.
  The first key contribution is the creation of a new dataset called UNSWNB15 that
  has a hybrid of realistic modern legitimate and synthetic malicious activities,
  with statistical analyses and evaluations of it fully explained. Also, its complexity
  is assessed using existing techniques to demonstrate the extent of current sophisticated
  types of anomalous events. The second core contribution is the development of a
  new theory for selecting important features and observations from network packets
  without redundancy to construct a legitimate profile from which any deviation is
  considered an attack, that is, establish an efficient NADS from analyses of the
  protocols and services of the OSI model. The third major contribution is the development
  of two scalable frameworks with two new DE techniques for successfully detecting
  malicious activities in less processing times than current methods. These techniques,
  called the Geometric Area Analysis-ADS (GAA-ADS) and Dirichlet Mixture Model-ADS
  (DMM-ADS), are based on mixture models for modelling all possible normal patterns
  and detecting abnormal events that deviate from them using new outlier approaches.'

ABS: The internet data traffic is tripling every two years; due to the exponential

  by determining the flow of the packet, based on various rule checking mechanisms
  that are performed on the packet headers. However, the memory components like TCAMs
  used by these various rules are very expensive and power hungry. Henceforth, the
  current IP Lookup algorithms implemented in hardware are even though able to achieve
  multi-gigabit speeds, yet suffer with great memory overhead. To overcome this limitation,
  we propose a packet classification methodology that comprises of MicroCuckoo-hash
  technique, to route packets. This approach alleviates the memory requirements significantly,
  by completely eliminating the need for TCAM cells. Cuckoo hash is used to achieve
  very high speed, hardware accelerated table lookups and also are economical compared
  to TCAMs. The proposed IP Lookup algorithm is implemented as a simulation-based
  hardware/software model. This model is developed, tested and synthesized using Vivado

ABS: The design and implementation of cryptographic systems offer many subtle pitfalls.
  One such pitfall is that cryptography may create unique identifiers potentially
  usable to repeatedly and precisely re-identify and hence track users. This work
  investigates TLS Client Certificate Authentication (CCA), which currently transmits
  certificates in plain text. We demonstrate CCAs impact on client traceability using
  Apples Apple Push Notification service (APNs) as an example. APNs is used by all
  Apple products, employs plain-text CCA, and aims to be constantly connected to its
  backend. Its novel combination of large device count, constant connections, device
  proximity to users and unique client certificates provides for precise client traceability.
  We show that passive eavesdropping allows to precisely re-identify and track users
  and that only ten interception points are required to track more than 80 percent
  of APNs users due to global routing characteristics. We conduct our work under strong
  ethical guidelines, responsibly disclose our findings, and can confirm a working
  patch by Apple for the highlighted issue. We aim for this work to provide the necessary
  factual and quantified evidence about negative implications of plain-text CCA to
  boost deployment of encrypted CCA as in TLS 1.3.

ABS: 'Geographically locating an IP address is of interest for many purposes. There
  are two major ways to obtain the location of an IP address: querying commercial
  databases or conducting latency measurements. For structural Internet nodes, such
  as routers, commercial databases are limited by low accuracy, while current measurement-based
  approaches overwhelm users with setup overhead and scalability issues. In this work
  we present our system HLOC, aiming to combine the ease of database use with the
  accuracy of latency measurements. We evaluate HLOC on a comprehensive router data
  set of 1.4M IPv4 and 183k IPv6 routers. HLOC first extracts location hints from
  rDNS names, and then conducts multi-tier latency measurements. Configuration complexity
  is minimized by using publicly available large-scale measurement frameworks such
  as RIPE Atlas. Using this measurement, we can confirm or disprove the location hints
  found in domain names. We publicly release HLOCs ready-to-use source code, enabling
  researchers to easily increase geolocation accuracy with minimum overhead.'

ABS: Cloud computing has been widely adopted by application service providers (ASPs)
  and enterprises to reduce both capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational expenditures
  (OPEX). Applications and services previously running on private data centers are
  now being migrated to private or public clouds. Since most of the ASPs and enterprises
  have globally distributed user bases, their services need to be distributed across
  multiple clouds, spread across the globe which can achieve better performance in
  terms of latency, scalability and load balancing. The shift has eventually led the
  research community to study multi-cloud environments. However, the widespread acceptance
  of such environments has been hampered by major security concerns. Firewalls and
  traditional rule-based security protection techniques are not sufficient to protect
  user-data in multi-cloud scenarios. Recently, advances in machine learning techniques
  have attracted the attention of the research community to build intrusion detection
  systems (IDS) that can detect anomalies in the network traffic. Most of the research
  works, however, do not differentiate among different types of attacks. This is,
  in fact, necessary for appropriate countermeasures and defense against attacks.
  In this paper, we investigate both detecting and categorizing anomalies rather than
  just detecting, which is a common trend in the contemporary research works. We have
  used a popular publicly available dataset to build and test learning models for
  both detection and categorization of different attacks. To be precise, we have used
  two supervised machine learning techniques, namely linear regression (LR) and random
  forest (RF). We show that even if detection is perfect, categorization can be less
  accurate due to similarities between attacks. Our results demonstrate more than
  99% detection accuracy and categorization accuracy of 93.6%, with the inability
  to categorize some attacks. Further, we argue that such categorization can be applied
  to multi-cloud environments using the same machine learning techniques.

ABS: A proposal to improve routing security---Route Origin Authorization (ROA)---has
  been standardized. A ROA specifies which network is allowed to announce a set of
  Internet destinations. While some networks now specify ROAs, little is known about
  whether other networks check routes they receive against these ROAs, a process known
  as Route Origin Validation (ROV). Which networks blindly accept invalid routes?
  Which reject them outright? Which de-preference them if alternatives exist? Recent
  analysis attempts to use uncontrolled experiments to characterize ROV adoption by
  comparing valid routes and invalid routes. However, we argue that gaining a solid
  understanding of ROV adoption is impossible using currently available data sets
  and techniques. Our measurements suggest that, although some ISPs are not observed
  using invalid routes in uncontrolled experiments, they are actually using different
  routes for (non-security) traffic engineering purposes, without performing ROV.
  We conclude with a description of a controlled, verifiable methodology for measuring
  ROV and present three ASes that do implement ROV, confirmed by operators.

GEOLOC: Liege, BE
ABS: Since the early 2000s, the Internet Topology has been frequently described and
  modeled from the perspective of routers. To this end, alias resolution mechanisms
  have been developed in order to aggregate all IP interfaces of a router, collected
  with traceroute, into a single identifier. So far, many active measurement techniques
  have been considered, often taking advantage of specific features from network protocols.
  However, a lot of these methods have seen their efficiency decrease over time due
  to security reinforcements across the Internet. In this paper, we introduce a generic
  methodology to conduct efficient and scalable alias resolution. It combines the
  space search reduction of TreeNET (a tool for efficiently discovering subnets) with
  a fingerprinting process used to assess the feasibility of several state-of-the-art
  alias resolution methods, using a small, fixed amount of probes. We validate our
  method along MIDAR on an academic groundtruth and demonstrate that our methodology
  can achieve similar accuracy while using less probes and discovering subnets in
  the process. We further evaluate our method with measurements made on PlanetLab
  towards several distinct ASes of varying sizes and roles in the Internet. The collected
  data shows that some properties of our fingerprints correlate with each other, hinting
  some observed profiles could be linked with equipment vendors. Both TreeNET (which
  implements our methodology) and our dataset are freely available.

ABS: Ads (advertisements) have become a common source of revenues for websites and
  transformed the web hosting ecosystem. This paper reports an extensive measurement-based
  study of web hosting with an explicit focus on differences in the hosting of ads
  versus regular contents. Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) service and 22,040
  open recursive DNS (Domain Name System) resolvers, we collect contents of top country-specific
  websites in 52 countries around the globe and characterize the hosting infrastructures.
  While we observe that ads employ more servers for broader load distribution, replication
  is local for ads and global for regular contents. Our results clearly show that
  transit ASes (Autonomous Systems), including the tier-1 networks, diversify their
  economic roles and prominently provide web hosting. A small number of ASes dominate
  heavily in the byte volume of hosted contents, with the top hosts being different
  for ads and regular contents. Compared to ASes and organizations, the distribution
  of hosting countries is even more heavily skewed, with the USA consistently taking
  the overwhelmingly dominant position. While ads have shorter response times, their
  download times are longer because websites are developed to serve requests for regular
  contents with a higher priority.

ABS: The mechanism for picking guards in Tor suffers from security problems like guard
  fingerprinting and from performance issues. To address these issues, Hayes and Danezis
  proposed the use of guard sets, in which the Tor system groups all guards into sets,
  and each client picks one of these sets and uses its guards. Unfortunately, guard
  sets frequently need nodes added or they are broken up due to fluctuations in network
  bandwidth. In this paper, we first show that these breakups create opportunities
  for malicious guards to join many guard sets by merely tuning the bandwidth they
  make available to Tor, and this greatly increases the number of clients exposed
  to malicious guards. To address this problem, we propose a new method for forming
  guard sets based on Internet location. We construct a hierarchy that keeps clients
  and guards together more reliably and prevents guards from easily joining arbitrary
  guard sets. This approach also has the advantage of confining an attacker with access
  to limited locations on the Internet to a small number of guard sets. We simulate
  this guard set design using historical Tor data in the presence of both relay-level
  adversaries and network-level adversaries, and we find that our approach is good
  at confining the adversary into few guard sets and thus limiting the impact of attacks.

ABS: Because traffic is predominantly formed by communication between users or between
  users and servers which communicate with users, network traffic inherently exhibits
  social networking behaviour; the extent of interaction between entities - as identified
  by their IP addresses - can be extracted from the data and analysed in a multiplicity
  of ways. In this paper, Anonymized Internet Trace Datasets obtained from the Center
  for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) have been used to identify and estimate
  characteristics of the underlying social network from the overall traffic. The analysis
  methods used here fall into two groups, the first being based on frequency analysis
  and second method being based on the use of traffic matrices, with the latter analysis
  method being further sub-divided into groups based on the traffic mean, variance
  and covariance. The frequency analysis of origin, destination and O-D Pair statistics
  exhibit heavy tailed behaviour. Because the large number of IP addresses contained
  in the CAIDA Datasets, only the most predominate IP Addresses are used when estimating
  all three sub-divided groups of traffic matrices. Principal Component Analysis and
  related methods are applied to identify key features of each type of traffic matrix.
  A new system called Antraff has been developed by the authors to carry out all the
  analysis procedures.

TOPKEY: topology-as-relationships
GEOLOC: Pasadena, CA, US
ABS: We consider algorithms for distributed optimization and their applications. In
  this thesis, we propose a new approach for distributed optimization based on an
  emerging area of theoretical computer science - local computation algorithms. The
  approach is fundamentally different from existing methodologies and provides a number
  of benefits, such as robustness to link failure and adaptivity to dynamic settings.
  Specifically, we develop an algorithm, LOCO, that given a convex optimization problem
  P with n variables and a sparse linear constraint matrix with m constraints, provably
  finds a solution as good as that of the best online algorithm for P using only O(log(n
  + m)) messages with high probability. The approach is not iterative and communication
  is restricted to a localized neighborhood. In addition to analytic results, we show
  numerically that the performance improvements over classical approaches for distributed
  optimization are significant, e.g., it uses orders of magnitude less communication
  than ADMM. We also consider the operations of a geographically distributed cloud
  data market. We consider design decisions that include which data to purchase (data
  purchasing) and where to place or replicate the data for delivery (data placement).
  We show that a joint approach to data purchasing and data placement within a cloud
  data market improves operating costs. This problem can be viewed as a facility location
  problem, and is thus NP-hard. However, we give a provably optimal algorithm for
  the case of a data market consisting of a single data center, and then generalize
  the result from the single data center setting in order to develop a near-optimal,
  polynomial-time algorithm for a geo-distributed data market. The resulting design,
  Datum, decomposes the joint purchasing and placement problem into two subproblems,
  one for data purchasing and one for data placement, using a transformation of the
  underlying bandwidth costs. We show, via a case study, that Datum is near-optimal
  (within 1.6%) in practical settings.

ABS: The Internet topology is of high importance in designing networks and architectures,
  evaluating performance, and economics. Interconnections between domains (ASes),
  routers, and points of presence (PoPs), have been measured, analyzed, and modeled.
  However, existing models have some serious shortcomings, related to ease, accuracy
  and completeness of measurements, and limited applicability to emerging research
  areas. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel approach towards capturing
  the inter-domain Internet topology. Motivated by the recent interest in the Internet
  eXchange Points (IXPs), we introduce a network graph model based on IXPs and their
  AS memberships. The proposed model aims to complement previous modeling efforts,
  shed light on unexplored characteristics of the Internet topology, and support new
  research directions. We also collect and make available Internet connectivity data,
  analyze main topological properties, and discuss application-related issues.

ABS: Recent years have seen the Internet become a key vehicle for citizens around
  the globe to express political opinions and organize protests. This fact has not
  gone unnoticed, with countries around the world repurposing network management tools
  (e.g., URL filtering products) and protocols (e.g., BGP, DNS) for censorship. However,
  repurposing these products can have unintended international impact, which we refer
  to as censorship leakage. While there have been anecdotal reports of censorship
  leakage, there has yet to be a systematic study of censorship leakage at a global
  scale. In this paper, we combine a global censorship measurement platform (ICLab)
  with a general-purpose technique -- boolean network tomography -- to identify which
  AS on a network path is performing censorship. At a high-level, our approach exploits
  BGP churn to narrow down the set of potential censoring ASes by over 95%. We exactly
  identify 65 censoring ASes and find that the anomalies introduced by 24 of the 65
  censoring ASes have an impact on users located in regions outside the jurisdiction
  of the censoring AS, resulting in the leaking of regional censorship policies.

ABS: 'Accurate information about address and block usage in the Internet has many
  applications in planning address allocation, topology studies, and simulations.
  Prior studies used active probing, sometimes augmented with passive observation,
  to study macroscopic phenomena, such as the overall usage of the IPv4 address space.
  This paper instead studies the completeness of passive sources: how well they can
  observe microscopic phenomena such as address usage within a given network. We define
  sparsity as the limitation of a given monitor to see a target, and we quantify the
  effects of interest, temporal, and coverage sparsity. To study sparsity, we introduce
  inverted analysis, a novel approach that uses complete passive observations of a
  few end networks (three campus networks in our case) to infer what of these networks
  would be seen by millions of virtual monitors near their traffics destinations.
  Unsurprisingly, we find that monitors near popular content see many more targets
  and that visibility is strongly influenced by bipartite traffic between clients
  and servers. We are the first to quantify these effects and show their implications
  for the study of Internet liveness from passive observations. We find that visibility
  is heavy-tailed, with only 0.5% monitors seeing more than 10% of our targets addresses,
  and is most affected by interest sparsity over temporal and coverage sparsity. Visibility
  is also strongly bipartite. Monitors of a different class than a target (e.g., a
  server monitor observing a client target) outperform monitors of the same class
  as a target in 82-99% of cases in our datasets. Finally, we find that adding active
  probing to passive observations greatly improves visibility of both server and client
  target addresses, but is not critical for visibility of target blocks. Our findings
  are valuable to understand limitations of existing measurement studies, and to develop
  methods to maximize microscopic completeness in future studies.'

  paper proposes a new Bloom filter variant called Ultra-Fast Bloom Filters, by leveraging
  the SIMD techniques. We make three improvements for the UFBF to accelerate the membership
  check speed. First, we develop a novel hash computation algorithm which can compute
  multiple hash functions in parallel with the use of SIMD instructions. Second, we
  change a Bloom filters bit-test process from sequential to parallel. Third, we increase
  the cache efficiency of membership check by encoding an elements information to
  a small block which can easily fit into a cache-line. Both theoretical analysis
  and extensive simulations show that the UFBF greatly exceeds the state-of-the-art
  Bloom filter variants on membership check speed.

ABS: 'As the most successful cryptocurrency to date, Bitcoin constitutes a target
  of choice for attackers. While many attack vectors have already been uncovered,
  one important vector has been left out though: attacking the currency via the Internet
  routing infrastructure itself. Indeed, by manipulating routing advertisements (BGP
  hijacks) or by naturally intercepting traffic, Autonomous Systems (ASes) can intercept
  and manipulate a large fraction of Bitcoin traffic. This paper presents the first
  taxonomy of routing attacks and their impact on Bitcoin, considering both small-scale
  attacks, targeting individual nodes, and large-scale attacks, targeting the network
  as a whole. While challenging, we show that two key properties make routing attacks
  practical: (i) the efficiency of routing manipulation; and (ii) the significant
  centralization of Bitcoin in terms of mining and routing. Specifically, we find
  that any network attacker can hijack few (<100) BGP prefixes to isolate a1/450%
  of the mining poweraeven when considering that mining pools are heavily multi-homed.
  We also show that on-path network attackers can considerably slow down block propagation
  by interfering with few key Bitcoin messages. We demonstrate the feasibility of
  each attack against the deployed Bitcoin software. We also quantify their effectiveness
  on the current Bitcoin topology using data collected from a Bitcoin supernode combined
  with BGP routing data. The potential damage to Bitcoin is worrying. By isolating
  parts of the network or delaying block propagation, attackers can cause a significant
  amount of mining power to be wasted, leading to revenue losses and enabling a wide
  range of exploits such as double spending. To prevent such effects in practice,
  we provide both short and long-term countermeasures, some of which can be deployed
  immediately'

  network resources are not wasted in propagating the attack. RPI-HA identifies the
  most effective points in the network where the filter can be placed to minimize
  attack traffic in the network and maximize legitimate traffic for the victim during
  the attack period. Extensive OPNET A(c)A(c) based simulations with a real network
  topology and CAIDA attack data set shows that the method is able to place all filtering
  routers within three routers of the attacker nodes and stop 95% of attack traffic
  while allowing 77% of legitimate traffic to reach victim node.

ABS: We propose high-frequency traffic control (HFTraC), a rate control scheme that
  coordinates the transmission rates and buffer utilizations in routers network-wide
  at fast timescale. HFTraC can effectively deal with traffic demand fluctuation by
  utilizing available buffer space in routers network-wide, and therefore lead to
  significant performance improvement in terms of tradeoff between bandwidth utilization
  and queueing delay. We further note that the performance limit of HFTraC is determined
  by the network architecture used to implement it. We provide trace-driven evaluation
  of the performance of HFTraC implemented in the proposed architectures that vary
  from fully centralized to completely decentralized.

ABS: Network level surveillance, censorship, and various man-in-the-middle attacks
  target only specific types of network traffic (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, VoIP, or Email).
  Therefore, packets of these types will likely receive special treatment by a transit
  network or a man-in-the-middle attacker. A transit Internet Service Provider (ISP)
  or an attacker may pass the targeted traffic through special software or equipment
  to gather data or perform an attack. This creates a measurable difference between
  the performance of the targeted traffic versus the general case. In networking terms,
  it violates the principle of network neutrality, which states that all traffic should
  be treated equally. Many techniques were designed to detect network neutrality violations,
  and some have naturally suggested using them to detect surveillance and censorship.
  In this article, we show that the existing network neutrality measurement techniques
  can be easily detected and therefore circumvented. We then briefly propose a new
  approach to overcome the drawbacks of current measurement techniques.

ABS: In the past two decades, there has been a fast growth in the heterogeneous wired-wireless
  network which connects variety of networks such as wired network, wireless network,
  high speed network and sensor network with the Internet. Since the wired network
  and wireless network use the different technologies, there is a necessity of developing
  new protocols or redesigning of existing protocols. Transmission Control Protocol
  is redesigned to achieve the reliable and effective communication in the heterogeneous
  wired-wireless network. The basic assumption made in Transmission Control Protocol
  is that the packet losses are caused by the network congestion but in case of wireless
  network, the packet losses may be due to temporary link failure, high BitError-Rate
  etc. Hence the congestion avoidance algorithm of Transmission Control Protocol needs
  to be redesigned to cope with heterogeneous wired-wireless network. Therefore in
  this paper, we propose a congestion avoidance algorithm which differentiates the
  cause of packet losses. The essential components of proposed algorithm are round-trip-time
  estimation, backlogged packet estimation, channel status notification, loss differentiation
  algorithm and congestion window control. A round-trip-time estimation using ARIMA(2,1,1)
  model is proposed in this paper which estimates the sudden changes in the round
  trip time. It helps us to estimate the backlogged packet and thereby differentiating
  the congestive packet loss from noncongestive packet loss. In addition, we use the
  received signal strength of wireless receiver to differentiate the packet losses.
  Based on the packet loss differentiation, the congestion window size is controlled
  to avoid the congestion in the network. The proposed algorithm is simulated using
  network simulator under different network environments. From the simulation results,
  it is realized that the proposed congestion avoidance algorithm performs well in
  the heterogeneous wired-wireless network

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are one of the prominent network
  security attacks. In DDoS attack several machines send large amount of network traffic
  to the victim using spoofed IP address. Unfortunately there is no reliable technique
  to detect spoofed IP packets. In this paper we argue that, a proactive detection
  of spoofed IP packets will help in predicting DDoS attacks. In this paper we describe
  an event based detection method to identify spoofed IP packets. Our method works
  by proactively probing received packets for genuineness. Active probing technique
  uses inconsistencies in TTL values of received packets to decide whether the first
  packet was spoofed or genuine. We enumerate several possible spoofing scenarios
  with our detection method in place and identify its type based on the response to
  probing. Further, we study limitations of event based method and discuss ways to
  overcome those. We design and experiment with all spoofing scenarios in a real network
  setup and report the results. With few optimizations done to the probing strategy,
  the overhead incurred can be minimized considerably, which makes the proposed technique
  useful for detecting DDoS attacks.

GEOLOC: Chengdu, CN
ABS: The Internet topology at the autonomous system (AS) level is of great importance,
  and traceroute has been known to be a potential tool to obtain a complete AS topology.
  The original IP-to-AS mapping table maps the IP addresses in traceroute paths to
  their origin ASes, which may cause false AS links. The existing methods refine the
  original mapping table based on traceroute-BGP path pairs or alias resolution data.
  However, the information extracted from either of them is inaccurate and incomplete.
  In this paper, we present a two-type information fusion based method to refine the
  original mapping table. We extract four kinds of information from path pair and
  alias resolution data. Based on these information, we build a candidate AS set for
  each router. Then we choose the AS that is consistent with the existing information
  to be the owner AS of each router and map all of the IP addresses on the router
  to it. We validate the result with the ground truth from PeeringDB and Looking Glass
  severs. Compared with the existing methods, our method produces a more accurate
  mapping table. In addition, we discuss the coverage of our method and show that
  our method is convergent and more robust against the reduction of information or
  the increase of incorrect information.

ABS: Controlling the flow and routing of data is a fundamental problem in many distributed
  networks, including transportation systems, integrated circuits, and the Internet.
  In the brain, synaptic plasticity rules have been discovered that regulate network
  activity in response to environmental inputs, which enable circuits to be stable
  yet flexible. Here, we develop a new neuro-inspired model for network flow control
  that depends only on modifying edge weights in an activity-dependent manner. We
  show how two fundamental plasticity rules, long-term potentiation and long-term
  depression, can be cast as a distributed gradient descent algorithm for regulating
  traffic flow in engineered networks. We then characterize, both by simulation and
  analytically, how different forms of edge-weight-update rules affect network routing
  efficiency and robustness. We find a close correspondence between certain classes
  of synaptic weight update rules derived experimentally in the brain and rules commonly
  used in engineering, suggesting common principles to both.

ABS: As the Internet has grown to represent arguably the largest engineered system
  on earth, network researchers have shown increasing interest in measuring this large-scale
  networked system. In the process, structures such as the physical Internet or the
  many different (logical) overlay networks that this physical infrastructure enables
  (e.g., WWW, Twitter, Facebook) have been the focus of numerous studies. Many of
  these studies have been fueled by the ease of access to big data. Moreover, they
  benefited from advances in the study of complex networks where distributed systems
  are typically represented as graphs and analyzed by applying graph-theoretic methods
  and techniques. However, an important missing aspect in typical applications of
  complex network theory to the study of real-world distributed systems has been a
  general lack of attention to domain knowledge. On the one hand, missing or superficial
  domain knowledge can negatively affect the studies input; that is, limitations or
  idiosyncrasies of the measurement methods can render the resulting graphs difficult
  to interpret if not meaningless. On the other hand, lacking or insufficient domain
  knowledge can result in specious output; that is, popular graph abstractions of
  real-world systems are incapable of accounting for details that are important from
  an engineering perspective and key to studying the systems actual (as compared to
  perceived) performance and functionality. In this thesis, we take a closer look
  at measurement-based characterization of a few real-world, large-scale networked
  systems and focus on the role that domain knowledge plays in gaining a thorough
  understanding of these systems key properties and behavior. More specifically, we
  use domain knowledge to (i) design context-aware measurement strategies that capture
  the relevant information about the system of interest, (ii) analyze the captured
  view of the networked system, bearing in mind the abstraction imposed by the chosen
  graph representation, and (iii) scrutinize the results derived from the analysis
  of the graph-based representations by investigating the root causes underlying these
  findings. Our target systems include various OSNs and the structure of the physical
  interconnections in todays Internet. The main technical contribution of our work
  is twofold. First, we establish concrete connections between the amount and level
  of domain knowledge needed and the quality of the measurements collected from networked
  systems. Second, we also provide concrete evidence for the role that domain knowledge
  plays in the analysis of views inferred from measurements collected from large-scale
  networked systems.

GEOLOC: Kent, OH, US
ABS: Centrality indices are essential concepts in network analysis. Closeness centrality
  is the very popular and most widely used centrality in the analysis of real-world
  complex networks. Closeness of a vertex is the inverse of the average distance to
  each other vertex, it shows how important and influential the vertex is. In particular,
  the current best algorithm of selecting the k most central vertices in unweighted
  undirected graphs is based on the All-Pairs-Shortest-Path approach (in short, APSP).
  However, in practice finding the most k central vertices in a dataset is computationally
  intractable, even for sparse graphs, since it requires a quadratic running time
  in the worst case. Fortunately, in this problem we are not required to compute the
  exact closeness centrality for all vertices, to save time, we can cut computation
  after finding the k vertices with the most closeness value. Bergamini et al. proposed
  a new algorithm for computing top-k ranking in unweighted graphs. Their work is
  based on computing a lower bound on total distances of every vertex and stopping
  the search when k vertices already have lower total distances than the bounds computed
  for the other vertices. In Bergamini et al. algorithm, the tightness of the bounds
  dramatically influences the algorithm performance. In this work, first, we propose
  a new method of computing lower bounds on total distances of vertices to replace
  the method of computing lower bounds in Bergamini et al. algorithm. We achieve excellent
  improvements through replacing the method of computing lower bounds in Bergamini
  et al. algorithm by our method of computing lower bounds. In our experiments on
  real-world networks we show that our new method of computing bounds combined with
  top-k ranking algorithm of Bergamini et al. significantly improves computation of
  finding the k most closeness vertices over the APSP and Bergamini et al. algorithm.
  Second, our method of computing lower bounds can be used as an approximation algorithm
  for finding the median vertex in a graph; the median of a graph is a vertex with
  the highest closeness centrality. We validate our approximation algorithm experimentally
  on various datasets from different domains, such as biology, social networks, collaboration
  networks, etc.

  theoretical and practical aspects of prior work. First, it handles weighted updates
  in amortized constant time, a common requirement in practice. Second, it uses a

  work even for unweighted streams. We describe experiments confirming that our algorithms

  components. CeDAR works under limited availability of recovery resources and optimizes
  service recovery over time. We modified two existing approaches to the problem of
  network recovery to make them also able to exploit incremental knowledge of the
  failure extent. Through simulations we show that CeDAR outperforms the previous
  approaches in terms of recovery resource utilization and accumulative flow over

ABS: The zero-padding overhead created when performing Random Linear Network Coding
  (RLNC) on unequal-sized packets can curb its promising benefits since it can be
  as high as the data to convey. The concept of macro-symbol coding was introduced
  recently in order to reduce the zero-padding overhead that RLNC has brought. Macro-symbols
  are subsets of the packets, i.e. concatenated bytes. They allow performing coding
  mainly on the payload and they proved to be efficient against the naive padding.
  This paper studies the properties of macro-symbols and provides a characterization
  of their impact on the computational complexity as well as the overall overhead.
  Furthermore, we provide a theoretical framework for the encoding and decoding complexity
  for the state-of-the-art schemes for unequal-sized packets. Our simulations results
  performed on a series of benchmark video traces show that small macro-symbols guarantee
  a dramatic reduction of padding overhead, whilst it results on a higher decoding
  complexity on the other hand compared with RLNC in the worst case.

ABS: Forwarding fault detection increases the robustness of network connectivity by
  finding and allowing to react to faulty routers. One of the essential steps in forwarding
  fault detection is summarizing the observed traffic at different vantage points,
  so that the behavior of each monitored router can be assessed using a traffic validation
  function. This paper studies and characterizes 3 sketches (AGMS, Fast-AGMS and FastCount)
  as random variables in the given context. Sketches are traffic summary functions
  resilient to packet modification, creation and dropping that outperform sampling.
  By proposing a model for each sketch, we are able to define tighter bounds on the
  sketches precision. That means we can choose smaller sketches, around one order
  of magnitude or more for given requirements on the precision the sketch, typically
  in the range of tens of KB, saving memory and network bandwidth in the detection
  of faulty routers.

  For top-k identification, RAP exhibits memory savings by a factor of between 4 and
  64 depending on the workloads skewness. These empirical results are backed by formal
  analysis, indicating the asymptotic space improvement of our probabilistic admission
  approach. Additionally, we present d-Way RAP, a hardware friendly variant of RAP
  that empirically maintains its space and accuracy benefits.

ABS: Monitoring the traffic volumes of elephant flows, including the total byte count
  per flow, is a fundamental capability for online network measurements. We present
  an asymptotically optimal algorithm for solving this problem in terms of both space
  and time complexity. This improves on previous approaches, which can only count
  the number of packets in constant time. We evaluate our work on real packet traces,
  demonstrating an up to X2.5 speedup compared to the best alternative.

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a common type of Cybercrime. It can strongly
  damage a company reputation and increase its costs. Attackers improve continuously
  their strategies. They doubled the amount of unleashed communication requests in
  volume, size, and frequency in the last few years. This occurs against different
  hosts, causing resource exhaustion. Previous studies focused on detecting or mitigating
  ongoing DDoS attacks. Yet, addressing DDoS attacks when they are already in place
  may be too late. In this article, we consider network resilience by early prediction
  of attack trends. We show empirically the advantage of using non-parametric leading
  indicators for early prediction of volumetric DDoS attacks. We report promising
  results over a real dataset from CAIDA. Our results raise new questions and opportunities
  for further research in early predicting trends of DDoS attacks.

ABS: Botnets, as one of the most aggressive threats, has used different techniques,
  topologies, and communication protocols in different stages of their lifecycle since
  2003. Hence, identifying botnets has become very challenging specifically given
  that they can upgrade their methodology at any time. Various detection approaches
  have been proposed by the cyber-security researchers, focusing on different aspects
  of these threats. In this work, 5 different botnet detection approaches are investigated.
  These systems are selected based on the technique used and type of data used where
  2 are public rulebased systems (BotHunter and Snort) and the other 3 use machine
  learning algorithm with different feature extraction methods (packet payload based
  and traffic flow based). On the other hand, 4 of these systems are based on a priori
  knowledge while one is using minimum a priori information. The objective in this
  analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of these approaches under different scenarios
  (eg, multi-botnet and single-botnet classifications) as well as exploring how a
  system with minimum a priori information would perform. The goal is to investigate
  if a system with minimum a priori information could result in a competitive performance
  compared to systems using a priori knowledge. The evaluation is shown on 24 publicly
  available botnet data sets. Results indicate that a machine learningbased system
  with minimum a priori information not only achieves a very high performance but
  also generalizes much better than the other systems evaluated on a wide range of
  botnet structures (from centralized to decentralized botnets).

ABS: With more applications moving to the cloud, cloud providers need to diagnose
  performance problems in a timely manner. Offline processing of logs is slow and
  inefficient, and instrumenting the end-host network stack would violate the tenants
  rights to manage their own virtual machines (VMs). Instead, our system Dapper analyzes
  TCP performance in real time near the end-hosts (e.g., at the hypervisor, NIC, or
  top-of-rack switch). Dapper determines whether a connection is limited by the sender
  (e.g., a slow server competing for shared resources), the network (e.g., congestion),
  or the receiver (e.g., small receive buffer). Emerging edge devices now offer flexible
  packet processing at high speed on commodity hardware, making it possible to monitor
  TCP performance in the data plane, at line rate. We use P4 to prototype Dapper and
  evaluate our design on real and synthetic traffic. To reduce the data-plane state
  requirements, we perform lightweight detection for all connections, followed by
  heavier-weight diagnosis just for the troubled connections.

  about the general regional and network trends that underpin these manipulations.
  In this paper, we collect data on thousands of networks to understand how they intercept
  HTTP headers in-the-wild. Our analysis reveals that 25% of measured ASes modify
  HTTP headers. Beyond this, we witness distinct trends among different regions and
  AS types; e.g., we observe high numbers of cache headers in poorly connected regions.
  Finally, we perform an in-depth analysis of the types of manipulations and how they
  differ across regions.

ABS: Many networks are used to transfer information or goods, in other words, they
  are navigated. The larger the network, the more difficult it is to navigate efficiently.
  Indeed, information routing in the Internet faces serious scalability problems due
  to its rapid growth, recently accelerated by the rise of the Internet of Things.
  Large networks like the Internet can be navigated efficiently if nodes, or agents,
  actively forward information based on hidden maps underlying these systems. However,
  in reality most agents will deny to forward messages, which has a cost, and navigation
  is impossible. Can we design appropriate incentives that lead to participation and
  global navigability? Here, we present an evolutionary game where agents share the
  value generated by successful delivery of information or goods. We show that global
  navigability can emerge, but its complete breakdown is possible as well. Furthermore,
  we show that the system tends to self-organize into local clusters of agents who
  participate in the navigation. This organizational principle can be exploited to
  favor the emergence of global navigability in the system.

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service attacks are becoming a serious issue for the developers
  and the users of the Internet. In recent times, the attackers are targeting the
  online applications and web services. Detecting such application level attacks are
  much challenging because the attack traffic mimics the legitimate behaviour. A more
  sophisticated mechanism is required to detect and mitigate such attacks. In this
  paper, a novel method for detecting application layer Distributed Denial of Service
  attack is proposed. Initially, web user behaviour on different perspectives is analyzed
  using the system log and key dimensions that are highly responsive to attacks are
  identified using Principal Component Analysis. The extracted key features are analyzed
  to fix up the appropriate thresholds for differentiating legitimate and illegitimate
  access. Each incoming session is examined and if found suspicious, the detection
  mechanism is invoked. The detection mechanism includes a score assignment mechanism
  which assigns the threat score based on the history and statistical analysis of
  the current characteristics. The sessions having acceptable score are then scheduled
  to get service from the server. Remaining sessions are considered malicious and
  dropped. The real data sets are taken for the simulation and the results are exhibited
  to show the efficiency of the proposed detection method. The results show that the
  proposed technique performs effective detection of constant flooding and repeated
  shot attacks with low false positives and low false negatives

ABS: 'Software-Defined Internet eXchange Points (SDXes) are recently gaining momentum,
  with several SDXes now running in production. The deployment of multiple SDXes on
  the Internet raises the question of whether the interactions between these SDXes
  will cause correctness problems, since SDX policies can deflect traffic away from
  the default BGP route for a prefix, effectively breaking the congruence between
  the control plane and data plane. Although one deflection on a path will never cause
  loops to occur, combining multiple deflections at different SDXes can lead to persistent
  forwarding loops that the control plane never sees. In this paper, we introduce
  SIDR, a coordination framework that enables SDXes to verify the end-to-end correctness
  (i.e., loop freedom) of an SDX policy. The challenge behind SIDR is to strike a
  balance between privacy, scalability, and flexibility. SIDR addresses these challenges
  by: (i) not requiring SDXes to disclose the flow space their SDX policies act on,
  only the next-hop they deflect to; and (ii) minimizing the number of SDXes that
  must exchange state to detect correctness problems. SIDR manages to preserve the
  flexibility of SDX policies by activating the vast majority of the safe policies,
  the policies that do not create a loop. We implemented SIDR on the SDX platform
  and showed its practical effectiveness: SIDR can activate 91% of all safe policies
  while preserving privacy and scalability and can perform correctness checks in about
  one second.'

ABS: The Internet reserves numerous potential path diversity among densely connected
  autonomous systems (ASes). However, the Internet routing is controlled by Border
  Gateway Protocol (BGP), which has limitations in path diversity expression and cooperation
  between ASes. The emergence of software defined networking (SDN) scheme provides
  flexible control over networks. In this paper, we leverage the programmability of
  SDN, and propose a new routing control plane, named RCS. It can support flexible
  inter-domain forwarding control, and enable network functions chaining along inter-domain
  paths. In RCS, network functions are abstracted and disseminated between SDN ASes.
  Customer networks can set up desired routing paths for particular applications,
  such as multipath routing. RCS can be deployed incrementally to apply SDN on current
  inter-domain settings. In our experimental analysis based on BGP data, the provision
  of RCS control at only a few ASes can lead to much potential path diversity.

ABS: Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging architecture that is dynamic,
  manageable, cost-effective and adaptable, making it ideal for the high-bandwidth,
  dynamic nature of todays applications. Using SDN, networks can enable a variety
  of concurrent, dynamically instantiated measurement tasks, that provide fine-grain
  visibility into network traffic by configuring Ternary Content Address Memory (TCAM)
  counters in hardware switches. However, TCAM memory is limited, thus the accuracy
  of measurement tasks depends on the number of resources devoted to them on each
  switch. In this thesis, we propose a solution that improves Dynamic Resource Allocation
  for Software-defined Measurements (DREAM), a framework with an adaptive step size
  search that achieves a desired level of accuracy for measurement tasks. We have
  enabled prediction capabilities in the framework to generate better counters configurations
  using previous network traffic information. We implement four estimation techniques
  (EWMA-based Prediction, Polynomial Curve Fitting, KMeans++ Cluster and Pseudo Linear
  Extrapolation) that have been tested with simulations running three types of measurement
  tasks (heavy hitters, hierarchical heavy hitters and traffic change detection) that
  show the proposed techniques improve task accuracy and tasks concurrency in DREAM.
  Existing traffic measurements tools usually rely on some predetermined concept of
  flows to collect traffic statistics. Thus, they usually have issues in adapting
  to changes in traffic condition and present scalability issues with respect to the
  number of flows and the heterogeneity of the monitoring applications. We propose
  an integration of the Programmable MEasurements (ProgME) paradigm, which defines
  a novel approach to defined measurement tasks in a programmable way using the concept
  of flowsets, on top of the DREAM framework. This enables better scalability for
  measurement tasks that deal with large amounts of traffic flows on DREAM while reducing
  the required number of counters allocations for the tasks.

ABS: My research work of the current thesis focuses on the detection of single, multiple
  and all repeated patterns in sequences. Many algorithms exist for single pattern
  detection that take an input argument (i.e., pattern to be detected) and produce
  as outcome the position(s) where the pattern exists. However, to the best of my
  knowledge, there is nothing in literature related to all repeated patterns detection,
  i.e., the detection of every pattern that occurs at least twice in one or more sequences.
  This is a very important problem in science because the outcome can be used for
  various practical applications, e.g., forecasting purposes in weather analysis or
  finance by detecting patterns having periodicity. The main problem of detecting
  all repeated patterns is that all data structures used in computer science are incapable
  of scaling well for such purposes due to their space and time complexity. In order
  to analyze sequences of Megabytes the space capacity required to construct the data
  structure and execute the algorithm can be of Terabyte magnitude. In order to overcome
  such problems, my research has focused on simultaneous optimization of space and
  time complexity by introducing a new data structure (LERP-RSA) while the mathematical
  foundation that guarantees its correctness and validity has also been built and
  proved. A unique, innovative algorithm (ARPaD), which takes advantage of the exceptional
  characteristics of the introduced data structure and allows big data mining with
  space and time optimization, has also been created. Additionally, algorithms for
  single (SPaD) and multiple (MPaD) pattern detection have been created, based on
  the LERP-RSA, which outperform any other known algorithm for pattern detection in
  terms of efficiency and usage of minimal resources. The combination of the innovative
  data structure and algorithm permits the analysis of any sequence of enormous size,
  greater than a trillion characters, in realistic time using conventional hardware.
  Moreover, several methodologies and applications have been developed to provide
  solutions for many important problems in diverse scientific and commercial fields
  such as Finance, Event and Time Series, Bioinformatics, Marketing, Business, Clickstream
  Analysis, Data stream Analysis, Image Analysis, Network Security and Mathematics.

ABS: Tor is vulnerable to network-level adversaries who can observe both ends of the
  communication to deanonymize users. Recent work has shown that Tor is susceptible
  to the previously unknown active BGP routing attacks, called RAPTOR attacks, which
  expose Tor users to more network-level adversaries. In this paper, we aim to mitigate
  and detect such active routing attacks against Tor. First, we present a new measurement
  study on the resilience of the Tor network to active BGP prefix attacks. We show
  that ASes with high Tor bandwidth can be less resilient to attacks than other ASes.
  Second, we present a new Tor guard relay selection algorithm that incorporates resilience
  of relays into consideration to proactively mitigate such attacks. We show that
  the algorithm successfully improves the security for Tor clients by up to 36% on
  average (up to 166% for certain clients). Finally, we build a live BGP monitoring
  system that can detect routing anomalies on the Tor network in real time by performing
  an AS origin check and novel detection analytics. Our monitoring system successfully
  detects simulated attacks that are modeled after multiple known attack types as
  well as a real-world hijack attack (performed by us), while having low false positive
  rates.

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is an austere menace to network security.
  The in-time detection of DDoS attacks poses a stiff challenge to network security
  professionals. In this paper, the authors initiatively propose using a novel set
  of information theory metrics called I-Entropy and I-Divergence metrics for detecting
  DDoS attacks and flash events. The proposed metrics are highly sensitive towards
  detecting meek variations in the network traffic and elicit more information distance
  between legitimate and attack traffic flows as compared to existing predominantly
  used Generalized Entropy (GE) and Generalized Information Divergence (GID) metrics.
  As part of this work, a generalized detection algorithm has been proposed which
  uses the entropy difference between traffic flows to detect different types of DDoS
  attacks and FEs. The proposed detection algorithm has been validated using various
  publically available datasets of MIT Lincoln, CAIDA, FIFA and synthetically generated
  DDoSTB dataset in terms of various detection system evaluation parameters.

ABS: We make a case for packet-replay suppression at the network layer, a concept
  that has been generally neglected. Our contribution is twofold. First, we demonstrate
  a new attack, the router-reflection attack, that can be launched using compromised
  routers. In this attack, a compromised router degrades the connectivity of a remote
  Internet region just by replaying packets. The attack is feasible even if all packets
  are attributed to their sources, i.e., source authentication is in place, and our
  evaluation shows that the threat is pervasive---candidate routers for compromise
  are in the order of hundreds or thousands. Second, we design an in-network mechanism
  for replay suppression. We start by showing that designing such a mechanism poses
  unsolved challenges and simple adaptations of end-to-end solutions are not sufficient.
  Then, we devise, analyze, and implement a highly efficient protocol that suppresses
  replayed traffic at the network layer without global time synchronization. Our software-router
  prototype can saturate a 10 Gbps link using only two CPU cores for packet processing.

ABS: Identifying the heavy hitter flows or flows with large traffic volumes in the
  data plane is important for several applications e.g., flow-size aware routing,
  DoS detection, and traffic engineering. However, measurement in the data plane is
  constrained by the need for line-rate processing (at 10-100Gb/s) and limited memory
  in switching hardware. We propose HashPipe, a heavy hitter detection algorithm using
  emerging programmable data planes. HashPipe implements a pipeline of hash tables
  which retain counters for heavy flows while evicting lighter flows over time. We
  prototype HashPipe in P4 and evaluate it with packet traces from an ISP backbone
  link and a data center. On the ISP trace (which contains over 400,000 flows), we
  find that HashPipe identifies 95% of the 300 heaviest flows with less than 80KB
  of memory.

ABS: 'Objectives: This study proposes a model for generating synthetic network flows
  inserting malicious fragments randomly and a new metric for measuring the performance
  of an Anomaly Network Intrusion Detection System (ANIDS). Method: A simulation model
  is developed for generating synthetic network flows inserting malicious fragments
  that reflect Denial of Service (DoS) and Probe attacks. An ANIDS shall maximize
  true positives and true negatives which is equivalent to minimizing Type-I and Type-II
  errors. The geometric mean of True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR)
  is proposed as a metric, namely, Geometric Mean Accuracy Index (GMAI) for measuring
  the performance of any proposed ANIDS. Findings: The task of detecting anomalous
  network flows by inspecting at fragment level boils down to discrete binary classification
  problem. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve considers False Positive
  Rates (FPR) and True Positive Rate (TPR) only. It does not reflect the minimization
  of Type-I and Type-II errors. Maximizing GMAI is the reflection of minimizing 1-GMAI
  which is equivalent to minimizing Type-I and Type-II errors. Further, the GMAI can
  be employed as service level for evaluating acceptance sampling based ANIDS. The
  domain of DoS and Probe attacks, mostly employed by the intruders at fragment level
  is studied. A conceptual simulation model is developed for generating synthetic
  network flows incorporating malicious fragments randomly from the domain of DoS
  and Probe attacks. The conceptual model is translated into operational model (a
  set computer programs) and synthetic network flows are generated. Using the operational
  model, the 1000 synthetic network flows are generated for each percentage of anomalous
  flows varying from 0.1 to 0.9 and employing discrete uniform probability distribution
  for selecting a fragment for transforming it into malicious. The generated network
  flows for each percentage of anomalous flows are represented graphically as histogram.
  It is found that they follow discrete uniform distribution. Hence, the model is
  validated. Applications: The simulation model can be used for generating synthetic
  networks flows for evaluating ANIDS. The GMAI can be used as service level for evaluating
  a discrete binary classifier irrespective of domain.'

ABS: Network Function Virtualization aims at replacing specialized hardware network
  appliances by commodity servers. In this paper, we address sub-second variations
  in data center network workloads, which place highly volatile processing demands
  on the servers. This makes an efficient dimensioning of the hardware resources dedicated
  to network function execution challenging. Based on the observation that short-term
  peak workloads typically do not hit all machines at exactly the same time, we propose
  to enable the servers to reuse under-utilized resources of their peers by selectively
  redirecting packets when local resources are exhausted. To satisfy line rate performance
  demands, we present a hardware load management layer, which is located in the ingress
  path of each server. Our simulative evaluation shows that the load management layer
  can reduce the hardware resources required for network function execution by up
  to 24% while maintaining network throughput and latency performance. Especially
  in large data centers, these resource savings can significantly reduce network expenses.

ABS: The high number of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks has demanded
  innovative solutions to ensure the reliability and availability of internet services.
  In this sense, different methods have been used to analyze network traffic for denial
  of service attacks, such as neural networks, decision trees, principal component
  analysis and others. However, few explore dynamic features to classify network traffic,
  nor adaptive clustering. This dissertation proposes a new method, called TRAFFICbyAQR,
  which uses Recurrence Quantification Analysis based on the extraction of dynamic
  characteristics to express traffic behavior. The method is combined with the adaptive
  clustering algorithm (A-Kmeans) to classify attack traffic. The experiments were
  performed using the CAIDA, UCLA and CTU-13 databases and demonstrated the good accuracy
  of the method and the low number of false alarms.

ABS: The Thesis is devoted to create a new connection admission control (CAC) method
  capable of providing a differentiated service strategies, which would be suitable
  for modern high-speed networks, serving thousands of new connections per second.
  The developed AggSessAC method is based on short-term delay (of microsec-millisec
  range) of the decision-making process, in order to collect multiple connection initialization
  packets, thereby obtaining a new connection request set for further evaluation.
  Such access control method works as opposed to the traditional network resource
  allocation approach. A new connection request aggregation allows to bring the virtualization
  of parallel processing into connection admission management. In the Thesis a broad
  contemporary Internet traffic analysis is given, which is based on the thesis author
  and other researchers collected measurement results. A comprehensive analysis of
  Internet data flows from different perspectives - packets, flow and protocol - has
  allowed justifying the topicality of research and served as the basis for the development
  of new approach for admission management. For the verification and validation of
  the developed AggSessAC admission management solution, OMNeT++ discrete event simulation
  tool was used. During the development of this thesis, OMNeT++ environment INET framework
  was supplemented with AggSessAC functional unit (agent) which is able to collect
  a new connection requests and to realize priority-based admission management. The
  developed access control agent was added to INET framework available router software
  bringing the AggSessAC functionality, thereby allowing the solution experimental
  evaluation in OMNeT++ simulation environment. The obtained results show the efficiency
  of the AggSessAC method in comparison with the classic manner of the request processing,
  demonstrating the benefits of inter-evaluative and selective demand handling, which
  improves the management policy implementation. The research also includes estimation
  of AggSessAC method parameters and gives recommendations for their selection.

ABS: IP traceback plays an important role in cyber investigation processes, where
  the sources and the traversed paths of packets need to be identified. It has a wide
  range of applications, including network forensics, security auditing, network fault
  diagnosis, and performance testing. Despite a plethora of research on IP traceback,
  the Internet is yet to see a large-scale practical deployment of traceback. Some
  of the major challenges that still impede an Internet-scale traceback solution are,
  concern of disclosing Internet Service Provider (ISPs) internal network topologies
  (in other words, concern of privacy leak), poor incremental deployment, and lack
  of incentives for ISPs to provide traceback services. In this paper, we argue that
  cloud services offer better options for the practical deployment of an IP traceback
  system. We first present a novel cloud-based traceback architecture, which possesses
  several favorable properties encouraging ISPs to deploy traceback services on their
  networks. While this makes the traceback service more accessible, regulating access
  to traceback service in a cloud-based architecture becomes an important issue. Consequently,
  we address the access control problem in cloud-based traceback. Our design objective
  is to prevent illegitimate users from requesting traceback information for malicious
  intentions (such as ISPs topology discovery). To this end, we propose a temporal
  token-based authentication framework, called FACT, for authenticating traceback
  service queries. FACT embeds temporal access tokens in traffic flows, and then delivers
  them to end-hosts in an efficient manner. The proposed solution ensures that the
  entity requesting for traceback service is an actual recipient of the packets to
  be traced. Finally, we analyze and validate the proposed design using real-world
  Internet data sets

ABS: Both the number of hosts using Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), and the volume
  of IPv6 traffic, has increased exponentially since 2012.With this adoption, the
  IPv6 routed infrastructure becomes an increasingly important component of global
  critical infrastructure and network policy. Unfortunately, the tools and techniques
  used to perform active network topology discovery were designed for Internet Protocol
  version 4 (IPv4), leading to a potentially opaque view of the IPv6 Internet. In
  this thesis, we extend nascent work on stateless high-speed IPv4 active topology
  probing to develop a new IPv6 traceroute method Yelling At Random Routers Progressively
  version 6 (Yarrp6). Yarrp6 randomly permutes the set of IPv6 targets and hop counts
  to distribute load, thereby helping to avoid IPv6 response rate limiting. Further,
  we encode state in the IPv6 payload to permit Yarrp6 to both match responses with
  probes and use different probe transport protocols. Via active experimentation on
  the public IPv6 Internet, we compare the results obtained from Yarrp6 against the
  current state-of-the-art IPv6 topology mapping tool. We show that Yarrp6 can discover
  topology at more than an order of magnitude faster than previously possible. Finally,
  we conduct a study of the effect of transport layer protocol on forward Internet
  Protocol (IP) path inference to determine what protocol is best used for active
  IPv6 topology discovery.

ABS: 'Supporting the programming of stateful packet forwarding functions in hardware
  has recently attracted the interest of the research community. When designing such
  switching chips, the challenge is to guarantee the ability to program functions
  that can read and modify data planes state, while keeping line rate performance
  and state consistency. Current state-of-the-art designs are based on a very conservative
  all-or-nothing model: programmability is limited only to those functions that are
  guaranteed to sustain line rate, with any traffic workload. In effect, this limits
  the maximum time to execute state update operations. In this paper, we explore possible
  options to relax these constraints by using simulations on real traffic traces.
  We then propose a model in which functions can be executed in a larger but bounded
  time, while preventing data hazards with memory locking. We present results showing
  that such flexibility can be supported with little or no throughput degradation.'

ABS: This paper introduces a new single-pass reservoir weighted-sampling stream aggregation
  algorithm, Priority Sample and Hold. PRSH combines aspects of the well-known Sample
  and Hold algorithm with Priority Sampling. In particular, it achieves a reduced
  computational cost for rate adaptation in a fixed cache by using a single persistent
  random variable across the lifetime of each key in the cache. The basic approach
  can be supplemented with a Sample and Hold pre-sampling stage with a sampling rate
  adaptation controlled by PRSH. We prove that PRSH provides unbiased estimates of
  the true aggregates. We analyze the computational complexity of PRSH and its variants,
  and provide a detailed evaluation of its accuracy on synthetic and trace data. Weighted
  relative error is reduced by 40% to 65% at sampling rates of 5% to 17%, relative
  to Adaptive Sample and Hold; there is also substantial improvement for rank queries.

ABS: In this paper, an exact and proactive technique is created to distinguish Distributed

  measure abnormal traffic changes according to the phases of the attack. This traffic
  is then clustered by using a modified DBSCAN algorithm, and the centroids for the
  resulting clusters are then used as patterns for efficient distance-based classification
  to detect DDoS attacks. The experimental results showed that the classification
  based on DBSCAN centroids achieved accuracy of more than (98%). This system is characterized
  by processing and analyzing high-speed network traffic (by using entropy), discovering
  and accurately identifying types of DDoS attacks to reduce false alarms, and early
  detecting DDoS attacks in real time.

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a congestion-based attack that
  makes both the network and host-based resources unavailable for legitimate users,
  sending flooding attack packets to the victims resources. The non-existence of predefined

ABS: High-rate distributed denial of service (HDDoS) flooding attacks pose as a major
  threat to the Internet. Most present solutions based on machine learning approach
  are inept for detecting the attacks in real time due to high processing overhead.
  In this paper, we present a defense solution referred to as DyProSD that combines
  both the merits of feature-based and statistical approach to handle HDDoS flooding
  attacks. The statistical module marks the suspicious traffic and forwards to an
  ensemble of classifiers for ascertaining the traffic as malicious or normal. Our
  method filters the attack traffic protocol specifically by allocating various protocol
  specific filter engines dynamically. As and when DDoS attack occurs and the load
  of a filter engine reaches beyond its capable limit, a new filter engine is recruited
  dynamically from the idle resource pool for filtering, thus guaranteeing the quality
  of service for legitimate users concurrently. We establish the effectiveness of
  DyProSD through several experimental analysis and real-world dataset experiments
  and the results indicate enough confidence in favour of our solution.

ABS: Fixed and mobile network operators increasingly deploy managed content distribution
  networks (CDNs) with the objective of reducing the traffic on their transit links
  and to improve their customers quality of experience. As network operator managed
  CDNs (nCDNs) become commonplace, operators will likely provide common interfaces
  to interconnect their nCDNs for mutual benefit, as they do with peering today. In
  this paper, we consider the problem of using distributed algorithms for computing
  a cache allocation for nCDNs. We show that if every network operator aims to minimize
  its cost and bilateral payments are not allowed, then it may be impossible to compute
  a cache allocation. For the case when bilateral payments are possible, we propose
  two distributed algorithms, the aggregate value compensation and the object value
  compensation algorithms, which differ in terms of the level of parallelism they
  allow and in terms of the amount of information exchanged between nCDNs. We prove
  that the algorithms converge, and we propose a scheme to ensure ex-post individual
  rationality. Simulations performed on a real autonomous system-level network topology
  and synthetic topologies show that the algorithms have geometric rate of convergence,
  and scale well with the graphs density and the nCDN capacity.

  Overall, we find that 74% of IPv6 routes traverse at least one router that performs

  the most prevalent type of load balancing; surprisingly, we find a significantly
  higher prevalence of per-packet load balancing for IPv6 traffic than previously
  reported for IPv4. We investigate which header fields are used for load balancing,

ABS: In this article, we address the problem of scaling authentication for naming,

  policies and users sets of trust roots vary widely. The current mechanisms for authenticating
  names (DNSSEC), routes (BGPSEC), and EE certificates (TLS) do not support a coexistence
  of authentication policies, affect the entire Internet when compromised, cannot
  update trust root information efficiently, and do not provide users with the ability
  to make flexible trust decisions. We propose the Scalable Authentication Infrastructure
  for Next-generation Trust (SAINT), which partitions the Internet into groups with
  common, local trust roots and isolates the effects of a compromised trust root.
  SAINT requires groups with direct routing connections to cross-sign each other for
  authentication purposes, allowing diverse authentication policies while keeping
  all entities authentication information globally discoverable. SAINT makes trust
  root management a central part of the network architecture, enabling trust root
  updates within seconds and allowing users to make flexible trust decisions. SAINT
  operates without a significant performance penalty and can be deployed alongside
  existing infrastructures.

  selected monitors, i.e., preferential link tomography. Since assigning nodes as
  monitors usually requires non-negligible operational cost, we focus on assigning
  a minimum number of monitors to identify these interesting links. We propose an
  optimal monitor assignment (OMA) algorithm for preferential link tomography in communication
  networks. OMA first partitions the graph representing the network topology into
  multiple graph components. Then, OMA carefully assigns monitors inside each graph
  component and at the boundaries of multiple graph components. We theoretically prove
  the optimality of OMA by proving: 1) the monitors assigned by OMA are able to identify
  all interesting links and 2) the number of monitors assigned by OMA is minimal.
  We also implement OMA and evaluate it through extensive simulations based on both

  OMA reduces the number of monitors assigned significantly in various network settings.'

ABS: Traditional hardware-based firewall appliances are placed at fixed locations
  with fixed capacity. Such nature makes them difficult to protect todays prevailing
  virtualized environments. Two emerging networking paradigms, Network Function Virtualization
  (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN), offer the potential to address these
  limitations. NFV envisions to implement firewall function as software instance (a.k.a
  virtual firewall). Virtual firewalls provide great flexibility and elasticity, which
  are necessary to protect virtualized environments. In this paper, we propose to
  build an innovative virtual firewall controller, VFW Controller, to enable safe,
  efficient and cost-effective virtual firewall elasticity control. VFW Controller
  addresses four key challenges with respect to semantic consistency, correct flow
  update, buffer overflow avoidance, and optimal scaling in virtual firewall scaling.
  To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we implement the core components
  of VFW Controller on top of NFV and SDN environments. Our experimental results demonstrate
  that VFW Controller is efficient to provide safe elasticity control of virtual firewalls.

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks persist and are growing stronger.
  According to the latest data, 2016 has seen DDOS attacks which were large in both
  frequency and size \cite{arbor}. DDOS attacks have been investigated extensively
  and various countermeasures have been proposed to protect networks from these attacks.
  However, DDOS is still considered to be the major threat to current networks and
  there is a need for Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) to accurately detect DDOS attacks.
  Furthermore, network traffic now has significant Peer to Peer (P2P) traffic. P2P
  traffic in Europe accounts for more than a quarter of all bandwidth, and 40 percent
  of all packets sent. Previous work has shown that P2P traffic can have a negative
  impact on the accuracy of ADSs. A P2P traffic preprocessor was proposed in \cite{sardarali}
  to compensate for the adverse impact of P2P traffic on ADSs. In this project, two
  well-known anomaly detectors, namely Network Traffic Anomaly Detector (NETAD) and
  Maximum Entropy Anomaly Detector (MaxEnt), are evaluated with and without this P2P
  traffic preprocessor for the detection of DDOS attacks. Performance of these ADSs
  has also been evaluated for the detection of TCP and UDP flood Denial of Service
  (DOS) attacks. Results are presented which show that using this P2P traffic preprocessor
  improves the ability of these ADSs to detect attacks.

TITLE: Can SDN accelerate BGP convergence? A performance analysis of inter-domain
  routing centralization

GEOLOC: Forth, GR
ABS: The Internet is composed of Autonomous Systems (ASes) or domains, i.e., networks
  belonging to different administrative entities. Routing between domains/ASes is
  realised in a distributed way, over the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Despite its
  global adoption, BGP has several shortcomings, like slow convergence after routing
  changes, which can cause packet losses and interrupt communication even for several
  minutes. To accelerate convergence, inter-domain routing centralization approaches,
  based on Software Defined Networking (SDN), have been recently proposed. Initial
  studies show that these approaches can significantly improve performance and routing
  control over BGP. In this paper, we complement existing system-oriented works, by
  analytically studying the gains of inter-domain SDN. We propose a probabilistic
  framework to analyse the effects of centralization on the inter-domain routing performance.
  We derive bounds for the time needed to establish data plane connectivity between
  ASes after a routing change, as well as predictions for the control-plane convergence
  time. Our results provide useful insights (e.g., related to the penetration of SDN
  in the Internet) that can facilitate future research. We discuss applications of
  our results, and demonstrate the gains through simulations on the Internet AS-topology.

GEOLOC: Barcelona, ES
ABS: Obtaining flow-level measurements, similar to those provided by Netflow/IPFIX,
  with OpenFlow is challenging as it requires the installation of an entry per flow
  in the flow tables. This approach does not scale well with the number of concurrent
  flows in the traffic as the number of entries in the flow tables is limited and
  small. Flow monitoring rules may also interfere with forwarding or other rules already
  present in the switches, which are often defined at different granularities than
  the flow level. In this paper, we present a transparent and scalable flow-based
  monitoring solution that is fully compatible with current off-the-shelf OpenFlow
  switches. As in NetFlow/IPFIX, we aggregate packets into flows directly in the switches
  and asynchronously send traffic reports to an external collector. In order to reduce
  the overhead, we implement three different traffic sampling methods depending on
  the OpenFlow features available in the switch. We developed our complete flow monitoring
  solution within OpenDaylight and evaluated its accuracy in a testbed with Open vSwitch.
  Our experimental results using real-world traffic traces show that the proposed
  sampling methods are accurate and can effectively reduce the resource requirements
  of flow measurements in OpenFlow.

ABS: 'Researchers in many disciplines have previously used a variety of mathematical
  techniques for analyzing group interactions. Here we use a new metric for this purpose,
  called integrated information or phi. Phi was originally developed by neuroscientists
  as a measure of consciousness in brains, but it captures, in a single mathematical
  quantity, two properties that are important in many other kinds of groups as well:
  differentiated information and integration. Here we apply this metric to the activity
  of three types of groups that involve people and computers. First, we find that
  4-person work groups with higher measured phi perform a wide range of tasks more
  effectively, as measured by their collective intelligence. Next, we find that groups
  of Wikipedia editors with higher measured phi create higher quality articles. Last,
  we find that the measured phi of the collection of people and computers communicating
  on the Internet increased over a recent six-year period. Together, these results
  suggest that integrated information can be a useful way of characterizing a certain
  kind of interactional complexity that, at least sometimes, predicts group performance.
  In this sense, phi can be viewed as a potential metric of effective group collaboration.
  Since the metric was originally developed as a measure of consciousness, the results
  also raise intriguing questions about the conditions under which it might be useful
  to regard groups as having a kind of consciousness.'

ABS: Efficient algorithms and techniques to detect and identify large flows in a high
  throughput traffic stream in the SDN match-and-action model are presented. This
  is in contrast to previous work that either deviated from the match and action model
  by requiring additional switch level capabilities or did not exploit the SDN data
  plane. Our construction has two parts; (a) how to sample in an SDN match and action
  model, (b) how to detect large flows efficiently and in a scalable way, in the SDN
  model. Our large flow detection methods provide high accuracy and present a good
  and practical tradeoff between switch - controller traffic, and the number of entries
  required in the switch flow table. Based on different parameters, we differentiate
  between heavy flows, elephant flows and bulky flows and present efficient algorithms
  to detect flows of the different types. Additionally, as part of our heavy flow
  detection scheme, we present sampling methods to sample packets with arbitrary probability
  p per packet or per byte that traverses an SDN switch. Finally, we show how our
  algorithms can be adapted to a distributed monitoring SDN setting with multiple
  switches, and easily scale with the number of monitoring switches.

ABS: We consider the problem of estimating the latency of a feasible but unused Autonomous
  System-level path on the Internet. This problem arises in evaluating the overhead
  incurred by censorship and surveillance circumvention schemes that alter the Internet
  routing infrastructure, and the cost of attacks against such schemes. Since these
  paths are not advertised by the current routing infrastructure, they cannot be directly
  measured by end hosts, leading researchers to estimate the costs indirectly. Using
  traceroute measurements of observed Internet paths, we measure the accuracy of the
  two methods used in the literature to date, finding that these methods have poor
  accuracy and correlation, explaining as low as 3% of the variation in observed AS
  path latencies, and at most 42%. We also describe an improved method that can balance
  accuracy and path coverage. At the high end our estimator can explain up to 83%
  of variation in observed AS path latencies, while still being able to achieve 56%
  when maximizing the number of paths able to be estimated.

ABS: "Graphics processing units GPUs are a powerful platform for building the high-speed
  network traffic processing applications using low-cost hardware. The existing systems
  tap the massively parallel architecture of GPUs to speed up certain computationally
  intensive tasks, such as cryptographic operations and pattern matching. However,
  they still suffer from significant overheads due to critical-path operations that
  are still being carried out on the CPU, and redundant inter-device data transfers.
  In this paper, we present GASPP, a programmable network traffic processing framework
  tailored to modern graphics processors. GASPP integrates optimized GPU-based implementations
  of a broad range of operations commonly used in the network traffic processing applications,
  including the first purely GPU-based implementation of network flow tracking and
  TCP stream reassembly. GASPP also employs novel mechanisms for tackling the control
  flow irregularities across SIMT threads, and for sharing the memory context between
  the network interfaces and the GPU. Our evaluation shows that GASPP can achieve
  multigigabit traffic forwarding rates even for complex and computationally intensive
  network operations, such as stateful traffic classification, intrusion detection,
  and packet encryption. Especially when consolidating multiple network applications
  on the same system, GASPP achieves up to $16.2\times $ speedup compared with different
  monolithic GPU-based implementations of the same applications."

ABS: 'Software Defined Networking is an emerging architecture which focuses on the
  role of software to manage computer networks. Software Defined Networks (SDNs) introduce
  several mechanisms to detect specific types of attacks such as Denial of Service
  (DoS). Nevertheless, they are vulnerable to similar attacks that occur in traditional
  networks, such as the attacks that target control and data plane. Several techniques
  are proposed to handle the security vulnerabilities in SDNs. However, it is fairly
  challenging to create attack signatures, scenarios, or even intrusion detection
  rules that are applicable to dynamic environments such SDNs. This paper introduces
  a new approach to identify attacks on SDNs that uses: (1) similarity with existing
  attacks that target traditional networks, (2) an inference mechanism to avoid false
  positives and negatives during the prediction process, and (3) a packet aggregation
  technique which aims at creating attack signatures and use them to predict attacks
  on SDNs. We validated our approach on two datasets and showed that it yields promising

ABS: As Chronic Kidney Disease progresses slowly, early detection and effective treatment
  are the only cure to reduce the mortality rate. Machine learning techniques are
  gaining significance in medical diagnosis because of their classification ability
  with high accuracy rates. The accuracy of classification algorithms depend on the
  use of correct feature selection algorithms to reduce the dimension of datasets.
  In this study, Support Vector Machine classification algorithm was used to diagnose
  Chronic Kidney Disease. To diagnose the Chronic Kidney Disease, two essential types
  of feature selection methods namely, wrapper and filter approaches were chosen to
  reduce the dimension of Chronic Kidney Disease dataset. In wrapper approach, classifier
  subset evaluator with greedy stepwise search engine and wrapper subset evaluator
  with the Best First search engine were used. In filter approach, correlation feature
  selection subset evaluator with greedy stepwise search engine and filtered subset
  evaluator with the Best First search engine were used. The results showed that the
  Support Vector Machine classifier by using filtered subset evaluator with the Best
  First search engine feature selection method has higher accuracy rate (98.5%) in
  the diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease compared to other selected methods.

ABS: Millions of users world-wide are sharing content using Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks,
  such as Skype and Bit Torrent. While such new innovations undoubtedly bring benefits,
  there are nevertheless some associated threats. One of the main hazards is that
  P2P worms can penetrate the network, even from a single node and then spread rapidly.
  Understanding the propagation process of such worms has always been a challenge
  for researchers. Different techniques, such as simulations and analytical models,
  have been adopted in the literature. While simulations provide results for specific
  input parameter values, analytical models are rather more general and potentially
  cover the whole spectrum of given parameter values. Many attempts have been made
  to model the worm propagation process in P2P networks. However, the reported analytical
  models to-date have failed to cover the whole spectrum of all relevant parameters
  and have therefore resulted in high false-positives. This consequently affects the
  immunization and mitigation strategies that are adopted to cope with an outbreak
  of worms. The first key contribution of this thesis is the development of a susceptible,
  exposed, infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) analytical model for the worm propagation
  process in a P2P network, taking into account different factors such as the configuration
  diversity of nodes, user behaviour and the infection time-lag. These factors have
  not been considered in an integrated form previously and have been either ignored
  or partially addressed in state-of-the-art analytical models. Our proposed SEIR
  analytical model holistically integrates, for the first time, these key factors
  in order to capture a more realistic representation of the whole worm propagation
  process. The second key contribution is the extension of the proposed SEIR model
  to the mobile M-SEIR model by investigating and incorporating the role of node mobility,
  the size of the worm and the bandwidth of wireless links in the worm propagation
  process in mobile P2P networks. The model was designed to be flexible and applicable
  to both wired and wireless nodes. The third contribution is the exploitation of
  a promising modelling paradigm, Agent-based Modelling (ABM), in the P2P worm modelling
  context. Specifically, to exploit the synergies between ABM and P2P, an integrated
  ABM-Based worm propagation model has been built and trialled in this research for
  the first time. The introduced model combines the implementation of common, complex
  P2P protocols, such as Gnutella and GIA, along with the aforementioned analytical
  models. Moreover, a comparative evaluation between ABM and conventional modelling
  tools has been carried out, to demonstrate the key benefits of ease of real-time
  analysis and visualisation. As a fourth contribution, the research was further extended
  by utilizing the proposed SEIR model to examine and evaluate a real-world data set
  on one of the most recent worms, namely, the Conficker worm. Verification of the
  model was achieved using ABM and conventional tools and by then comparing the results
  on the same data set with those derived from developed benchmark models. Finally,
  the research concludes that the worm propagation process is to a great extent affected
  by different factors such as configuration diversity, user-behaviour, the infection
  time lag and the mobility of nodes. It was found that the infection propagation
  values derived from state-of-the-art mathematical models are hypothetical and do
  not actually reflect real-world values. In summary, our comparative research study
  has shown that infection propagation can be reduced due to the natural immunity
  against worms that can be provided by a holistic exploitation of the range of factors
  proposed in this work.

ABS: Several researchers during the last decade have encountered the problem of how
  to infer business relationships between autonomous systems ASes of the internet.
  Since the internet has a decentralised structure and public data sources containing
  inter-domain routing information have not been created for topology inference, there
  are no accurate and comprehensive maps of the internet readily accessible. This
  challenge has inspired several approaches for inferring business relationships between
  ASes from BGP routing data. This article presents one implementation of the most
  recent and most promising approach for relationship inference on AS-level. The algorithm
  used has been improved in terms performance and quality of the sanitising process.
  Unlike recent projects, not a only snapshot of the topology of the internet has
  been inferred but a comprehensive map showing the internet over the last decade.
  The correctness of this implementation and the inferred dataset is examined by comparison
  with a business relationship graph and a validation dataset provided by related
  work.

  In fact, DDoS can occur weekly or daily in a network but many organizations have
  no systems in place to monitor DDoS traffic so as to be aware if their networks
  are being attacked. Within that context, we propose to develop an architecture that
  enables a network a capacity of monitoring traffic on the fly and flexibly applying
  various detection and mitigation methods in order to reduce DDoS impact on the system
  shortly after it has happened. We also propose a SDN One-packet DDoS Mitigation
  (SODM) scheme with an Openflow switch functioning as a gateway to protect the inner
  server infrastructure. We also analyze Internet traffic to understand its common
  nature during attack and normal time. Knowledge of the traffic characteristics and
  the way to derive attack indicators are a critical input for the detection mechanism
  to work. The defense solution performance is evaluated to be able to cope with DDoS
  in small real time-scale with an acceptable false positive rate of ~ 6%.

ABS: 'This dissertation investigates the question: How do we precisely access and
  control time in a network of computer systems? Time is fundamental for network measurements.
  It is fundamental in measuring one-way delay and round trip times, which are important
  for network research, monitoring, and applications. Further, measuring such metrics
  requires precise timestamps, control of time gaps between messages and synchronized
  clocks. However, as the speed of computer networks increase and processing delays
  of network devices decrease, it is challenging to perform network measurements precisely.The
  key approach that this dissertation explores to controlling time and achieving precise
  network measurements is to use the physical layer of the network stack. It allows
  the exploitation of two observations: First, when two physical layers are connected
  via a cable, each physical layer always generates either data or special characters
  to maintain the link connectivity. Second, such continuous generation allows two
  physical layers to be synchronized for clock and bit recovery. As a result, the
  precision of timestamping can be improved by counting the number of special characters
  between messages in the physical layer. Further, the precision of pacing can be
  improved by controlling the number of special characters between messages in the
  physical layer. Moreover, the precision of synchronized clocks can be improved by
  running a protocol inside the physical layer by extending bit-level synchronization.
  Subsequently, we make three contributions embodied in the design, implePREVIEW mentation
  and evaluation of our approaches. First, we present how to improve the precision
  of timestamping and pacing via access to the physical layer at subnanosecond scale.
  SoNIC implements the physical layer in software and allows users to control and
  access every bit in the physical layer. Second, we demonstrate that precise timestamping
  and pacing can improve the performance of network applications with two examples:
  Covert timing channels and available bandwidth estimation. A covert timing channel,
  Chupja, is high-bandwidth and robust and can deliver hidden messages while avoiding
  detection. An available bandwidth estimation algorithm, MinProbe, can accurately
  estimate the available bandwidth in a high-speed network. Finally, we present how
  to improve the precision of synchronized clocks via access to the physical layer.
  DTP, Datacenter Time Protocol, extends the physical layers link-level synchronization
  and implements a peer-to-peer clock synchronization protocol with bounded nanosecond
  precision. Together, these systems and approaches represent important steps towards
  precise network measurements.'

ABS: Recently, different communities in computer science, telecommunication, and control
  systems have devoted a huge effort towards the design of energy efficient solutions
  for data transmission and network management. This paper collocates along this research
  line and presents a novel energy efficient strategy conceived for Ethernet networks.
  The proposed strategy, which exploits the opportunities offered by the IEEE 802.3az
  amendment to the Ethernet standard (known as energy efficient Ethernet) is based
  on the possibility of predicting the future traffic from the analysis of the current
  data flow. In agreement with the results of such a dynamic prediction, Ethernet
  links can be forced into a low power consumption state for variable intervals. Theoretical
  bounds are derived to detail how the performance figures depend on the parameters
  of the designed strategy and scale with respect to traffic load. Furthermore, simulation
  results carried out with both real and synthetic traffic traces are presented to
  prove the effectiveness of the strategy, which leads to considerable energy savings
  at the cost of only a limited bounded delay in data delivery.

ABS: Anecdotes, news reports, and policy briefings collectively suggest that Internet
  censorship practices are pervasive. The scale and diversity of Internet censorship
  practices makes it difficult to precisely monitor where, when, and how censorship
  occurs, as well as what is censored. The potential risks in performing the measurements
  make this problem even more challenging. As a result, many accounts of censorship
  beginaand endawith anecdotes or short-term studies from only a handful of vantage
  points. We seek to instead continuously monitor information about Internet reachability,
  to capture the onset or termination of censorship across regions and ISPs. To achieve
  this goal, we introduce Augur, a method and accompanying system that utilizes TCP/IP
  side channels to measure reachability between two Internet locations without directly
  controlling a measurement vantage point at either location. Using these side channels,
  coupled with techniques to ensure safety by not implicating individual users, we
  develop scalable, statistically robust methods to infer network-layer filtering,
  and implement a corresponding system capable of performing continuous monitoring
  of global censorship. We validate our measurements of Internet-wide disruption in
  nearly 180 countries over 17 days against sites known to be frequently blocked;
  we also identify the countries where connectivity disruption is most prevalent.

ABS: 'Network attacks and anomalies such as DDoS attacks, service outages, email spamming
  are happening everyday, causing various problems for users such as financial loss,
  inconvenience due to service unavailability, personal information leakage and so
  on. Different methods have been studied and developed to tackle these network attacks,
  and among them data streaming algorithms are quite powerful, useful and flexible
  schemes that have many applications in network attack detection and identification.
  Data streaming algorithms usually use limited space to store aggregated information
  and report certain properties of the traffic in short and constant time. There are
  several challenges for designing data streaming algorithms. Firstly, network traffic
  is usually distributed and monitored at different locations, and it is often desirable
  to aggregate the distributed monitoring information together to detect attacks which
  might be low-profile at a single location; thus data streaming algorithms have to
  support data merging without loss of information. Secondly, network traffic is usually
  in high-speed and large-volume; data streaming algorithms have to process data fast
  and smart to save space and time. Thirdly, sometimes only detection is not useful
  enough and identification of targets make more sense, in which case data streaming
  algorithms have to be concise and reversible. In this dissertation, we study three
  different types of data streaming algorithms: hot item identification, distinct
  element counting and superspreader identification. We propose new algorithms to
  solve these problems and evaluate them with both theoretical analysis and experiments
  to show their effectiveness and improvements upon previous methods.'

ABS: 'Per-flow cardinality measurement over big network data consisting of numerous
  flows is a fundamental problem with many practical applications. Traditionally the
  research on this problem focused on using a small amount of memory to estimate each
  flowas cardinality from a large range (up to 109). However, although the memory
  needed for each flow has been greatly compressed, when there is an extremely large
  number of flows, the overall memory demand can still be very high, exceeding the
  availability under some important scenarios, such as implementing online measurement
  modules in network processors using only on-chip cache memory. In this chapter,
  instead of allocating a separated data structure (called estimator) for each flow,
  we take a different path by viewing all the flows together as a whole: Each flow
  is allocated with a virtual estimator, and these virtual estimators share a common
  memory space. We show that sharing at the register (multi-bit) level is superior
  than sharing at the bit level. We present a framework of virtual estimators that
  allows us to apply the idea of sharing to an array of cardinality estimation solutions,
  achieving far better memory efficiency than the best existing work. Experimental
  results show that the new solution can work in a tight memory space of less than
  1 bit per flow or even one tenth of a bit per flowaa quest that has never been realized
  before.'

ABS: Flooding Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks could cause huge damages
  to Internet, which has much similarity with Flash Crowds (FC). Traditional Machine
  learning methods usually have a better performance for offline processing, however,
  they cannot process huge volume data which cannot be loaded in memory at one time
  and canat auto-update model in time. In this paper, a streaming detection mechanism
  based on Online Random Forest-Mondrian Forest is proposed to solve this problem.
  Firstly, a deep analysis has been done on clientas characteristics of DDoS and FC
  to find anomaly traffic behaviors in network layer. Based on the analysis, a new
  feature set has been concluded to describe the client behavior of DDoS and FC. Then
  a streaming detecting mechanism employed with online Random Forest based on the
  new feature set has been proposed. To evaluate this method, a comparison with the
  traditional offline batch process method-Random Forest has been done on two public
  real-world datasets. The results show that even though this method has a bit lower
  accuracy around 93% on Test Data, it can be trained like a streaming way which doesnat
  need load all data in memory at one time and can update itself automatically with
  time, which is more applicable for Big Data situations.

ABS: The robustness research of networked systems has drawn widespread attention in

  attacks through allocating appropriate defense resource to different nodes. In this
  paper, we apply a specific particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize
  the defense resource allocation in scale-free networks. Results reveal that PSO
  based resource allocation shows a higher robustness than other resource allocation
  strategies such as uniform, degree-proportional, and betweenness-proportional allocation
  strategies. Furthermore, we find that assigning less resource to middle-degree nodes
  under small-scale attack while more resource to low-degree nodes under large-scale
  attack is conductive to improving the network robustness. Our work provides an insight
  into the optimal defense resource allocation pattern in scale-free networks and
  is helpful for designing a more robust network.

ABS: 'Anycast is widely used in critical Internet infrastructures, including root
  DNS servers, to improve their scalability, resilience, and geographic proximity
  to clients. In practice, anycast depends on interdomain routing to direct clients
  to their aclosesta sites. As a result, anycastas performance is largely a result
  of available BGP routes. We provide what we believe to be the first longitudinal
  study of how anycast performs in providing load balancing and geographic proximity.
  We examine about 400M queries per day collected from over 100 anycast sites of the
  D root DNS server for over a year. From this data, we find evidence of excessively
  unbalanced load: several anycast sites absorb the majority of the total traffic.
  Moreover, we find that most of the clients do not use geographically proximal sites;
  queries on average travel twice the minimum distance. To investigate the root cause
  of these inefficiencies, we use more than 9,000 probes in RIPE Atlas to measure
  9 out of 13 DNS root servers. We show two main causes for poorly balanced load and
  long query distance: insufficient peering between the hosting domain and large ISPs,
  and misconfigured routes, often due to route leakages, from ISPs with poor peerings.'

ABS: 'The networking industry is facing enormous challenges of scaling devices to
  support the exponential growth of internet traffic as well as increasing number
  of features being implemented inside the network. Algorithmic hardware improvements
  to networking components have largely been neglected due to the ease of leveraging
  increased clock frequency and compute power and the risks of implementing complex
  hardware designs. As clock frequency slows its growth, algorithmic solutions become
  important to fill the gap between current generation capability and next generation
  requirements. This paper presents algorithmic solutions to networking problems in
  three domains: Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), firewall ruleset compression and non-cryptographic
  hashing. The improvements in DPI are twopronged: first in the area of application-level
  protocol field extraction, which allows security devices to precisely identify packet
  fields for targeted validity checks. By using counting automata, we achieve precise
  parsing of non-regular protocols with small, constant per-flow memory requirements,
  extracting at rates of up to 30 Gbps on real traffic in software while using only
  112 bytes of state per flow. The second DPI improvement is on the long standing
  regular expression matching problem, where we complete the HFA solution to the DFA
  state explosion problem with efficient construction algorithms and optimized memory
  layout for hardware or software implementation. These methods construct automata
  too complex to be constructed by previous methods in seconds, while being capable
  of 29 Gbps throughput with an ASIC implementation. Firewall ruleset compression
  enables more firewall entries to be stored in a fixed capacity pattern matching
  engine, and can also be used to reorganize a firewall specification for higher performance
  software matching. A novel recursive structure called TUF is given to unify the
  best known solutions to this problem and suggest future avenues of attack. These
  algorithms, with little tuning, achieve a 13.7% improvement in compression on large,
  real-life classifiers, and can achieve the same results as existing algorithms while
  running 20 times faster. Finally, non-cryptographic hash functions can be used for
  anything from hash tables to track network flows to packet sampling for traffic
  characterization. We give a novel approach to generating hardware hash functions
  in between the extremes of expensive cryptographic hash functions and low quality
  linear hash functions. To evaluate these mid-range hash functions properly, we develop
  new evaluation methods to better distinguish non-cryptographic hash function quality.
  The hash functions described in this paper achieve low-latency, wide hashing with
  good avalanche and universality properties at a much lower cost than existing solutions.'

ABS: Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are ever threatening to the developers
  and users of the Internet. DDoS attacks targeted at the application layer are especially
  difficult to be detected since they mimic the legitimate users requests. The situation
  becomes more serious when they occur during flash events. A more sophisticated algorithm
  is required to detect such attacks during a flash crowd. A few existing works make
  use of flow similarity for differentiating flash crowds and DDoS, but flow characteristics
  alone cannot be used for effective detection. In this paper, we propose a novel
  mechanism for discriminating DDoS and flash crowds based on the combination of the
  parameters reflecting their behavioral differences. Flow similarity, client legitimacy,
  and web page requested are identified as the principal parameters and are used together
  for effective discrimination. The proposed mechanism is implemented on resilient
  proxies in order to protect the server from direct flooding and to improve the overall
  performance. The real datasets are used for simulation, and the results are presented
  to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The results show that the proposed
  mechanism does effective detection with fewer false positives and false negatives.

ABS: Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks continue to constitute a pernicious
  threat to the delivery of services within the Internet domain. These attacks harness
  the power of thousands, and sometimes tens or hundreds of thousands of compromised
  computers to attack web-services and online trading sites, resulting in significant
  down-time and financial loss. The problem of detecting DDoS attacks is complicated
  by Flash Events (FEs), which share some characteristics with DDoS attacks, and which
  occur when a server experiences an unexpected surge in requests from legitimate
  clients. This paper presents the design and implementation of an ensemble-based
  DDoS attack detection and FE separation model, which combines two orthogonal anomaly-based
  attack detection strategies viz., network traffic analysis and server-load analysis.
  Using an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) technique, changes in individual
  network and server load metrics are first detected and then correlated to identify
  a variety of DDoS attacks, both at the network and the application layer, and to
  differentiate them from FE and normal traffic scenarios.

ABS: Managing data center networks is critical to keeping cloud services always available,
  fast and efficient. Today, network operators have limited tools that provide a delayed
  and inaccurate view and control for the network. This causes huge service delay
  and hours of service disruption before resolving a failure, which can cost millions
  of dollars. The key problem is that these tools are designed in a bottom-up fashion
  and are driven by device limitations instead of high-level goals. This keeps human
  operators always involved in device-level details such as the allocated resources
  for each management task at each device, which prevents detecting all events of
  interest and a fast reaction to network events. In this dissertation, we follow
  a top-down approach, where operators program a centralized controller based on high-level
  abstractions. Knowing what the operator wants, the controller uses algorithms to
  program switches and servers. These algorithms can quickly fine tune the switches
  and servers to keep high accuracy, react to events quickly, and leverage device
  optimizations and network knowledge to scale. In this dissertation, we developed
  four systems following the top-down approach that configure network monitoring and
  control resources at switches and servers.

ABS: Internet protocol (IP) spoofing is a serious problem on the Internet. It is an
  attractive technique for adversaries who wish to amplify their network attacks and
  retain anonymity. Many approaches have been proposed to prevent IP spoofing attacks;
  however, they do not address a significant deployment issue, i.e., filtering inefficiency
  caused by a lack of deployment incentives for adopters. To defeat attacks effectively,
  one mechanism must be widely deployed on the network; however, the majority of the
  anti-spoofing mechanisms are unsuitable to solve the deployment issue by themselves.
  Each mechanism can work separately; however, their defensive power is considerably
  weak when insufficiently deployed. If we coordinate partially deployed mechanisms
  such that they work together, they demonstrate considerably superior performance
  by creating a synergy effect that overcomes their limited deployment. Therefore,
  we propose a universal anti-spoofing (UAS) mechanism that incorporates existing
  mechanisms to thwart IP spoofing attacks. In the proposed mechanism, intermediate
  routers utilize any existing anti-spoofing mechanism that can ascertain if a packet
  is spoofed and records this decision in the packet header. The edge routers of a
  victim network can estimate the forgery of a packet based on this information sent
  by the upstream routers. The results of experiments conducted with real Internet
  topologies indicate that UAS reduces false alarms up to 84.5% compared to the case
  where each mechanism operates individually.

ABS: The Internet routing system faces serious scalability challenges due to the growing
  number of IP prefixes that needs to be propagated throughout the network. Although
  IP prefixes are assigned hierarchically and roughly align with geographic regions,
  todays Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and operational practices do not exploit opportunities
  to aggregate routing information. We present DRAGON, a distributed route-aggregation
  technique whereby nodes analyze BGP routes across different prefixes to determine
  which of them can be filtered while respecting the routing policies for forwarding
  data-packets. DRAGON works with BGP, can be deployed incrementally, and offers incentives
  for Autonomous Systems (ASs) to upgrade their router software. We illustrate the
  design of DRAGON through a number of examples, prove its properties while developing
  a theoretical model of route aggregation, and evaluate its performance. Our experiments
  with realistic AS-level topologies, assignments of IP prefixes, and routing policies
  show that DRAGON reduces the number of prefixes in each AS by at least 70% with
  minimal stretch in the lengths of AS-paths traversed by data packets.

ABS: A future content-centric Internet would likely consist of autonomous systems
  (ASes) just like todays Internet. It would thus be a network of interacting cache
  networks, each of them optimized for local performance. To understand the influence
  of interactions between autonomous cache networks, in this paper, we consider ASes
  that maintain peering agreements with each other for mutual benefit and engage in
  content-level peering to leverage each others cache contents. We propose a model
  of the interaction between the caches managed by peering ASes. We address whether
  stable and efficient content-level peering can be implemented without explicit coordination
  between the neighboring ASes. We show that content-level peering leads to stable
  cache configurations, both with and without coordination. However, peering Internet
  Service Providers (ISPs) that coordinate to avoid simultaneous updates converge
  to a stable configuration more efficiently. Furthermore, if the content popularity
  estimates are inaccurate, content-level peering is likely to lead to cost efficient
  cache allocations. We validate our analytical results using simulations on the measured
  peering topology of more than 600 ASes.

ABS: The Internet is facing the accelerating growth of routing table size. Backbone
  routers routing table has already reached 512k entries, which has a negative effect
  on the scalability of the Internet. Hierarchical addressing and locator/ID separation
  solutions have been proposed to address the scalability issue. However, there has
  been little focus on how to efficiently represent hierarchical location addresses
  for a large scale distributed network, such as todays Internet. In this paper, we
  present a variable-length address encoding method to represent hierarchical location
  addresses. Our analysis and evaluation results show that 1) it is difficult to use
  fixed-length encoding to represent hierarchical location addresses for a large scale
  network; and 2) the proposed variable-length addresses could guarantee the scalability
  property of hierarchical addressing, and alleviate the inefficiency of address space
  due to fixed-length addresses.

ABS: Graphs form a natural model for relationships and interactions between entities,
  for example, between people in social and cooperation networks, servers in computer
  networks,or tags and words in documents and tweets. But, which of these relationships
  or interactions are the most lasting ones? In this paper, given a set of graph snapshots,
  which may correspond to the state of a dynamic graph at different time instances,
  we look at the problem of identifying the set of nodes that are the most densely
  connected at all snapshots. We call this problem the Best Friends For Ever (Bff)
  problem. We provide definitions for density over multiple graph snapshots, that
  capture different semantics of connectedness over time, and we study the corresponding
  variants of the Bff problem. We then look at the On-Off Bff (O2Bff) problem that
  relaxes the requirement of nodes being connected in all snapshots, and asks for
  the densest set of nodes in at least k of a given set of graph snapshots. We show
  that this problem is NP-complete for all definitions of density, and we propose
  a set of efficient algorithms. Finally, we present experiments with synthetic and
  real datasets that show both the efficiency of our algorithms and the usefulness
  of the Bff and the O2Bff problems.

ABS: Measurement on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) system is important for understanding
  the Internet. Many attempts have been made to detect anomalous Internet events through
  dissecting BGP updates and tables. We notice that most works in this field either
  deploy/use few monitors or analyze aggregated statistics. Such practices may result
  in overestimating the impact of monitor-local events, which can be viewed by only
  a small area. We propose Large-scale BGP Event (LBE), which affects many IP prefixes
  (high impact) and is widely observable (non-local). To detect LBE, we propose the
  Update Visibility Matrix (UVM) to record the prefix and monitor related to each
  update. We formulate the problem of identifying LBE in UVM, which is NP-hard. Then
  we propose a heuristic algorithm to solve it. We apply the scheme to 2.18 TB of
  BGP updates and find that the identified LBEs are highly correlated with many well-known
  disruptive incidents. Besides, we identify 101 LBEs that have never been investigated
  before. By conducting case studies, we find that the LBEs have high impact and are
  caused by various reasons. Our work can assist in network/Internet management tasks
  such as problem prevention, diagnosis, and recovery.

ABS: We identify two vulnerabilities for existing highspeed network-layer anonymity
  protocols, such as LAP and Dovetail. First, the header formats of LAP and Dovetail
  leak path information, reducing the anonymity-set size when an adversary launches
  topological attacks. Second, ASes can launch session hijacking attacks to deanonymize
  destinations. HORNET addresses these problems but incurs additional bandwidth overhead
  and latency. In this paper, we propose PHI, a Path-HIdden lightweight anonymity
  protocol that solves both challenges while maintaining the same level of efficiency
  as LAP and Dovetail. We present an efficient packet header format that hides path
  information and a new back-off setup method that is compatible with current and
  future network architectures. Our experiments demonstrate that PHI expands anonymity
  sets of LAP and Dovetail by over 30x and reaches 120 Gbps forwarding speed on a
  commodity software router.

  a data set collected as flows based on which a clustered graph is resulted. These
  flows provide an aggregated view of the network traffic in which the exchanged packets
  in the network are considered so that more internally connected nodes would be clustered.
  We show that dictionary attacks could be detected through some parameters namely
  the number and the weight of clusters in time series and their evolution over the
  time. Additionally, the Markov model based on the average weight of clusters,will
  be also created. Finally, by means of our suggested model, we demonstrate that artificial
  clusters of the flows are created for normal and malicious traffic. The results
  of the proposed approach on CAIDA 2007 data set suggest a high accuracy for the
  model and, therefore, it provides a proper method for detecting the dictionary attack.

GEOLOC: Paris, FR
ABS: The Internet is composed of tens of thousands indepandant Autonomous Systems
  (ASes) owned and administred by organizations such as private corporations, Internet
  Service Providers (ISPs), universities, research labs, etc. These ASes exchange
  reachability information (i.e. IP prefixes) using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
  BGP was codified with realiability and scalability as the main design goals. Security
  elements were considered unnecessary and would have added a non-negligible overhead
  on BGP-enabled systems. Consequently, there is an implicit mutual trust among ASes
  because they are unable to verify the validity of the routes they receive from others.
  Prefix hijacking abuses this mutual trust in order to introduce fallacious routes
  in the Internet. This phenomenon can be accidental, i.e. resulting from a router
  misconfiguration. On the other hand, the phenomenon can also be the result of a
  deliberate against the global routing infrastructure, or a particular network. Such
  an attack can be used to blackhole the victim network, impersonate the victim, eavesdrop
  (including man-in-the-middle attacks), and other malicious activity (e.g. spam).
  Many proposals attempt to secure BGP by introducing cryptographic verification of
  the information transmitted to ASes. Unfortunately, they introduce an important
  overhead on BGP routers, and are therefore unlikely to be deployed in the short-to-mid
  term future. Consequently, a number of prefix hijacking detection techniques have
  also been proposed, which are deployable today. These detection techniques raise
  a rather large number of alerts, most of which are false positives resulting from
  benign routing practices. Consequently, the detection techniques are not suitable
  to study prefix hijacking because an external observer typically lacks the ground-truth
  needed in order to easily identify false positive alerts, and therefore has to manually
  inspect and investigate each alert. The main focus of this Dissertation is to seek
  the root cause of routing events (i.e. of prefix hijacking alerts) beyond reasonable
  doubts. In order to do so, we first, we reduce the global the number of raised alerts
  by analysing a large number of false positive alerts. From this analysis, we extract
  constructs that are composed of patterns and trends that reflect standard, but varied,
  routing practices. We then analyse the security threat associated with these constructs
  by considering their impact if they were used in prefix hijacking scenaros. Second,
  we circumvent the lack of groundtruth by analysing suspicious events from as many
  facets as possible. We achieve this by using a variety of auxiliary datasets that
  provide additional information about the involved networks, such as registration
  information, known malicious activity, and application-level activity. Specifically,
  we investigate three distinct prefix hijacking scenarios. First, we look at Multiple
  Origin AS (MOAS) prefixes, i.e. prefixes that are simultaneously announced by multiple
  ASes. We introduce a taxonomy of MOAS prefixes, and we create a series of filters
  that automatically discard over 80% of false positive alerts. We also analyse a
  real-world case where a MOAS coincided with spam and web scam traffic. We show that
  the current approach of correlating routing events with malicious activity is insufficient
  to evidence harmful BGP hijacks, and illustrate that the groundtruth substitutes
  we use enable a better understanding of routing events. Then, we look at prefix
  overlaps, namely at more specific prefixes. We analyse the global BGP routing table
  and clarify the engineering practices behind the use of such announcements, and
  present a prototype that currently discards around 50% of false positive alerts.
  Finally, we explore the IP blackspace, which is composed of the IP space that is
  actively globally announced on the Internet, even though it has not been assigned
  for use. We study the routing-level characteristics of these networks and identify
  some benign reasons why these networks are announced on the Internet. We focus on
  the security threat associated with these networks by looking at their application-level
  footprint, identify live IP addresses, and uncover a large amount of spam and scam
  activities carried out from the blackspace.

  two groups, the first being based on frequency analysis and second method being
  based on the use of traffic matrices, with the later analysis method being further
  subdivided into groups based on the traffic mean, variance and covariance. The frequency
  analysis of origin (O), destination (D) and O-D Pair statistics exhibit heavy tailed
  behavior. Because the large number of IP addresses contained in the CAIDA Datasets,
  only the most predominate IP Addresses are used when estimating all three sub-divided
  groups of traffic matrices. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and related methods
  are applied to identify key features of each type of traffic matrix. A new system
  called Antraff has been developed to carry out all the analysis procedures

ABS: 'Many attacks originate from inside, and security problems within cloud-computing
  platforms are becoming more and more severe. Although many Intrusion Detection System

  high bandwidth within, and the lack of a single ingress point to deploy the IDS.
  This paper presents two ideas allowing traditional IDS to be adopted to the cloud
  environment: software-defined-networking (SDN) based packet collection and a hybrid
  sampling algorithm to significantly reduce workload on the IDS. We integrate our
  data collector in the Open vSwitch of every physical server, making packets capturing
  highly efficient. Our hybrid sampling algorithm combines both flow statistics and
  IDS feedback to intelligently choose which packets to sample. The sampling rate
  is determined by the current workload in the cloud, and thus minimizing the effects
  to normal workload. We evaluate our prototype CIDS on a 125-server production OpenStack
  cloud using real world attack traces, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.'

ABS: Evolving nature of network traffic challenges existing models to fit and predict
  its behavior. In particular, real traffic modeling requires more flexible design
  that can adapt to long-range and short-range dependent traffic with dynamic patterns.
  Unfortunately, existing models cannot handle such requirements because various traffic
  behaviors such as periodic and self-similar are not taken into account. In this
  paper, Gaussian process regression (GPR) is adapted for traffic modeling and prediction.
  The connection between self-similarity as a traffic characteristic and GPR parameters
  has been driven and exerted to build of a new Hurst estimation method based on machine
  learning techniques. This led to propose self-similar covariance functions for enhancing
  prediction accuracy of GPR. The proposed GPR model has been applied for Hurst estimation
  as well as for traffic prediction on real traffic traces at different time-scales.
  The experimental results show the employment of self-similar covariance functions
  increases generalization ability of GPR for traffic modeling and prediction.

ABS: 'The magnitude of data being stored and processed in the Cloud is quickly increasing
  due to advancements in areas that rely on cloud computing, e.g. Big Data, Internet
  of Things and mobile code offloading. Concurrently, cloud services are getting more
  global and geographically distributed. To handle such changes in its usage scenario,
  the Cloud needs to transform into a completely decentralized, federated and ubiquitous
  environment similar to the historical transformation of the Internet. Indeed, research
  ideas for the transformation has already started to emerge including but not limited
  to Cloud Federations, Multi-Clouds, Fog Computing, Edge Computing, Cloudlets, Nano
  data centers, etc. Standardization and resource management come up as the most significant
  issues for the realization of the distributed cloud paradigm. The focus in this
  thesis is the latter: efficient management of limited computing and network resources
  to adapt to the decentralization. Specifically, cloud services that consist of several
  virtual machines, dedicated network connections and databases are mapped to a multi-provider,
  geographically distributed and dynamic cloud infrastructure. The objective of the
  mapping is to improve quality of service in a cost-effective way. To that end; network
  latency and bandwidth as well as the cost of storage and computation are subjected
  to a multi-objective optimization. The first phase of the resource mapping optimization
  is the topology mapping. In this phase, the virtual machines and network connections
  (i.e. the virtual cluster) of the cloud service are mapped to the physical cloud
  infrastructure. The hypothesis is that mapping the virtual cluster to a group of
  data centers with a similar topology would be the optimal solution. Replication
  management is the second phase where the focus is on the data storage. Data objects
  that constitute the database are replicated and mapped to the storage as a service
  providers and end devices. The hypothesis for this phase is that an objective function
  adapted from the facility location problem optimizes the replica placement. Detailed
  experiments under real-world as well as synthetic workloads prove that the hypotheses

ABS: 'Shortest-path queries on weighted graphs are an essential operation in computer
  networks. The performance of such algorithms has become a critical challenge in
  emerging software-defined networks (SDN), since SDN controllers need to perform
  a shortest-path query for every flow. Unlike classic solutions (e.g., Dijkstras
  algorithm), high-performance shortest-path query algorithms include two stages:
  preprocessing and query answering. Despite the improved query answering time, existing
  two-stage algorithms are still extremely time-consuming in preprocessing large-scale
  graphs. In this paper, we propose an efficient shortest-path query algorithm, called
  BBQ, which reduces the running time of both stages via tree decomposition. BBQ constructs
  a distance oracle in a bottom-top-bottom manner, which significantly reduces preprocessing
  time over existing algorithms. In addition, BBQ can answer batch queries in bulk
  by traversing the decomposed tree instead of executing separate queries. Our experimental
  results show that BBQ outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by orders of magnitude
  for the running time of the preprocessing stage. Meanwhile, BBQ also offers remarkable
  acceleration for answering batches of queries. As a result, SDN controllers that
  use BBQ can sustain 1.1-27.9 times higher connection request rates.'

ABS: 'Quantifying growth model in large scale complex networks has been analyzed using
  various distributions. Networks which are of ample interest in current scenario
  tend to follow the exponential distribution in their degree characteristics. This
  preferential attachment model only reflected the growth mechanism of the system.
  Birth and death are two indistinguishable phenomena of nature, thus losses of links
  and nodes in a network are bound to affect the distribution. Whether it be social
  network or biological reactions or body growth or it be popularity of actor or popularity
  of music genre all goes through three phases of growth, saturation and finally tends
  to decay. In this paper, we study this effect and come up with a more general Gamma
  Distribution model for these systems. A truly astonishing characteristic of these
  systems is their non-autonomy. The degree distribution parameter shows time dependency
  and follows an inverted bathtub curve. Initially when the birth rate exceeds the
  death rate of links, the number of links increases, which lowers the number of hubs
  to number of links ratio. Thus, the distribution parameter (y for scale-free) increases.
  When both rates are same, flat portion of bathtub curve is obtained. Finally, when
  the death of links dominates, three possibilities are there: When the number of
  hubs remains almost unchanged, decreasing portion of inverted bathtub curve is observed.
  When hubs also start decaying, constant parameter value persists or creates spike
  in the curve on abrupt hub deaths. These sudden spikes can occur anytime during
  the life period of a network.'

ABS: Traceroute is the most widely used Internet path analysis tool today to study
  the topology of the Internet and to diagnose routing failures as well as poor performance
  events. A major limitation of traceroute when the destination is not controllable
  by the user is its inability to measure reverse paths, i.e., the path from any given
  destination back to the source. This is a major drawback for ISPs, who need to understand
  the performance of the Internet paths connecting popular services (e.g., YouTube
  and Facebook) to their customers. Even if public servers and distributed measurement
  platforms can provide partial reverse path visibility through ad-hoc measurements,
  there is still a need for a structured approach capable of analyzing the performance
  of Internet paths connecting any pair of nodes (servers, routers, hosts, etc.).
  While the problem of reverse traceroute has been addressed in the past, proposed
  techniques rely on IP address spoofing - which might lead to security concerns,
  and assume the availability of certain route-tracking options -, which might not
  be available. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate DisNETPerf, a new tool which
  provides exactly the same type of information as traceroute, but for paths connecting
  arbitrarily selected nodes. DisNETPerf works by firstly locating probes (i.e., measurement
  points) that are the closest to a given target node, using them to perform traceroute
  measurements from the target point-of-view to a given destination for path performance
  monitoring and troubleshooting purposes. We propose two techniques for probe location,
  and demonstrate that the reverse path (from server to users) can be measured with
  very high accuracy in certain scenarios. We also analyze relevant characteristics
  of Internet paths and distributed measurement platforms, which reinforce the applicability
  and relevance of DisNETPerf in current Internet.

ABS: Network prefix hijacking is still a serious threat in the Internet. Confirmed
  incidents in the recent past have shown that even small autonomous systems (ASs)
  are able to manipulate routing information with huge global impact. Even though
  countermeasures exist, they are not established at large scale yet. Monitoring of
  the actual routing state is the only mean to provide at least information about
  prefix hijacking events for single ASs. Given topology information the resilience
  of an AS against prefix hijacking attacks can be determined. This paper proposes
  an improved formula to calculate the resilience of an AS against prefix hijacking.
  Additionally, the role of internet exchange points (IXPs) and the peering opportunities
  they provide are evaluated. Such opportunities allow for establishing links between
  ASs at very low cost. Current peering opportunities are derived from a collection
  of member data gathered from European IXPs. Furthermore, the effect of additional
  links on an ASs resilience is investigated by combining actual peering and individual
  peering opportunities.

ABS: The Internet has evolved from a small research network towards a large globally
  interconnected network. The deregulation of the Internet attracted commercial entities
  to provide various network and application services for profit. While Internet Service
  Providers (ISPs) offer network connectivity services, Content Service Providers
  (CSPs) offer online contents and application services. Further, the ISPs that provide
  transit services to other ISPs and CSPs are known as transit ISPs. The ISPs that
  provide Internet connections to end users are known as access ISPs. Though without
  a central regulatory body for governing, the Internet is growing through complex
  economic cooperation between service providers that also compete with each other
  for revenues. Currently, CSPs derive high revenues from online advertising that
  increase with content popularity. On other hand, ISPs face low transit revenues,
  caused by persistent declines in per-unit traffic prices, and rising network costs
  fueled by increasing traffic volumes. In this thesis, we analyze various approaches
  by ISPs for sustaining their network infrastructures by earning extra revenues.
  First, we study the economics of traffic attraction by ISPs to boost transit revenues.
  This study demonstrates that traffic attraction and reaction to it redistribute
  traffic on links between Autonomous Systems (ASes) and create camps of winning,
  losing and neutral ASes with respect to changes in transit payments. Despite various
  countermeasures by losing ASes, the traffic attraction remains effective unless
  ASes from the winning camp cooperate with the losing ASes. While our study shows
  that traffic attraction has a solid potential to increase revenues for transit ISPs,
  this source of revenues might have negative reputation and legal consequences for
  the ISPs. Next, we look at hosting as an alternative source of revenues and examine
  hosting of online contents by transit ISPs. Using real Internet-scale measurements,
  this work reports a pervasive trend of content hosting throughout the transit hierarchy,
  validating the hosting as a prominent source of revenues for transit ISPs. In our
  final work, we consider a model where access ISPs derive extra revenues from online
  advertisements (ads). Our analysis demonstrates that the ad-based revenue model
  opens a significant revenue potential for access ISPs, suggesting its economic viability.

ABS: Efficient retrieval of traffic archival data is a must-have technique to detect
  network attacks, such as APT(advanced persistent threat) attack. In order to take
  insight from Internet traffic, the bitmap index is increasingly used for efficiently
  querying over large datasets. However, a raw bitmap index leads to high space consumption
  and overhead on loading indexes. Various bitmap index compression algorithms are
  proposed to save storage while improving query efficiency. This paper proposes a
  new bitmap index compression algorithm called BAH (Byte Aligned Hybrid compression
  coding). An acceleration algorithm using SIMD is designed to increase the efficiency
  of AND operation over multiple compressed bitmaps. In all, BAH has a better compression
  ratio and faster intersection querying speed compared with several previous works
  such as WAH, PLWAH, COMPAX, Roaring etc. The theoretical analysis shows that the
  space required by BAH is no larger than 1.6 times the information entropy of the
  bitmap with density larger than 0.2%. In the experiments, BAH saves about 65% space
  and 60% space compared with WAH on two datasets. The experiments also demonstrate
  the query efficiency of BAH with the application in Internet Traffic and Web pages.

ABS: 'Network management and anomaly detection are challenges in high-speed networks
  due to the high volume of packets that has to be analysed. Flow-based analysis is
  a scalable method which reduces the high volume of network traffic by dividing it
  into flows. As sampling methods are extensively used in flow generators such as
  NetFlow, the impact of sampling on the performance of flow-based analysis needs
  to be investigated. Monitoring using sampled traffic is a well-studied research
  area, however, the impact of sampling on flow-based anomaly detection is a poorly
  researched area. This paper investigates flow sampling methods and shows that these
  methods have negative impact on flow-based anomaly detection. Therefore, we propose
  an efficient probabilistic flow sampling method that can preserve flow traffic distribution.
  The proposed sampling method takes into account two flow features: Destination IP
  address and octet. The destination IP addresses are sampled based on the number
  of received bytes. Our method provides efficient sampled traffic which has the required
  traffic features for both flow-based anomaly detection and monitoring. The proposed
  sampling method is evaluated using a number of generated flow-based datasets. The
  results show improvement in preserved malicious flows.'

ABS: Software-defined networking (SDN) promises flexible control of computer networks
  by orchestrating switches in the network dataplane through a centralized controller.
  However, despite this promise, operators used to fast and fault-tolerant routing
  using traditional protocols face three important problems while deploying SDN. One,
  the control plane timescales are too slow to enforce effective load balancing in
  order to efficiently use the available network capacity. Second, the commodity SDN
  switches have limited memory to enforce fine-grained policy rules which undermines
  the promise of flexible control. Third, the centralized controller itself is a single
  point of failure, which is unacceptable for operators used to running distributed
  fault-tolerant network protocols. This thesis aims to mitigate these problems using
  novel algorithms that exploit advanced data plane capabilities and enhancements
  to the control plane software. At the same time, we also provide simple abstractions
  on top of these systems so that network operators writing control programs need
  not worry about low-level details of the underlying implementation mechanisms.

ABS: 'The act of communication on the Internet inevitably leaks information. In particular,
  network headers reveal information (e.g., source address, flow information); yet,
  protecting the header has proven challenging. Past research successfully protected
  certain fields of the headers (e.g., source address), but no proposal has attempted
  to eliminate flow information from the header so that packets cannot be linked to
  flows; flow information is systematically used to subvert privacy. Hence, we investigate
  the following questions: Can we design an architecture that eliminates flow-packet
  linkability? Can we do so without imposing impractical requirements on the network
  infrastructure? Our proposed architecture is based on per-packet One Time Address
  (OTA)-an address that a host uses to send or receive exactly one packet. Furthermore,
  the architecture eliminates any implicit (e.g., the standard five-tuple in TCP/UDP
  packets) or explicit (e.g., flow identifier) flow information from packet headers.
  Yet, the architecture allows the communicating hosts to demultiplex seemingly unrelated
  packets to flows. We have implemented the proposed architecture, and our evaluation
  shows that it can satisfy todays packet forwarding requirements.'

ABS: Diagnosing performance problems in networks is important, for example to determine
  where packets experience high latency or loss. However, existing performance diagnoses
  are constrained by limited switch mechanisms for measurement. Alternatively, operators
  use endpoint information indirectly to infer root causes for problematic latency
  or drops. Instead of designing piecemeal solutions to work around such switch restrictions,
  we believe that the right approach is to co-design language abstractions and switch
  hardware primitives for network performance measurement. This approach provides
  confidence that the switch primitives are sufficiently general, i.e., they can support
  a variety of existing and unanticipated use cases. We present a declarative query
  language that allows operators to ask a diverse set of network performance questions.
  We show that these queries can be implemented efficiently in switch hardware using
  a novel programmable key-value store primitive. Our preliminary evaluations show
  that our hardware design is feasible at modest chip area overhead relative to existing
  switching chips.

  AF-Stream, a distributed stream processing system that addresses the trade-off between

  approximate fault tolerance, whose idea is to mitigate backup overhead by adaptively
  issuing backups, while ensuring that the errors upon failures are bounded with theoretical
  guarantees. Our AF-Stream design provides an extensible programming model for incorporating
  general streaming algorithms, and also exports only few threshold parameters for
  configuring approximation fault tolerance. Experiments on Amazon EC2 show that AF-Stream
  maintains high performance (compared to no fault tolerance) and high accuracy after
  multiple failures (compared to no failures) under various streaming algorithms.

ABS: Detecting violations of application-level end-to-end connectivity on the Internet
  is of significant interest to researchers and end users; recent studies have revealed
  cases of HTTP ad injection and HTTPS man-in-the-middle attacks. Unfortunately, detecting
  such end-to-end violations at scale remains difficult, as it generally requires
  having the cooperation of many nodes spread across the globe. Most successful approaches
  have relied either on dedicated hardware, user-installed software, or privileged
  access to a popular web site. In this paper, we present an alternate approach for
  detecting end-to-end violations based on Luminati, a HTTP/S proxy service that routes
  traffic through millions of end hosts. We develop measurement techniques that allow
  Luminati to be used to detect end-to-end violations of DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS, and,
  in many cases, enable us to identify the culprit. We present results from over 1.2m
  nodes across 14k ASes in 172 countries, finding that up to 4.8% of nodes are subject
  to some type of end-to-end connectivity violation. Finally, we are able to use Luminati
  to identify and measure the incidence of content monitoring, where end-host software
  or ISP middleboxes record users HTTP requests and later re-download the content
  to third-party servers.

ABS: Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks have steadily gained in popularity
  over the last decade, their intensity ranging from mere nuisance to severe. The
  increased number of attacks, combined with the loss of revenue for the targets,
  has given rise to a market for DDoS Protection Service (DPS) providers, to whom
  victims can outsource the cleansing of their traffic by using traffic diversion.
  In this paper, we investigate the adoption of cloud-based DPSs worldwide. We focus
  on nine leading providers. Our outlook on adoption is made on the basis of active
  DNS measurements. We introduce a methodology that allows us, for a given domain
  name, to determine if traffic diversion to a DPS is in effect. It also allows us
  to distinguish various methods of traffic diversion and protection. For our analysis
  we use a long-term, large-scale data set that covers well over 50% of all names
  in the global domain namespace, in daily snapshots, over a period of 1.5 years.
  Our results show that DPS adoption has grown by 1.24x in our measurement period,
  a prominent trend compared to the overall expansion of the namespace. Our study
  also reveals that adoption is often lead by big players such as large Web hosters,
  which activate or deactivate DDoS protection for millions of domain names at once.

ABS: Mapping the Internet at scale is increasingly important to network security,
  failure diagnosis, and performance analysis, yet remains challenging. Accurately
  determining the interface addresses used for inter-AS links from traceroute traces
  can be hard because these interfaces are often assigned addresses from neighboring
  ASes. Identifying these interfaces can benefit Internet researchers and network
  diagnosticians by providing accurate IP-to-AS mappings where such mapping is most
  difficult -- at AS boundaries. We describe a new algorithm, Multipass Accurate Passive
  Inferences from Traceroute (MAP-IT), for inferring the exact interface addresses
  used for point-to-point inter-AS links, as well as the specific ASes involved. MAP-IT
  combines evidence of an AS switch from distinct traceroute traces; using traceroute
  data makes it portable across IP networks. Each pass leverages prior inferences
  to refine existing inferences and to discover additional inter-AS link interfaces.
  We test MAP-IT with interface-level ground truth information from Internet2, achieving
  100% precision. Using approximate ground truth from Level 3 and TeliaSonera yields
  95.0% precision. These results suggest that MAP-IT is sufficiently reliable for
  network diagnostics.

  and scale impediments: i) per-trace state maintenance; and ii) a low-degree of parallelism.
  Based on this observation, we develop Yarrp (Yelling at Random Routers Progressively),
  a new traceroute technique designed for high-rate, Internet-scale probing. Yarrp
  is stateless, reconstituting all necessary information from ICMP replies as they
  arrive asynchronously. To avoid overloading routers or links with probe traffic,
  Yarrp randomly permutes an input IP X TTL space. We run Yarrp at 100Kpps, a rate
  at which the paths to all IPv4 /24s can be mapped in approximately one hour from
  a single vantage point. We compare Yarrp against existing systems, and present examples
  of topological dynamics exposed via the high sampling rates Yarrp enables.'

ABS: Internet service discovery is an emerging topic to study the deployment of protocols.
  Towards this end, our community periodically scans the entire advertised IPv4 address
  space. In this paper, we question this principle. Being good Internet citizens means
  that we should limit scan traffic to what is necessary. We conducted a study of
  scan data, which shows that several prefixes do not accommodate any host of interest
  and the network topology is fairly stable. We argue that this allows us to collect
  representative data by scanning less. In our paper, we explore the idea to scan
  all prefixes once and then identify prefixes of interest for future scanning. Based
  on our analysis of the censys.io data set (4.1 TB data encompassing 28 full IPv4
  scans within 6 months) we found that we can reduce scan traffic between 25-90% and
  miss only 1-10% of the hosts, depending on desired trade-offs and protocols.

ABS: The routes used in the Internets interdomain routing system are a rich information
  source that could be exploited to answer a wide range of questions. However, analyzing
  routes is difficult, because the fundamental object of study is a set of paths.
  In this paper we present new analysis tools -- metrics and methods -- for analyzing
  AS paths, and apply them to study interdomain routing in the Internet over a recent
  13-year period. Our goal is to develop a quantitative understanding of changes in
  Internet routing at the micro level (of individual ASes) as well as at the macro
  level (of the set of all ASes). To that end we equip an existing metri (Routing
  State Distance) with a new set of tools for identifying and characterizing unusually-routed
  ASes. At the micro level, we use our tools to identify clusters of ASes that have
  the most unusual routing at each time (interestingly, such clusters often correspond
  to sets of jointly-owned ASes). We also show that analysis of individual ASes can
  expose busis and engineering strategies of the organizations owning the ASes. These
  strategies are often related to content delivery or service replication. At the
  macro level, we show that ASes with the most unusual routing define discernible
  and interpretable phases of the Internets evolution. Furthermore, we show that our
  tools can be used to provide a quantitative measure of the flattening of the Internet.

ABS: 'Among the scalability limits in the Internet routing ecosystem are the BGP routing
  table size and the rate of updates. In this paper, we focus on the former. The BGP
  routing table size has been growing superlinearly in the past decades. Although
  the address space allocation was structured with aggregation in mind, this capability
  is impaired due in part to the need for traffic engineering. One major impairment
  are delegated prefixes. Prefix delegations contribute 15% to the routing table size
  and they also involve 14% of the traffic. Moreover, they reflect the large complexity
  of BGP: Delegations are not only the results of providers delegating address space
  to their customers but also vice versa. Some delegations are due to load balancing
  and transitive business relationships, others due to operational practices within
  organizations. We analyze BGP data as well as large-scale traceroute data to understand
  how delegations affect path selection. Although the need for delegations is apparent,
  our work highlights that the fragmentation of address space is going to continue
  and renders the routing table more and more un-aggregatable.'

ABS: 'SSL and TLS are used to secure the most commonly used Internet protocols. As
  a result, the ecosystem of SSL certificates has been thoroughly studied, leading
  to a broad understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the certificates accepted
  by most web browsers. Prior work has naturally focused almost exclusively on valid
  certificates--those that standard browsers accept as well-formed and trusted--and
  has largely disregarded certificates that are otherwise invalid. Surprisingly, however,
  this leaves the majority of certificates unexamined: we find that, on average, 65%
  of SSL certificates advertised in each IPv4 scan that we examine are actually invalid.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that despite their invalidity, much can be understood
  from these certificates. Specifically, we show why the webs SSL ecosystem is populated
  by so many invalid certificates, where they originate from, and how they impact
  security. Using a dataset of over 80M certificates, we determine that most invalid
  certificates originate from a few types of end-user devices, and possess dramatically
  different properties than their valid counterparts. We find that many of these devices
  periodically reissue their (invalid) certificates, and develop new techniques that
  allow us to track these reissues across scans. We present evidence that this technique
  allows us to uniquely track over 6.7M devices. Taken together, our results open
  up a heretofore largely-ignored portion of the SSL ecosystem to further study.'

  server logs of a large commercial content delivery network (CDN) that serves close
  to 3 trillion HTTP requests on a daily basis. Across the whole of 2015, these logs
  recorded client activity involving 1.2 billion unique IPv4 addresses, the highest
  ever measured, in agreement with recent estimates. Monthly client IPv4 address counts
  showed constant growth for years prior, but since 2014, the IPv4 count has stagnated
  while IPv6 counts have grown. Thus, it seems we have entered an era marked by increased
  complexity, one in which the sole enumeration of active IPv4 addresses is of little
  use to characterize recent growth of the Internet as a whole. With this observation
  in mind, we consider new points of view in the study of global IPv4 address activity.
  Our analysis shows significant churn in active IPv4 addresses: the set of active
  IPv4 addresses varies by as much as 25% over the course of a year. Second, by looking
  across the active addresses in a prefix, we are able to identify and attribute activity
  patterns to networkm restructurings, user behaviors, and, in particular, various
  address assignment practices. Third, by combining spatio-temporal measures of address
  utilization with measures of traffic volume, and sampling-based estimates of relative

  empirical observation of under-utilization in some areas, and complete utilization,

GEOLOC: Haifa, IL
ABS: Real time detection of flow anomalies is a critical part of wide range of management
  and security applications in many Cloud and NFV systems. Solutions based on per-flow
  records have become impossible due to the increasing traffic volumes and the limited
  available resources such as TCAM entries and fast counters. In this paper we study
  a novel dynamic control mechanism that allows detecting flow anomalies using only
  a limited number of counters. Starting from the simple observation that it is impossible
  to guarantee instantaneous detection of flow anomalies with a limited amount of
  counters, we study the trade-off between the time required to detect the anomaly
  and the number of available counters. We implemented the scheme in an OpenFlow enabled
  switch, where the logic is implemented in the controller, and demonstrate that it
  can be used to detect a single flow anomaly within large real traffic volume. To
  further reduce the detection time, we also implemented the scheme logic inside the
  switch and used the controller only for configuration. This implementation indeed
  yielded a faster detection and lower monitoring communication overhead while not
  introducing any significant observable costs at the switch itself.

ABS: Cyber attacks have become a problem that is threatening the economy, human privacy,
  and even national security. Before we can adequately address the problem, we need
  to have a crystal clear understanding about cyber attacks from various perspectives.
  This is a challenge because the Internet is a large-scale complex system with humans
  in the loop. In this paper, we investigate a particular perspective of the problem,
  namely the extreme value phenomenon that is exhibited by cyber attack rates, which
  are the numbers of attacks against a system of interest per time unit. It is important
  to explore this perspective because understanding the statistical properties of
  extreme cyber attack rates will pave the way for cost-effective, if not optimal,
  allocation of resources in real-life cyber defense operations. Specifically, we
  propose modeling and predicting extreme cyber attack rates via marked point processes,
  while using the Value-at-Risk as a natural measure of intense cyber attacks. The
  point processes are then applied to analyze some real data sets. Our analysis shows
  that the point processes can describe and predict extreme cyber attack rates at
  a very satisfactory accuracy.

ABS: Internet-based computer information systems play critical roles in many aspects
  of the modern society. However, these systems are constantly under cyber attacks
  that can cause catastrophic consequences. In order to defend these systems effectively,
  it is necessary to measure and predict the effectiveness of cyber defense mechanisms.
  In this paper, we investigate how to measure and predict the effectiveness of an
  important cyber defense mechanism that is known as early-warning. This turns out
  to be a challenging problem because we must accommodate the dependence among certain
  4-dimensional time series. In the course of using a dataset to demonstrate the prediction
  methodology, we discover a new non-exchangeable and rotationally symmetric dependence
  structure, which may be of independent value. We propose a new vine copula model
  to accommodate the newly discovered dependence structure, and show that the new
  model can predict the effectiveness of early-warning more accurately than the others.
  We also discuss how to use the prediction methodology in practice.

  priority routing rules that optimally stabilize a network, while maximizing its

  following simple SDN principles. The proposed scheme requires minimal, infrequent
  interaction with a central controller, limiting its imposed workload. Furthermore,
  it respects the internal structure of the autonomous systems and their existing
  peering relations. In addition, it co-exists smoothly with underlying distance vector-based
  routing schemes. The proposed scheme combines simplicity with substantial gains
  in served transit traffic volume, as shown by simulations in realistic setups and
  proven via mathematical analysis.

  study of key sharing in todays web. We analyze the prevalence with which websites
  trust third-party hosting providers with their secret keys, as well as the impact

  Our results reveal that key sharing is extremely common, with a small handful of

  is achieved by improving the HEMST(Hierarchical Euclidean Minimun Spanning Tree)
  clustering algorithm. It performs a similarity matching process to find the sender
  of each cluster that is the controlled host in botnet. Experimental results show
  that the clustering correct rate can reach to 97% which demonstrates the effectiveness

ABS: Volumetric attacks, which overwhelm the bandwidth of a destination, are amongst
  the most common DDoS attacks today. One practical approach to addressing these attacks
  is to redirect all destination traffic (e.g., via DNS or BGP) to a third-party,
  DDoS-protection-as-a-service provider (e.g., CloudFlare) that is well provisioned
  and equipped with filtering mechanisms to remove attack traffic before passing the
  remaining benign traffic to the destination. An alternative approach is based on
  the concept of network capabilities, whereby source sending rates are determined
  by receiver consent, in the form of capabilities enforced by the network. While
  both third-party scrubbing services and network capabilities can be effective at
  reducing unwanted traffic at an overwhelmed destination, DDoS-protection-as-a-service
  solutions outsource all of the scheduling decisions (e.g., fairness, priority and
  attack identification) to the provider, while capability-based solutions require
  extensive modifications to existing infrastructure to operate. In this paper we
  introduce MiddlePolice, which seeks to marry the deployability of DDoS-protection-as-a-service
  solutions with the destination-based control of network capability systems. We show
  that by allowing feedback from the destination to the provider, MiddlePolice can
  effectively enforce destination-chosen policies, while requiring no deployment from
  unrelated parties.

ABS: Studies of inter-domain routing in the Internet have highlighted the complex
  and dynamic nature of connectivity changes that take place daily on a global scale.
  The ability to assess and identify normal, malicious, irregular and unexpected behaviors
  in routing update streams is important in daily network and security operations.
  In this paper we describe Bigfoot, a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) update visualization
  system that has been designed to highlight and assess a wide variety of behaviors
  in update streams. At the core of Bigfoot is the notion of visualizing the announcements
  of network prefixes via IP geolocation. We investigate different representations
  of polygons for network footprints and show how straightforward application of IP
  geolocation can lead to representations that are difficult to interpret. Bigfoot
  includes techniques to filter, organize, analyze and visualize BGP updates that
  enable characteristics and behaviors of interest to be identified effectively. To
  demonstrate Bigfoots capabilities, we consider 1.79B BGP updates collected over
  a period of one year and identify 139 candidate events in this data. We investigate
  a subset of these events in detail, along with ground truth from existing literature
  to show how network footprint visualizations can be used in operational deployments.

ABS: 'Decoy routing is a promising new approach for censorship circumvention that
  relies on traffic re-direction by volunteer autonomous systems. Decoy routing is
  subject to a fundamental censorship attack, called routing around decoy (RAD), in
  which the censors re-route their clients Internet traffic in order to evade decoy
  routing autonomous systems. Recently, there has been a heated debate in the community
  on the real-world feasibility of decoy routing in the presence of the RAD attack.
  Unfortunately, previous studies rely their analysis on heuristic-based mechanisms
  for decoy placement strategies as well as ad hoc strategies for the implementation
  of the RAD attack by the censors. In this paper, we perform the first systematic
  analysis of decoy routing in the presence of the RAD attack. We use game theory
  to model the interactions between decoy router deployers and the censors in various
  settings. Our game-theoretic analysis finds the optimal decoy placement strategies---as
  opposed to heuristic-based placements---in the presence of RAD censors who take
  their optimal censorship actions---as opposed to some ad hoc implementation of RAD.
  That is, we investigate the best decoy placement given the best RAD censorship.
  We consider two business models for the real-world deployment of decoy routers:
  a central deployment that resembles that of Tor and a distributed deployment where
  autonomous systems individually decide on decoy deployment based on their economic
  interests. Through extensive simulation of Internet routes, we derive the optimal
  strategies in the two models for various censoring countries and under different
  assumptions about the budget and preferences of the censors and decoy deployers.
  We believe that our study is a significant step forward in understanding the practicality
  of the decoy routing circumvention approach.'

ABS: The process of network evolution presents an interesting problem that describes
  shifts in the behavior of a network structure. Given the widespread use of computer
  networks creates a need to drill down and analyze the behavior at the various levels
  to get a tangible perspective on shifts that may take place in a computer network.
  However, with cyber attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated, one of the key
  challenges is knowing whether there is even an attack on the network in the first
  place. This is mainly due to the overwhelming size and dynamism of evolving network
  structures which poses a big data problem. This chapter discusses graph theory concepts
  to model network behavior and then utilizing analytics to understand the dynamics
  of the network. For example techniques such as graph sampling play an important
  role in identifying potential cyber threats that may not be detected on a larger
  scale. Additionally, determining micro and macro level characteristics that are
  associated to key network features such as node centrality, and fundamental network
  properties such as densification and diameter respectively are critical in characterizing
  network behavior overtime that may be the result of a cyber threat. Therefore, in
  order to define and understand the vulnerabilities associated to the network, one
  must have an understanding of the overall structure and nature of communication
  patterns within the network as well as the potential points of vulnerability.

  First, related work on Internet security is summarized at the beginning. Then, we
  propose an Anomaly Detection Response Mechanism (ADRM) based on mapping requests,
  which is featured by the pre-alarming, detection efficiency and traffic control.
  Next, we present a scalable and efficient identifier-separating mapping mechanism,
  which is used to efficiently detect DDoS attacks and prevent DDoS attackers from
  controlling the botnets.

ABS: A lot of research has been devoted to understanding the technical properties
  of amplification DDoS attacks and the emergence of the DDoS-as-a-service economy,
  especially the so-called booters. Much less is known about the consequences for
  victimization patterns. We profile victims via data from amplification DDoS honeypots.
  We develop victimization rates and present explanatory models capturing key determinants
  of these rates. Our analysis demonstrates that the bulk of the attacks are directed
  at users in access networks, not at hosting, and even less at enterprise networks.
  We find that victimization in broadband ISPs is highly proportional to the number
  of ISP subscribers and that certain countries have significantly higher or lower
  victim rates which are only partially explained by institutional factors such as
  ICT development. We also find that victimization rate in hosting networks is proportional
  to the number of hosted domains and number of routed IP addresses and that content
  popularity has a minor impact on victimization rates. Finally, we reflect on the
  implications of these findings for the wider trend of commoditization in cybercrime.

ABS: Notwithstanding the increased popularity of cloud computing, Distributed Denial
  of Service (DDoS) remains a threat to its adoption. In this paper, we propose the
  use of a change-point monitoring algorithm to detect DDoS flooding attacks against
  cloud services by examining the packet inter-arrival time (IAT). This method leverages
  on the fact that most DDoS attacks are automated and exhibit similar patterns. These
  patterns, when closely examined, can be distinguished from normal traffic patterns,
  and can therefore be tracked using a cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm. The proposed
  solution was validated by conducting a trace-driven simulation and empirical evaluation.
  The results demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of this proposed solution.

ABS: A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a major security threat for
  networks and Internet services. Attackers can generate attack traffic similar to
  normal network traffic using sophisticated attacking tools. In such a situation,
  many intrusion detection systems fail to identify DDoS attack in real time. However,
  DDoS attack traffic behaves differently from legitimate network traffic in terms
  of traffic features. Statistical properties of various features can be analyzed
  to distinguish the attack traffic from legitimate traffic. In this paper, we introduce
  a statistical measure called Feature Feature score for multivariate data analysis
  to distinguish DDoS attack traffic from normal traffic. We extract three basic parameters
  of network traffic, namely, entropy of source IPs, variation of source IPs, and
  packet rate to analyze the behavior of network traffic for attack detection. The
  method is validated using CAIDA DDoS 2007 and MIT DARPA datasets.

ABS: In the information age where Internet is the most important means of delivery
  of plethora of services, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have emerged
  as one of the most serious threat. Strategic, security, social, and financial implications
  of these attacks have ceaselessly alarmed the entire cyber community. To obviate
  a DDoS attack and mitigate its impact, there is an irrevocable prerequisite to accurately
  detect them promptly. An inherent challenge in addressing this issue is to efficiently
  distinguish these attacks from characteristically analogous flash events (FEs) which
  are bona fide occurrences generated by legitimate users. Most of the studies have
  focused on finding out the unique characteristics of DDoS attacks in isolation,
  with the peril of false alarms heuristically. To preclude this, it is pertinent
  to fundamentally focus on identifying the unique characteristics of FE vis-a-vis
  DDoS attacks ab initio which has been the basis of this work. The aim of this paper
  is to formulate the taxonomy of FEs and compare the characteristics of FEs and DDoS
  attacks to segregate these using several empirical metrics. Real and emulation datasets
  have been used to validate the characteristics of both. The extensive analysis in
  this study establishes that there are numerous technical dissimilarities that can
  be exploited to separate these similar looking events.

  means to find the shortest paths between ASes. A less significant drawback is restricting
  the shortest paths to only valley-free paths. Both approaches usually inflate the
  number of paths between ASes; introduce erroneous paths that do not conform to economic
  policies; and generate symmetric paths, which in reality is not a rule. As a result,
  the derived conclusions might be greatly misleading. In this study we introduce
  a single-destination, policy-preferred path enumeration algorithm which discovers
  policy consistent paths from all ASes to a destination AS in an AS-level Internet

ABS: The average path length of the Internet autonomous system (AS) level topology
  was decreasing slightly in the last decade. Researches had shown that the average
  AS path length of the Internet was about 3.9 hops until 2012. However this inference
  was based on BGP routing tables collected from some vantage points that cannot cover
  the whole Internet. Researchers had also developed different methods to infer AS
  paths of the Internet, the easiest method considered the shortest paths as AS paths,
  but the reality is the ASes have self-defined routing policies which lead to a longer
  path than the shortest path. Other methods improved the inference accuracy. But
  they were also time consuming and difficult to be used in large scale. To explore
  the average AS path length of the Internet, we developed a new method to infer AS
  paths in a comparatively complete AS level topology. The core of this method was
  a path decision algorithm that simulated the packet transiting process for each
  AS in the Internet. The inference paths generated from this method were called as
  decision paths. The experimental results indicated that the decision paths were
  close to the actual AS paths especially for the path length distribution. At last,
  we discussed the effect of the incompleteness of peering links in the topology and
  inferred the average AS path length of the whole Internet using decision paths.

ABS: 'Decoy Routing, the use of routers (rather than end hosts) as proxies, is a new
  direction in anti-censorship research. However, existing proposals require control
  of hundreds of Autonomous Systems (AS) to provide Decoy Routing to Internet users
  in a single censorious country (e.g. China). This is considered necessary, as the
  adversary - in this case the Chinese Government - has connections to many Autonomous
  Systems (ASes), and we want to make sure it cannot simply route around those ASes
  which have decoy routers. In this paper, we present a new approach to the question
  of placing decoy routers. In decoy routing, the router intercepts messages en route
  to an overt destination and proxies them to covert destinations. Instead of trying
  to capture flows from an entire country, as proposed, we stipulate that the overt
  destination be a well known site (such as Alexa top-100), and concentrate on the
  AS-level paths to these sites. We construct a map of the structure of the Internet,
  as a graph of such AS-level paths and present a new way to identify key points -
  those few ASes which appear on a large fraction of paths leading to these popular
  websites. Our method yields results an order of magnitude cheaper than earlier proposals,
  and needs to be run only once, rather than for each censorious country. (We also
  identify the key routers inside a few key ASes.) Our results indicate that decoy
  routing is much more powerful than previously believed: using our new approach to
  place decoy routers, we need very few (less than 0:1% of Internet AS) to force an
  adversary to route through them. However, while the number of key ASes is small,
  the number of key routers in these ASes may be quite large -- a new challenge for
  decoy routing.'

ABS: Internet in recent years has become a huge set of channels for content distribution.
  And this has highlighted limits and inefficiencies of the current protocol suite
  originally designed for host-to-host communication. This paper joins the research
  efforts addressed by the new Internet challenges by proposing LogNet, a conservative
  extension of the current TCP/IP hourglass Internet architecture, that provides a
  new network aware Content Discovery Service. Contents are referred via the new notion
  of HyperNames (HN), whose rich syntax allow to specify, hosts, pki, fingerprint
  and a large list of optional logical attributes (tags) attached to the content name,
  such as e.g. mutable vs. immutable contents, digital signatures, owner, availability,
  price, etc. Hypernames are in part human-readable and in part machine-readable and
  thus self-certifying. Publication and discovery of HN is achieved using the new
  service Content Name System (CNS) with related protocol, whose behavior and architecture
  is, partly, inspired to DNS, and whose routing logic uses the BGP inter domain routing
  information. Moreover, the CNS service is implemented via a distributed protocol
  organized throughout a set of communicating CNS servers. The core of CNS is the
  Hypername Lookup Algorithm (HLA) which tunes content discovery of being network
  aware, by taking advantage of the Autonomous System (AS) relationships. In particular,
  the HLA starts the content discovery process in the local AS (i.e., where the query
  starts), and in case of negative answer, propagate the query by accounting for the
  AS-to-AS relationships (i.e., peering-to-peering, provider-to-customer, customer-to-provider).
  After discovered, the contents are distributed with the classical distribution protocols.

ABS: IP address mutation is a proactive defense method that is used to reduce the
  risk of network attacks, especially to deal with the worm propagation attacks. However,
  previous work did not give much consideration to the negative effects that IP address
  mutation could bring to network performance. To be specific, there is a trade-off
  between network performance and security, which implies that when a security mechanism
  is reinforced, network performance would be impaired and vice versa. Therefore,
  in order to achieve the optimal balance between performance and security, an optimal
  solution should be provided. In this paper, we propose an adaptive IP mutation defense
  method which is based on temporal-dimension, to dynamically control the mutation
  interval according to real-time measurable metrics, assurance and avoidance. This
  method leverages a genetic algorithm to achieve the optimization of performance-security
  trade-off. We then evaluate our method in a simulated computer cluster environment,
  including 1024 hosts, and demonstrate that our method can successfully find the
  optimal solution according to the experimental results. For example, it can reduce
  the worm propagation significantly, while maintaining the network performance in
  a predefined level.

ABS: 'Botnets represent one of the more aggressive threats against cyber security
  and botnet traffic analysis is one of the main approaches to study and investigate
  such threats. Botnets employ different techniques (e.g. fluxing and encryption),
  topologies (e.g. centralized and de-centralized) and communication protocols (e.g.
  HTTP and DNS) in different stages of their lifecycle. Therefore, identifying the
  botnets has become very challenging given that they can upgrade their methodology
  automatically at any time for one reason or another. To this end, different approaches
  are proposed for botnet traffic analysis and detection based on various botnet behaviours
  and structures. Hence, the main focus of this thesis is to investigate various botnet
  detection approaches based on the technique used and the available data. Specifically,
  two main categories of solutions are explored: application data analysis-based solutions
  and network analysis-based solutions. In the application data analysis category,
  two different approaches are explored: one with a priori knowledge and the other
  one without any a priori knowledge. On the other hand, flow-based botnet detection
  approaches are explored in the network analysis-based category focused on using
  minimum a priori knowledge. In this case, various feature extraction methods, machine
  learning algorithms, protocol filtering, non-numeric feature representation, normal
  behaviour representation and time generalization issues are investigated. Finally,
  a flow-based early warning system is proposed. The effectiveness of the solutions
  is shown on several botnet data sets from IRC botnets to peer-to-peer botnets. Results
  indicate that the proposed solutions can detect botnet behaviour with good performances.
  Moreover, two botnet detection systems from the literature and two publicly available
  malicious behaviour detection systems are employed for further evaluation of the
  proposed early warning system. The results indicate that the proposed system outperformed
  these four systems. Last but not least, the proposed system is evaluated as well
  on botnets in cellular networks on an exploratory basis. It is shown that the proposed
  system demonstrates promising performance under such circumstances as well.'

  out the limitations in current intrusion detection systems or intrusion prevention
  systems (IDS/IPS), mostly caused by application-layer DDoS attacks. Within this
  context, the objective of the paper is to detect a DDoS attack using a multilayer
  perceptron (MLP) classification algorithm with genetic algorithm (GA) as learning
  algorithm. In this work, we analyzed the standard EPA-HTTP (environmental protection
  agency-hypertext transfer protocol) dataset and selected the parameters that will
  be used as input to the classifier model for differentiating the attack from normal
  profile. The parameters selected are the HTTP GET request count, entropy, and variance
  for every connection. The proposed model can provide a better accuracy of 98.31%,
  sensitivity of 0.9962, and specificity of 0.0561 when compared to other traditional

ABS: The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critically fundamental element in the internet
  technology as it translates domain names into corresponding IP addresses. The DNS
  queries and responses are UDP (User Datagram Protocol) based. DNS name servers are
  constantly facing threats of DNS amplification attacks. DNS amplification attack
  is one of the major Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, in DNS. The DNS
  amplification attack victimized huge business and financial companies and organizations
  by giving disturbance to the customers. In this paper, a mechanism is proposed to
  detect such attacks coming from the compromised machines. We analysed DNS traffic
  packet comparatively based on the Machine Learning Classification algorithms such
  as Decision Tree (TREE), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), NaA-ve Bayes (NB) and Support
  Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the DNS traffics into normal and abnormal. In this
  approach attribute selection algorithms such as Information Gain, Gain Ratio and
  Chi Square are used to achieve optimal feature subset. In the experimental result
  it shows that the Decision Tree achieved 99.3% accuracy. This model gives highest
  accuracy and performance as compared to other Machine Learning algorithms.

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack brings revenue loss, productivity
  loss, reputation damage, theft, etc. to huge banking and business firms. This leads
  to the necessity of a good DDoS prevention and detection techniques. The paper aims
  to provide a better solution to these problems using features analysis. The statistical
  characteristics or parameters of the incoming packets viz. MTI (mean time intervals),
  POIP (probability of occurrence of IP), TTL (time to live), ACK value, SYN value,
  time stamp field, differentiated service field and sequence number are analyzed.
  The incoming packets are classified into normal and attack packets by deploying
  NaA-ve Bayes classifier algorithm using the attack and normal profile from previously
  available datasets. Information gain algorithm is used to decrease the computation
  time, memory usage and increase efficiency of detection by reducing the number of
  parameters. The performance increases with more consistency after the application
  of information gain. The efficiencies of detection before and after the application
  of information gain are 98% and 99.5% respectively. The computation time is also
  reduced by 46.6%. In the paper, we use CAIDA 2008 and CAIDA anonymous trace 2015
  datasets for feature selection and classification.

ABS: This masters thesis shows a method for analyzing the resilience of the network
  infrastructure serving the Domain Name System (DNS) data of a top-level domain (TLD)
  at the autonomous system (AS) level. The provided concepts are illustrated at the
  example of the country-code top-level domain (ccTLD) of the Netherlands, .nl. The
  described approach analyzes the distribution of DNS data and its users over autonomous
  systems and maps the obtained results onto the global AS topology as inferred by
  another research project. Furthermore, it investigates the existence of bottlenecks
  in the availability of second level domain names from the viewpoint of the most
  important resolvers of the TLD zone in the case of extraordinary circumstances such
  as complete failure of certain autonomous systems or other parts of the DNS infrastructure.
  To show some concrete results, 60 different such failure scenarios are simulated
  and their impact on the availability of the .nl-zone investigated. This is done
  by analyzing the existence and length of shortest paths in the AS topology between
  DNS resolvers and authoritative name servers. In most of the cases the impact on
  the DNS is negligible or negative impact can easily be avoided by placing multiple
  name servers at different locations in the network topology. However, some bottlenecks
  in this topology are identified. Some of the observed phenomenons can be used directly
  by SIDN, the registry of .nl, to improve the performance of the .nl-zone and others
  can be exploited by registrars to improve the availability of their domains and
  the ones of their customers. Also owners of domain names could keep the results
  of this analysis in mind when choosing a registrar which is most of the times also
  the hosting provider of registered domain names. Of course, the shown methodology
  can also be extended and applied on other TLDs. This kind of work was, to the best
  of our knowledge, never done before and can be improved in many aspects, which were
  for various different reasons, including constraints on time, available data and
  computational power, outside the possibilities for this thesis. Therefore this thesis
  is mainly meant as a guideline on DNS resilience analysis on second-level domain
  names. As such it introduces the reader to the necessary concepts of the DNS and
  inter-autonomous system routing by means of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), shows
  important aspects to keep in mind during this kind of work and also suggests how
  to improve the described approach to get more accurate results in future research.
  Next to providing the necessary background considerations also software tools are
  developed and made publicly available in order to enable other researchers to easily
  reproduce and improve upon the performed study.

ABS: Recently, damage caused by DDoS attacks increases year by year. Along with the
  advancement of communication technology, this kind of attack also evolves and it
  has become more complicated and hard to detect using flash crowd agent, slow rate
  attack and also amplification attack that exploits a vulnerability in DNS server.
  Fast detection of the DDoS attack, quick response mechanisms and proper mitigation
  are a must for an organization. An investigation has been performed on DDoS attack
  and it analyzes the details of its phase using machine learning technique to classify
  the network status. In this paper, we propose a hybrid KNN-SVM method on classifying,
  detecting and predicting the DDoS attack. The simulation result showed that each
  phase of the attack scenario is partitioned well and we can detect precursors of
  DDoS attack as well as the attack itself.

ABS: After carefully considering the scalability problem in Tor and exhaustively evaluating
  related works on AS-level adversaries, the author proposes ASmoniTor, which is an
  autonomous system monitor for mitigating correlation attacks in the Tor network.
  In contrast to prior works, which often released offline packets, including the
  source code of a modified Tor client and a snapshot of the Internet topology, ASmoniTor
  is an online system that assists end users with mitigating the threat of AS-level
  adversaries in a near real-time fashion. For Tor clients proposed in previous works,
  users need to compile the source code on their machine and continually update the
  snapshot of the Internet topology in order to obtain accurate AS-path inferences.
  On the contrary, ASmoniTor is an online platform that can be utilized easily by
  not only technical users, but also by users without a technical background, because
  they only need to access it via Tor and input two parameters to execute an AS-aware
  path selection algorithm. With ASmoniTor, the author makes three key technical contributions
  to the research against AS-level adversaries in the Tor network. First, ASmoniTor
  does not require the users to initiate complicated source code compilations. Second,
  it helps to reduce errors in AS-path inferences by letting users input a set of
  suspected ASes obtained directly from their own traceroute measurements. Third,
  the Internet topology database at the back-end of ASmoniTor is periodically updated
  to assure near real-time AS-path inferences between Tor exit nodes and the most
  likely visited websites. Finally, in addition to its convenience, ASmoniTor gives
  users full control over the information they want to input, thus preserving their
  privacy.

GEOLOC: Beijing, CN
ABS: The correct functioning of inter-domain routing is of vital importance to the
  ever expanding Internet. As a common threat to the Internet, prefix hijackings often
  hijack traffic destined to some Autonomous Systems(ASes), leading to routing black
  holes or traffic interception. In this paper, we study two typical categories of
  prefix hijackings, namely false origin hijacking and man-in-the-middle interception,
  by extensive simulations. Our simulations are based on a new model which takes both
  the hierarchical Internet structure and the AS connectivity degrees into consideration.
  With this model, we explore the attacking/hijacking power of different ASes and
  their resisting power to this attack, where different categories of hijackings exhibit
  different characteristics. In addition, we also confirm that our results still hold
  considering various factors in the real Internet, including hidden links, prefix
  distribution, and RPKI, a countermeasure to prefix hijackings that is undergoing
  an active deployment in inter-domain routing. Some explanations and case studies
  are given to help better understanding of our results, which we hope will facilitate
  the deployment of RPKI and inspire new research.

GEOLOC: Wuhan, CN
ABS: To improve the hyperbolic mapping methods both in terms of accuracy and running
  time, a novel mapping method called Community and Hyperbolic Mapping (CHM) is proposed
  based on community information in this paper. Firstly, an index called Community
  Intimacy (CI) is presented to measure the adjacency relationship between the communities,
  based on which a community ordering algorithm is introduced. According to the proposed
  Community-Sector hypothesis, which supposes that most nodes of one community gather
  in a same sector in hyperbolic space, CHM maps the ordered communities into hyperbolic
  space, and then the angular coordinates of nodes are randomly initialized within
  the sector that they belong to. Therefore, all the network nodes are so far mapped
  to hyperbolic space, and then the initialized angular coordinates can be optimized
  by employing the information of all nodes, which can greatly improve the algorithm
  precision. By applying the proposed dual-layer angle sampling method in the optimization
  procedure, CHM reduces the time complexity to O(n2). The experiments show that our
  algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

  in DDoS amplification attacks. We monitored vulnerable systems for several weeks
  to determine their rate of remediation. By comparing with experimental controls,
  we analyze the impact of a number of variables: choice of party to contact (WHOIS
  abuse contacts versus national CERTs versus US-CERT), message verbosity, hosting
  an information website linked to in the message, and translating the message into
  the notified partys local language. We also assess the outcome of the emailing process
  itself (bounces, automated replies, human replies, silence) and characterize the
  sentiments and perspectives expressed in both the human replies and an optional
  anonymous survey that accompanied our notifications. We find that various notification
  regimens do result in different outcomes. The best observed process was directly
  notifying WHOIS contacts with detailed information in the message itself. These
  notifications had a statistically significant impact on improving remediation, and
  human replies were largely positive. However, the majority of notified contacts
  did not take action, and even when they did, remediation was often only partial.
  Repeat notifications did not further patching. These results are promising but ultimately
  modest, behooving the security community to more deeply investigate ways to improve
  the effectiveness of vulnerability notifications.'

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which are intended to make the
  service unavailable for legitimate users, originate in a highly distributed manner
  providing the illusion of legitimate traffic. The number of attacks and the volume
  of traffic associated with attacks continue to increase dramatically. At these traffic
  intensities, the network infrastructure upstream from the intended victim also becomes
  severely affected necessitating that attack traffic be filtered as close as possible
  to the attack sources. However, it is difficult to anticipate and identify such
  nodes as the attacks originate at widely distributed nodes and spread through various
  routes. To successfully respond by dropping traffic, the mitigating approach must
  identify routers on traffic paths with significant attack traffic and respond with
  minimum effect on legitimate traffic. We develop a suite of solutions to address
  this problem. Cooperative Defense Mechanism (CDM), a distributed responsive defense
  mechanism for DDoS attacks is presented. CDM allows the identification of network
  routers closer to the attack sources and provides these routers a profile that facilitates
  discrimination between legitimate and malicious packets during the attack and thus
  enables them to drop traffic perceived as malicious in a distributed manner.

ABS: Flow cardinality estimation is the problem of estimating the number of distinct
  elements in a data flow, often with a stringent memory constraint. It has wide applications
  in network traffic measurement and in database systems. The virtual LogLog algorithm
  proposed recently by Xiao, Chen, Chen and Ling estimates the cardinalities of a
  large number of flows with a compact memory. The purpose of this thesis is to explore
  two new perspectives on the estimation process of this algorithm. Firstly, we propose
  and investigate a family of estimators that generalizes the original vHLL estimator
  and evaluate the performance of the vHLL estimator compared to other estimators
  in this family. Secondly, we propose an alternative solution to the estimation problem
  by deriving a maximum-likelihood estimator. Empirical evidence from both perspectives
  suggests the near-optimality of the vHLL estimator for per-flow estimation, analogous
  to the near-optimality of the HLL estimator for single-flow estimation.

ABS: Network trace data provide valuable information which contributes to model the
  network behaviors, defend network attacks and develop new protocols, so releasing
  the data of network trace is highly demanded by researchers and organizations to
  promote the development of the network technologies. However, due to the sensitive
  nature of network trace data, it is a potential risk for organizations to publish
  the original data which may expose their commercial confidentiality and the customers
  privacy within their networks. Several methods to defend the network trace attacks
  such as statistical fingerprinting and injection have been proposed, unfortunately,
  they are not enough to protect the privacy because the correspondence between the
  source and destination IP addresses can also help the adversary to identify the
  target host. In this paper, we extract the inherent graph structure between the
  source and destination IP addresses in network trace data, and use k-anonymity to
  prevent the target host from being identified. Combined with other protection techniques,
  our method can also prevent the fingerprinting and injection attacks.

ABS: Energy efficient routers are important and promising devices in the roadmap toward
  green networking. In this paper, we explore this topic with a traffic aware design
  that can automatically adapt the routers energy consumption to the network traffic
  in real time with transitions at the scale from microseconds to nanoseconds. In
  this paper, we make three contributions. First, we propose an energy efficient router
  architecture using frequency scaling, which is extended from the contemporary line
  card architecture of the router. Second, we prototype our architecture on a gigabit
  NetFPGA platform, which extends a router design on that platform to dynamically
  work at six frequencies. Then, we discuss the implementation in detail and present
  a per-packet-based power consumption model from real-world measurements. Third,
  we further propose four algorithms, which efficiently and automatically adapt power
  grades under the methodology of periodical and threshold-based scaling. Our experiments
  are carried out on two platforms, a NetFPGA prototype for feasible scenarios and
  a simulator for other scenarios in excess of the NetFPGA port limit with parameters
  synthetically generated to the real-world measurement. Experimental results show
  that approximately 25% power can be saved with our architecture and algorithms.
  Conclusions are also given to summarize our findings.

ABS: Forwarding information base (FIB) scalability is a fundamental problem of numerous

  We propose Concise, a FIB design that uses very little memory to support fast query
  of a large number of location-independent names. Concise makes use of minimal perfect
  hashing and relies on the SDN framework and supports fast name classification. Our
  conceptual contribution of Concise is to optimize the memory efficiency and query
  speed in the data plane and move the relatively complex construction and update
  components to the resource-rich control plane. We implemented Concise on three platforms.
  Experimental results show that Concise uses significantly smaller memory to achieve
  faster query speed compared to existing FIBs for flat name switching.

  Furthermore, the proposed scheme has a smaller fan-out estimation error and consumes
  less memory than previously developed approaches. The hardware implementation can

ABS: 'Network management requires accurate estimates of metrics for traffic engineering
  (e.g., heavy hitters), anomaly detection (e.g., entropy of source addresses), and
  security (e.g., DDoS detection). Obtaining accurate estimates given router CPU and
  memory constraints is a challenging problem. Existing approaches fall in one of
  two undesirable extremes: (1) low fidelity general-purpose approaches such as sampling,
  or (2) high fidelity but complex algorithms customized to specific application-level
  metrics. Ideally, a solution should be both general (i.e., supports many applications)
  and provide accuracy comparable to custom algorithms. This paper presents UnivMon,
  a framework for flow monitoring which leverages recent theoretical advances and
  demonstrates that it is possible to achieve both generality and high accuracy. UnivMon
  uses an application-agnostic data plane monitoring primitive; different (and possibly
  unforeseen) estimation algorithms run in the control plane, and use the statistics
  from the data plane to compute application-level metrics. We present a proof-of-concept
  implementation of UnivMon using P4 and develop simple coordination techniques to
  provide a one-big-switch abstraction for network-wide monitoring. We evaluate the
  effectiveness of UnivMon using a range of trace-driven evaluations and show that
  it offers comparable (and sometimes better) accuracy relative to custom sketching

ABS: The convergent communication network will play an important role as a single
  platform to unify heterogeneous networks and integrate emerging technologies and
  existing legacy networks. Although there have been proposed many feasible solutions,
  they could not become convergent frameworks since they mainly focused on converting
  functions between various protocols and interfaces in edge networks, and handling
  functions for multiple services in core networks, e.g., the Multi-protocol Label
  Switching (MPLS) technique. Software-defined networking (SDN), on the other hand,
  is expected to be the ideal future for the convergent network since it can provide
  a controllable, dynamic, and cost-effective network. However, SDN has an original
  structural vulnerability behind a lot of advantages, which is the centralized control
  plane. As the brains of the network, a controller manages the whole network, which
  is attractive to attackers. In this context, we proposes a novel solution called
  adaptive suspicious prevention (ASP) mechanism to protect the controller from the
  Denial of Service (DoS) attacks that could incapacitate an SDN. The ASP is integrated
  with OpenFlow protocol to detect and prevent DoS attacks effectively. Our comprehensive
  experimental results show that the ASP enhances the resilience of an SDN network
  against DoS attacks by up to 38%.

  operation. Their scheme is named Cuckoo cache, as its conceptually similar to a
  cache but implemented inside the Cuckoo hash with little additional cost. Cuckoo
  cache is evaluated using a traffic monitoring application fed with real traces.
  The results are compared with existing Cuckoo hashing implementations and show significant
  improvements.

ABS: Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks cause havoc by exploiting threats
  to Internet services. In this paper, we propose E-LDAT, a lightweight extended-entropy
  metric-based system for both DDoS flooding attack detection and IP(Internet Protocol)
  traceback. It aims to identify DDoS attacks effectively by measuring the metric
  difference between legitimate traffic and attack traffic. IP traceback is performed
  using the metric values for an attack sample detected by the detection scheme. The
  method uses a generalized entropy metric with packet intensity computation on the
  sampled network traffic with respect to time. The E-LDAT system has been evaluated
  using several real-world DDoS datasets and outperforms competing methods when detecting
  four classes of DDoS flooding attacks, including constant rate, pulsing rate, increasing
  rate and subgroup attacks. The IP traceback model is also evaluated using NetFlow
  data in near real-time and performs well in large-scale attack networks with zombies.

ABS: IPv6 is an important component of the Internets continued growth and evolution.
  By several metrics, the IPv6 Internet has grown exponentially and now carries non-trivial
  amounts of production traffic. Less well-understood, however, is the IPv6 topology
  and the way in which providers are utilizing their IPv6 address allocations. Rather
  than relying on passive measurements or heuristics, which can bias inferences, we
  instead utilize uniform active probing. We execute ICMP-Paris traceroute probes
  to an address in each /48 in all /32s advertised in the global IPv6 routing table
  (approximately 400M traces from 26 globally distributed vantage points). At this
  granularity, we characterize the distribution of IPv6 interface addresses in the
  wild, and find significant differences among providers and regions. By providing
  insight into the structure of the current IPv6 Internet router interface addressing,
  our hope is to better inform efforts to design future intelligent active IPv6 topology
  mapping algorithms and systems.

ABS: This paper presents a novel defense scheme for DDoS attacks that uses an image
  processing method. This scheme especially focused on the prevalence of adjacent
  neighbor spoofing, called subnet spoofing. It is rarely studied and there is few
  or no feasible approaches than other spoofing attacks. The key idea is that a DDoS
  attack with IP spoofing is represented as a specific pattern such as a line on the
  spatial image planes, which can be recognized through an image processing technique.
  Applying the clustering technique to the lines makes it possible to identify multiple
  attack source networks simultaneously. For the identified networks in which the
  zombie hosts reside, we then employ a signature-based pattern extraction algorithm,
  called a pivoted movement, and the DDoS attacks are filtered by correlating the
  IP and media access control pairing signature. As a result, this proposed scheme
  filters attacks without disturbing legitimate traffic. Unlike previous IP traceback
  schemes such as packet marking and path fingerprinting, which try to diagnose the
  entire attack path, our proposed scheme focuses on identifying only the attack source.
  Our approach can achieve an adaptive response to DDoS attacks, thereby mitigating
  them at the source, while minimizing the disruption of legitimate traffic. The proposed
  scheme is analyzed and evaluated on the IPv4 and IPv6 network topology from CAIDA,
  the results of which show its effectiveness.

GEOLOC: Arlington, TX, US
ABS: Prior approaches to AS-aware path selection in Tor do not consider node bandwidth
  or the other characteristics that Tor uses to ensure load balancing and quality
  of service. Further, since the AS path from the clients exit to her destination
  can only be inferred once the destination is known, the prior approaches may have
  problems constructing circuits in advance, which is important for Tor performance.
  In this paper, we propose and evaluate DeNASA, a new approach to ASaware path selection
  that is destination-naive, in that it does not need to know the clients destination
  to pick paths, and that takes advantage of Tors circuit selection algorithm. To
  this end, we first identify the most probable ASes to be traversed by Tor streams.
  We call this set of ASes the Suspect AS list and find that it consists of eight
  highest ranking Tier 1 ASes. Then, we test the accuracy of Qiu and Gao AS-level
  path inference on identifying the presence of these ASes in the path, and we show
  that inference accuracy is 90%. We develop an AS-aware algorithm called DeNASA that
  uses Qiu and Gao inference to avoid Suspect ASes. DeNASA reduces Tor stream vulnerability
  by 74%. We also show that DeNASA has performance similar to Tor. Due to the destination-naive
  property, time to first byte (TTFB) is close to Tors, and due to leveraging Tors
  bandwidthweighted relay selection, time to last byte (TTLB) is also similar to Tors.

ABS: Tor is susceptible to traffic correlation attacks in which an adversary who observes
  flows entering and leaving the anonymity network can apply statistical techniques
  to correlate flows and de-anonymize their endpoints. While an adversary may not
  be naturally positioned to conduct such attacks, a recent study shows that the Internets
  control-plane can be manipulated to increase an adversarys view of the network,
  and consequently, improve its ability to perform traf- fic correlation. This paper
  explores, in-depth, the effects of control-plane attacks on the security of the
  Tor network. Using accurate models of the live Tor network, we quantify Tors susceptibility
  to these attacks by measuring the fraction of the Tor network that is vulnerable
  and the advantage to the adversary of performing the attacks. We further propose
  defense mechanisms that protect Tor users from manipulations at the control-plane.
  Perhaps surprisingly, we show that by leveraging existing trust anchors in Tor,
  defenses deployed only in the data-plane are sufficient to detect most control-plane
  attacks. Our defenses do not assume the active participation of Internet Service
  Providers, and require only very small changes to Tor. We show that our defenses
  result in a more than tenfold decrease in the effectiveness of certain control-plane
  attacks.

ABS: The Internet reserves numerous potential path diversity among densely connected
  autonomous systems (ASes). However, the Internet routing is controlled by Border
  Gateway Protocol (BGP), which has limitations in the path diversity expression and
  cooperation between ASes. The emergence of software defined networking (SDN) scheme
  provides flexible control over networks. In this paper, we leverage the programmability
  of SDN, and propose a new routing control plane, named RCS. It can support flexible
  inter-domain forwarding control, and enable network functions chaining along inter-domain
  paths. In RCS, network functions are abstracted and disseminated between SDN ASes.
  Customer networks can set up their desired routing paths for particular applications,
  such as multipath routing. RCS can be deployed incrementally to apply SDN to current
  inter-domain settings. In our primary analysis based on BGP data, the provision
  of customizable forwarding control at only a few ASes can lead to a large of potential
  path diversity.

ABS: 'Cloud computing presents a convenient way of accessing services, resources and
  applications over the Internet by shifting the focus of industries and organizations
  from the deployment and day-to-day running of their IT facilities, to provide an
  on-demand, self-service, and pay-as-you-go business model. Despite its increased
  popularity, ensuring security and availability of data, resources and services remains
  an ongoing research challenge. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are
  not a new threat but they remain a major security challenge in achieving a secure
  and guaranteed service and resources in cloud computing. Mitigating DDoS attack
  in cloud computing presents a new dimension to the solutions proffered in traditional
  computing, therefore, this work proposes DDoS defence solutions that identify and
  classify packet traffic as either legitimate or malicious, based on its attributes.
  This thesis has three objectives. Firstly, it investigates a major attribute of
  DDoS attack, the spoofing of source IP address that hides its identity to disallow
  easy traceback or deceive the cloud provider to enjoy certain services accrued to
  a trusted host. Secondly, due to the increased number and sophistication of DDoS
  attacks against cloud services and the magnitude of traffic that needs to be processed,
  the analysis of feature selection methods and classification techniques was carried
  out. Feature selection has been identified as a pre-processing phase in cloud DDoS
  attack defence that could potentially increase the classification accuracy and reduce
  the computational complexity, by identifying important features from the original
  dataset, during supervised learning. Finally, this thesis studies the packet inter-arrival
  time (IAT) feature of traffic traces, in order to determine the presence of an attack
  using a change-point detection. The DDoS attack pattern is detected by leveraging
  on the fact that most DDoS attacks are automated, thus exhibiting similar patterns.
  The main contributions are as follows: (i) This thesis proposes an IP spoofing detection
  technique that uses a passive and active host-based operating system (OS) fingerprinting
  to detect the true source of a packet during a spoofed DDoS attack; (ii) this thesis
  proposes an ensemble-based multi-filter feature selection (EMFFS) method that combines
  the output of four filter methods to achieve an optimum selection, and a decision-tree
  classifier to detect DDoS attacks; and (iii) this thesis proposes a change-point
  monitoring algorithm to detect DDoS flooding attacks against cloud services, by
  examining the packet IAT. A DDoS attack pattern is distinguished from normal traffic
  by using cumulative sum algorithm (CUSUM). The results obtained show a high detection
  rate and classification accuracy, when compared with other classification techniques
  in the literature.'

ABS: In this paper, we firstly introduce a new combined approach to enhance the performance
  of classification in network traffic. The proposed combination mainly focuses on
  taking advantages of two classification algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  and Self Organizing Map (SOM). We utilize both advantages that SVM takes a little
  time to produce outputs with a high accuracy and SOM makes a reliable prediction
  based on their neurons. Next, we propose a hybrid flow-based work mechanism, which
  applies the proposed combination SVMsSOM, for handling with Distributed Denial-of-Service
  (DDoS) attacks and network component protection from resource exhaustion in Software-Defined
  Networking. In the introduced scheme, multiple Linear SVMs first classify flow entries
  existing in flow-tables from OpenFlow switches. In the case that a flows position
  is located between two margin lines or a vague region in the Linear SVM representation,
  it will be then forwarded to a SOM to make a final decision. Afterwards, an attack
  classifier and a policy enforcement module will be applied to attack flows with
  the purpose of attack diminution and the SDN controller protection. Besides, we
  also provide readers with a new view of DDoS attacks in the Software-Defined Networking.
  Thorough practical experiments conducted in the Software Defined Networking environment,
  it is proved that the proposed classification combination outperforms original algorithms,
  and the novel hybrid mechanism can be an effective and innovative approach to face
  with DDoS attacks and protect the OpenFlow switches and the SDN controller from
  being overloaded.

ABS: Network flow watermarking schemes have been used to detect stepping stones, which
  including watermark embedding scheme and detection scheme. Among them, watermark
  embedding scheme plays a vital part in a watermarking scheme. Most existing watermark
  embedding schemes are based on using a randomly select the operation time interval
  and then generated watermark sequence in carrier flow. However, the randomness of
  watermark operating may cause watermark easily exposed to attacks. We herein propose
  a novel watermark embedding scheme based on entropy (NWESBE) to solve this problem.
  We firstly pre-process the carrier traffic by using entropy analysis and then determine
  optimum time intervals for embedding watermark. Secondly, we randomly embed watermark
  in these determined time intervals. Our analytical and empirical results demonstrate
  that our proposed scheme is robust for embedded watermark to timing perturbation,
  while invisible to attacks. And also it can greatly improve the detection rate and
  requiring fewer observation packet.

ABS: Matrices associated with graphs, such as the Laplacian, lead to numerous interesting
  graph problems expressed as linear systems. One field where Laplacian linear systems
  play a role is network analysis, e. g. for certain centrality measures that indicate
  if a node (or an edge) is important in the network. One such centrality measure
  is current-flow closeness. To allow network analysis workflows to profit from a
  fast Laplacian solver, we provide an implementation of the LAMG multigrid solver
  in the NetworKit package, facilitating the computation of current-flow closeness
  values or related quantities. Our main contribution consists of two algorithms that
  accelerate the current-flow computation for one node or a reasonably small node
  subset significantly. One algorithm is an unbiased estimator using sampling, the
  other one is based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform. Our inexact algorithms
  lead to very accurate results in practice. Thanks to them one is now able to compute
  an estimation of current-flow closeness of one node on networks with tens of millions
  of nodes and edges within seconds or a few minutes. From a network analytical point
  of view, our experiments indicate that current-flow closeness can discriminate among
  different nodes significantly better than traditional shortest-path closeness and
  is also considerably more resistant to noise - we thus show that two known drawbacks
  of shortest-path closeness are alleviated by the current - flow variant.

ABS: End-to-End delay is an important performance metric to evaluate the performance
  of many Internet multimedia applications such as, Voice Over IP (VOIP), online gaming,
  cloud computing etc. Especially, the delays at some bottleneck-links of a path account
  for a large proportion of the End-to-End delay. To accurately identify the delays
  at bottleneck-links is a fundamental approach to study the delay feature of Internet,
  and is beneficial to the design of some efficient distributed algorithms. In this
  paper, we utilize real measured probing data to conduct a statistical analysis of
  the relationship between one-way delay and bottleneck-delay, and demonstrate that
  bottleneck-delay appears in 70 % of the paths in Internet. In order to further study
  the features of bottleneck-delay, we propose an IP united mapping scheme which combines
  the IP centralized mapping with the IP geographic mapping. Experiment results show
  that two ends of a bottleneck-link are usually located in the same country, and
  the links with a large number of entrances (in-degrees) and few number of exits
  (out-degrees) or the average shallower links are prone to leading to bottleneck-delays.
  Based on the structural properties of the bottleneck-links, we also give a deep
  discussion about the factors of bottleneck-delays at last, which demonstrates queuing
  delay is a key factor of bottleneck-delay.

  ways dictated by hidden geometric correlations between the individual layers. We
  find that these correlations are strong in different real multiplexes, and form
  a key framework for answering many important questions. Specifically, we show that
  these geometric correlations facilitate: (i) the definition and detection of multidimensional
  communities, which are sets of nodes that are simultaneously similar in multiple
  layers; (ii) accurate trans-layer link prediction, where connections in one layer
  can be predicted by observing the hidden geometric space of another layer; and (iii)
  efficient targeted navigation in the multilayer system using only local knowledge,
  which outperforms navigation in the single layers only if the geometric correlations

ABS: 'Distributed-Denial-Of-Service (DDoS) attacks are one of the more challenging
  security issues on the Internet today. They can easily exhaust the resources of
  the potential victims. The problem is even more exacerbated since the attackers
  often forge their IP addresses to hide their identity. The existing defence mechanisms
  against DDoS attacks usually filter the attack traffic at the victims side. In this
  case, even if the attacking traffic can be filtered by the victim, the attacker
  may reach the goal of blocking access to the victim by consuming the victims computing
  resources or bandwidth. To address this issue, a modular security framework is proposed
  which consists of three main components: Detection, Traceback and Traffic Control.
  These three components can work independently as standalone systems, as well as
  collectively, bound by the proposed framework which aims to facilitate the replacement
  or addition of security modules without affecting the operation of the system as
  a whole. The Detection component aims to detect unusual changes of the incoming
  traffic to identify DDoS attacks. For the Traceback component five different approaches
  to IP-Traceback are proposed: Deterministic Flow Marking (DFM), Probabilistic Flow
  Marking (PFM), Unique Flow Marking (UFM), Deterministic Flow Marking for IPv6 Traceback
  (DFM6) and Autonomous System-based Flow Marking (ASFM). This component enables the
  identification of the origin of the traffic traversing through the Internet on a
  per flow basis, regardless of source IP address spoofing. The above five IP-Traceback
  approaches are designed for different network environments with varying network
  requirements. They all embed a fingerprint in the packets, but each one of them
  has some specific features and performances that make them suitable for various
  situations. For the traffic control component, Traceback-based Defence against DDoS
  Flooding Attacks (TDFA) is proposed. TDFA aims to place the packet filtering as
  close to the attack source as possible. In doing so, the traffic control component
  employs the IP-Traceback component to locate the origin of the attack and then sets
  up a limit on the packet forwarding rate to the victim. TDFA effectively reduces
  attack forwarding rate and improves the throughput of the legitimate traffic.'

  with link weights. This tool source code is freely available at https://bitbucket.org/gfeuillen/hydrogen/overview.
  In this thesis, we first explain how to infer router topologies, we then describe
  the link weights inference and then provide the topologies obtained by combining
  the two firsts parts. Throughout this thesis we provide quality measures of our
  implementation in order to prove its efficiency or find its weaknesses. More specifically,
  these measures allow us to prove that our topologies sometimes present inaccuracies
  (mostly due to shortcomings in the external measurements) while the inference of
  link weights is able to produce weights correctly characterizing the routing.

ABS: Cyber attackers abuse the domain name system (DNS) to mystify their attack ecosystems,
  they systematically generate a huge volume of distinct domain names to make it infeasible
  for blacklisting approaches to keep up with newly generated malicious domain names.
  As a solution to this problem, we propose a system for discovering malicious domain
  names that will likely be abused in future. The key idea with our system is to exploit
  temporal variation patterns (TVPs) of domain names. The TVPs of domain names include
  information about how and when a domain name has been listed in legitimate/popular
  and/or malicious domain name lists. On the basis of this idea, our system actively
  collects DNS logs, analyzes their TVPs, and predicts whether a given domain name
  will be used for malicious purposes. Our evaluation revealed that our system can
  predict malicious domain names 220 days beforehand with a true positive rate of
  0.985.

ABS: With the rapid growth of the Internet, the impact of attacks becomes more serious.
  IP spoofing makes hosts hard to defend against DDoS attacks. In this paper, we propose
  a blind detection method for tracing the real source of DDoS attack packets. Tracing
  the real source of a single-packet is difficult, so we trace-back a cluster of similar
  packets rather than a single-packet by cluster matching. We choose K-harmonic means
  clustering method to preprocess the packets according to our proposed quantitative
  model, at the same time, we propose an approach to determine the best number of
  clusters. In addition, we propose a novel detection algorithm about cluster matching
  for tracing the real source of packet clusters based on K-harmonic means and our
  improved silhouette. Experimental results show that our method can detect the real
  source of packets with up to 92.54% accuracy.

ABS: Despite large-scale flooding attacks, capability-based defense schemes provide
  end hosts with guaranteed communication. However, facing the challenges of enabling
  scalable bandwidth fair sharing and adapting to attack strategies, none of the existing
  schemes adequately stand. In this paper we present Tumbler, a flooding attack defense
  mechanism that provides scalable competition-based bandwidth fairness at the Autonomous
  System (AS) granularity, and on-demand bandwidth allocation for end hosts in each
  AS. Tumbler enforces adaptability in the capability establishment via competition
  factors that are calculated upon leaf ASes bandwidth utilization and reputation.
  Transit ASes independently manage each competition factor based on the corresponding
  feedback from dedicated bandwidth accounting and monitoring policies. Through Internet-scale
  simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Tumbler against a variety of attack
  scenarios and illustrate the deployment benefits for ISPs.

  extends the well-known bitmap sketch to sliding window settings. Based on the CVS,
  a random update mechanism is introduced, whereby a small fixed number of entries
  are randomly chosen from CVS in a step and then updated. This means that the update
  procedure just costs constant time. Furthermore, estimating cardinality by CVS just
  needs one-pass scan of the data. Finally, a theoretical analysis is given to show
  the accuracy of CVS-based estimators. Our comprehensive experiments confirm that
  the CVS-based schema attains high accuracy, and demonstate its time efficiency in

ABS: Denial of service attacks (DoS) are a common threat to many online services.
  These attacks aim to overcome the availability of an online service with massive
  traffic from multiple sources. By spoofing legitimate users, an attacker floods
  a target system with a high quantity of packets or connections to crash its network
  resources, bandwidth, equipment, or servers. Packet filtering methods are the most
  known way to prevent these attacks via identifying and blocking the spoofed attack
  from reaching its target. In this project, the extent of the DoS attacks problem
  and attempts to prevent it are explored. The attacks categories and existing countermeasures
  based on preventing, detecting, and responding are reviewed. Henceforward, a neural
  network learning algorithms and statistical analysis are utilized into the designing

ABS: The Internet relies on its routing infrastructure, a globally spanning distributed
  system of special purpose computers call routers, to deliver packets between hosts.
  In order to build the paths data will travel, routers execute a routing protocol
  called the Border Gateway Protocol, or BGP. BGP is built to be decentralized and
  highly accommodating to arbitrary preferences of the organizations that own routers.
  This dissertation focuses on examining the following thesis statement. The current
  state of BGP, coupled with the Internets extreme level of topological complexity,
  allows adversaries who can interact with BGP routers to degrade the availability
  properties of both the entire Internet routing infrastructure and other Internet-scale
  distributed systems. The research in this work breaks down into two independent
  arcs. The first arc focuses on attacks which aim to disrupt the availability of
  large portions on the Internets routing infrastructure. Through both simulation
  and experimentation with representative devices, this work demonstrates that a variety
  of adversaries can prevent large portions of the Internet from being able to correctly
  build paths to end destinations. The second arc focuses on how those who control
  routers, and therefore can decide how the routers will select paths, can attack
  the availability of distributed systems which closely interact with the transit
  infrastructure of the Internet. Specifically the work shows how, by altering the
  BGP decision making process slightly, a variety of systems, ranging from censorship
  circumvention tools to surveillance systems, can be defeated by such an adversary
  without loss of general connectivity.

ABS: As the Internet of Things technologies evolve, billions of smart devices will
  be connected to the Internet. Therefore, the accelerated growth of users, applications
  and devices pose a great demand on the scalability of the Internet. In this paper,
  we develop a new Internet architecture -- Multiple-inherited Locators (MiL) -- to
  meet the future demand on addressing. MiL is based on Locator/ID addressing and
  hierarchical address allocation. The benefit of this new addressing scheme is the
  improved scalability of Internet routing by enhancing the prefix aggregation of
  locators. The number of locators which are needed grows with the Internet scale.
  In order to represent each locator as a unique binary representation by as few bits
  as possible, we develop a distributed encoding method to efficiently encode locators.
  As the Internet topology evolves, the distributed encoding method renumbering locators
  codeword for the optimal encoding performance, and meanwhile endeavors to keep their
  codewords unchanged as much as possible. Because, we want to represent locators
  by fewer bits as well as keep addressing stable. We adopt an Encoding Table Adjustment
  algorithm to find a sweet spot that balances these two goals. According to our experiment,
  within a 2% increase on the expected locator length, our algorithm reduces the cost
  of renumbering locator by 99.9%.

ABS: Network emulation is a valuable, though potentially resource intensive, method
  for virtualizing networks for analysis or testing. Though high-powered servers are
  becoming increasingly accessible, the size and complexity of physical networks have
  increased in a similar fashion, thereby limiting the type and size of networks that

  that allows the developers of ground truth topologies to distribute the emulation
  requirements across multiple physical machines, thereby increasing the size of networks
  that can be emulated. First, we reexamine existing tools to discover current methods
  for emulating synthetic and physical networks. Then we modify an existing platform
  to enable execution on multiple machines, while increasing flexibility for future
  extensions. We then develop methods for efficiently distributing the topology among
  the available resources in order to maximize the potential scale. Finally, we run
  a series of scenarios simulating real world events, such as a Border Gateway Protocol
  (BGP) hijack attack, in order to demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the system.

ABS: In traditional approach, extracting important features for the application to
  analyze the anomaly detection problem, introduce significant overhead on the way
  of switch handling. Furthermore, high volumes of network traffic introduce notable
  issues that affect the performance and anomaly detection accuracy. Taking advantage
  of centralized control plane of Software Defined Networking (SDN), the task to handle
  the flow information is much more simplified programmatically. The accuracy of the
  measured flow statistic plays important role in anomaly detection. While the use
  of sampling is capable to lessen the scalability problem of traffic monitoring,
  the insufficiency of sampled flow statistic may have led to inaccurate detection
  rate of anomaly. In this paper, we propose an adaptive sampling strategy that is
  able to provide essential traffic statistics for more accurate anomaly detection
  in SDN. Our sampling mechanism utilizes the clustering analysis, which is used to
  classify the attack in the network to determine the severity of monitored traffic.
  By manipulating the type of service of incoming packet together, these two important
  parameter formulate our sampling mechanism algorithm. We show experimentally that
  by putting higher polling frequency on detected anomalous flow, we able to detect
  network attacks much more accurate.

ABS: Network measurement is an important tool for network managers and operators since
  it provides the information needed to carry out different management tasks. However,
  because of the rapid increase in data link speeds and the volume of traffic carried
  by modern networks, the availability of system resources dedicated to network measurement
  has always been the main limiting factor in developing modern measurement solutions.
  The emergence of Software Defined Networks in recent years has inspired the development
  of new measurement solutions that takes advantage of the capabilities offered by
  this new paradigm such as programmability and central management [9]. Current SDN
  enabled measurement solutions are able to orchestrate the execution and resources
  allocation of network-wide measurement tasks but still falls short in their ability
  to recognize efficient operating points (amount of allocated resources) for running
  tasks and often results in inefficient resources utilization. In this paper we provide
  a novel resource allocation method that continuously estimates the resources-accuracy
  relationships for running tasks, infers their individual points of diminishing-returns
  and uses the resulting value of each task as its target point of operation in order
  to achieve a more efficient resource utilization. In contrast to existing work,
  our proposed method maximizes the return on used system resources and results in
  lower drop rates of running tasks as shown by our simulations.

ABS: Watermarking, known as a typical active network traffic analysis technique, has
  been widely used in stepping stone detecting and anonymity tracing. Among several
  different watermarking schemes, the interval centroid based watermarking scheme
  has shown its robustness in the problems such as chaff packet, packet drops and
  repacketization. It can be widely used in many applications, for it embeds watermarking
  signals by adjusting centroids of the network flow intervals. However, this scheme
  requires to select a longer period as an interval, which results in a larger delay
  in network modulation to obtain a higher tracing rate. This will decrease the efficiency
  of the communication. Hence, it faces a difficulty to trace short traffics. In this
  paper, we propose an equalized interval centroid based watermarking scheme which
  significantly shortens the network flow intervals, which is more suitable for tracing
  short traffic flows. We conduct an equalization process to the intervals by redistributing
  the packet timing according to its cumulative distribution function, which makes
  the intervals approximately obey a uniform distribution. After the equalization,
  the centroids of the intervals can reach stable easily even if these intervals are
  short or the packets are locally concentrated. Equalization enable us to choose
  shorter intervals to embed watermarking signals, which can enhance the capacity
  of the watermarking signals. Experimental results show that, our scheme generates
  lower rates of false errors than the traditional one only using a half of intervals,
  and reaches a similar result in tracing short traffic flows. Moreover, it can tolerate
  more deliberate random delay without tuning its parameters.

ABS: Traffic archival, an indispensable task for network analysis, has suffered from
  a huge amount of data. These rapid growing data can exceed storage capacity and
  thwart real-time analysis. In order to take insight from Internet traffic, bitmap
  indexing is applied in this field. However, raw bitmap indexes can consume more
  space and longer delay for loading larger indexes into memory. This leads to the
  invention of various bitmap index compression algorithms to save storage and ensure
  query efficiency. This paper proposes a new algorithm called common affix merging
  with partition. By merging common affixes in a bit sequence, it saves more storage
  and conducts at least one order of magnitude faster bitwise operations when compared
  with ROARING, WAH, CONCISE, and COMPAX. In practice, besides bitwise operations,
  a query should also contain the operations of loading index files into memory. The
  experimental results demonstrate that the speedup is still considerable even taking

  of these systems, our attack inflicts economic losses, in the form of reduced transit
  revenue, on ISPs that deploy them, while at the same time incentivizing ISPs that

ABS: The operators of the Autonomous Systems (ASes) composing the Internet must deal
  with a constant traffic growth, while striving to reduce the overall cost-per-bit
  and keep an acceptable quality of service. These challenges have motivated ASes
  to evolve their infrastructure from basic interconnectivity strategies, using a
  couple transit providers and a few settlement-free peerings, to employ geographically
  scoped transit services (e.g. partial transit) and multiplying their peering efforts.
  Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), facilities allowing the establishment of sessions
  to multiple networks using the same infrastructure. IXPs have hence become central
  entities of the Internet. Although the benefits of a diverse interconnection strategy
  are manifold, it also encumbers the inter-domain traffic engineering process, and
  potentially increases the effects of incompatible interests with neighboring ASes.
  To efficiently manage the inter-domain traffic under such challenges, operators
  should rely on monitoring systems and computer supported decisions. This thesis
  explores the IXP-centric inter-domain environment, the managing obstacles arising
  from it, and proposes mechanisms for operators to tackle them. The thesis is divided
  in two parts. The first part examines and measures the global characteristics of
  the inter-domain ecosystem. We characterize several IXPs around the world, comparing
  them in terms of their number of members and the properties of the traffic they
  exchange. After highlighting the problems arising from the member overlapping among
  IXPs, we introduce remote peering, an interconnection service that facilitates the
  connection to multiple IXPs. We describe this service and measure its adoption in
  the Internet. In the second part of the thesis, we take the position of the network
  operators. We detail the challenges surrounding the control of inter-domain traffic
  in the Internet environment previously described, and introduce an operational framework
  aimed at facilitating its management. Subsequently, we examine methods that peering
  coordinators and network engineers can use to plan their infrastructure investments,
  by quantifying the benefits of new interconnections. Finally, we delve into the
  effects of conflicting business objectives among ASes. These conflicts can result
  in traffic distributions which do not satisfy the (business) interests of one or
  more ASes. We describe these dissatisfactions, differentiating their impact on the
  ingress and egress traffic of a single AS. Furthermore, we develop a warning system
  that operators can use to detect and rank those conflicts. We test our warning system
  using data from two real networks, where we discover a large number of traffic flows
  that do not satisfy the interest of operators, thus stressing the need to identify
  the ones having a larger impact on their network.

  of the end-to-end path are some of the limitations with the existing bilateral model,
  and they need to be overcome for achieving end-to-end performance guarantees. Furthermore,
  due to general reluctance of ASes to disclose their interconnection agreements,
  inference of inter-AS economic relationships depend on routing and forwarding data
  from measurements. Since the inferences are imperfect, this necessitates building
  robust algorithmic strategies to characterize ASes with a significantly higher accuracy.
  In this thesis, we first study the problem of optimizing multi-AS deployments of
  CDN caches in the Internet core. Our work is of significant practical relevance
  since it formalizes the planning process that all CDN operators must follow to reduce
  the operational cost of their overlay networks, while meeting the performance requirements
  of their end users. Next, we focus on developing a temporal cone (TC) algorithm
  that detects PFS (Provider-free ASes). By delivering a significant portion of Internet
  traffic, PFS is highly relevant to the overall resilience of the Internet. We detect
  PFS from public datasets of inter-AS economic relationships, utilizing topological
  statistics (customer cones of ASes) and temporal diversity. Finally, we focus on
  a multilateral contractual arrangement and develop algorithms for optimizing the
  cost of transit and access ASes. In particular, we implement Bertsekas auction algorithm
  for the optimal cost assignment of access ASes to transit ASes. Furthermore, we
  implement an epsilon-greedy bandit algorithm for optimizing the price of transit
  ASes and show its learning potential.'

ABS: 'There are currently no requirements (technical or otherwise) that BGP paths
  must be contained within national boundaries. Indeed, some paths experience international
  detours, i.e., originate in one country, cross international boundaries and return
  to the same country. In most cases these are sensible traffic engineering or peering
  decisions at ISPs that serve multiple countries. In some cases such detours may
  be suspicious. Characterizing international detours is useful to a number of players:
  (a) network engineers trying to diagnose persistent problems, (b) policy makers
  aiming at adhering to certain national communication policies, (c) entrepreneurs
  looking for opportunities to deploy new networks, or (d) privacy-conscious states
  trying to minimize the amount of internal communication traversing different jurisdictions.
  In this paper we characterize international detours in the Internet during the month
  of January 2016. To detect detours we sample BGP RIBs every 8 hours from 461 RouteViews
  and RIPE RIS peers spanning 30 countries. Then geolocate visible ASes by geolocating
  each BGP prefix announced by each AS, mapping its presence at IXPs and geolocation
  infrastructure IPs. Finally, analyze each global BGP RIB entry looking for detours.
  Our analysis shows more than 5K unique BGP prefixes experienced a detour. A few
  ASes cause most detours and a small fraction of prefixes were affected the most.
  We observe about 544K detours. Detours either last for a few days or persist the
  entire month. Out of all the detours, more than 90% were transient detours that
  lasted for 72 hours or less. We also show different countries experience different
  characteristics of detours.'

ABS: 'Brute-force attacks are omnipresent and manyfold on the Internet, and aim at
  compromising user accounts by issuing large numbers of authentication attempts on
  applications and daemons. Widespread targets of such attacks are Secure SHell (SSH)
  and Web applications, for example. The impact of brute-force attacks and compromises
  resulting thereof is often severe: Once compromised, attackers gain access to remote
  machines, allowing those machines to be misused for all sorts of criminal activities,
  such as sharing illegal content and participating in Distributed Denial of Service
  (DDoS) attacks. While the number of brute-force attacks is ever-increasing, we have
  seen that only few brute-force attacks actually result in a compromise. Those compromised
  devices are however those that require attention by security teams, as they may
  be misused for all sorts of malicious activities. We therefore propose a new paradigm
  in this thesis for monitoring network security incidents: compromise detection.
  Compromise detection allows security teams to focus on what is really important,
  namely detecting those hosts that have been compromised instead of all hosts that
  have been attacked. Speaking metaphorically, one could say that we target scored
  goals, instead of just shots on goals. A straightforward approach for compromise
  detection would be host-based, by analyzing network traffic and log files on individual
  hosts. Although this typically yields high detection accuracies, it is infeasible
  in large networks; These networks may comprise thousands of hosts, controlled by
  many persons, on which agents need to be installed. In addition, host-based approaches
  lack a global attack view, i.e., which hosts in the same network have been contacted
  by the same attacker. We therefore take a network-based approach, where sensors
  are deployed at strategic observation points in the network. The traditional approach
  would be packet-based, but both high link speeds and high data rates make the deployment
  of packet-based approaches rather expensive. In addition, the fact that more and
  more traffic is encrypted renders the analysis of full packets useless. Flow-based
  approaches, however, aggregate individual packets into flows, providing major advantages
  in terms of scalability and deployment. The main contribution of this thesis is
  to prove that flow-based compromise detection is viable. Our approach consists of
  several steps. First, we select two target applications, Web applications and SSH,
  which we found to be important targets of attacks on the Internet because of the
  high impact of a compromise and their wide deployment. Second, we analyze protocol
  behavior, attack tools and attack traffic to better understand the nature of these
  attacks. Third, we develop software for validating our algorithms and approach.
  Besides using this software for our own validations (i.e., in which we use log files
  as ground-truth), our open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS) SSHCure is extensively
  used by other parties, allowing us to validate our approach on a much broader basis.
  Our evaluations, performed on Internet traffic, have shown that we can achieve detection
  accuracies between 84% and 100%, depending on the protocol used by the target application,
  quality of the dataset, and the type of the monitored network. Also, the wide deployment
  of SSHCure, as well as other prototype deployments in real networks, have shown
  that our algorithms can actually be used in production deployments. As such, we
  conclude that flow-based compromise detection is viable on the Internet.'

ABS: Measurement capabilities are essential for a variety of network applications,
  such as load balancing, routing, fairness and intrusion detection. These capabilities
  require large counter arrays in order to monitor the traffic of all network flows.
  While commodity SRAM memories are capable of operating at line speed, they are too
  small to accommodate large counter arrays. Previous works suggested estimators,
  which trade precision for reduced space. However, in order to accurately estimate
  the largest counter, these methods compromise the accuracy of the smaller counters.
  In this work, we present a closed form representation of the optimal estimation
  function. We then introduce Independent Counter Estimation Buckets (ICE-Buckets),
  a novel algorithm that improves estimation accuracy for all counters. This is achieved
  by separating the flows to buckets and configuring the optimal estimation function
  according to each buckets counter scale. We prove a tighter upper bound on the relative
  error and demonstrate an accuracy improvement of up to 57 times on real Internet
  packet traces.

ABS: Recent IPv4 address exhaustion events are ushering in a new era of rapid transition
  to the next generation Internet protocol - IPv6. Via Internet-scale experiments
  and data analysis, this dissertation characterizes the adoption and security of
  the emerging IPv6 network. The work includes three studies, each the largest of
  its kind, examining various facets of the new network protocols deployment, routing
  maturity, and security. The first study provides an analysis of ten years of IPv6
  deployment data, including quantifying twelve metrics across ten global-scale datasets,
  and affording a holistic understanding of the state and recent progress of the IPv6
  transition. Based on cross-dataset analysis of relative global adoption rates and
  across features of the protocol, we find evidence of a marked shift in the pace
  and nature of adoption in recent years and observe that higher-level metrics of
  adoption lag lower-level metrics. Next, a network telescope study covering the IPv6
  address space of the majority of allocated networks provides insight into the early
  state of IPv6 routing. Our analyses suggest that routing of average IPv6 prefixes
  is less stable than that of IPv4. This instability is responsible for the majority
  of the captured misdirected IPv6 traffic. Observed dark (unallocated destination)
  IPv6 traffic shows substantial differences from the unwanted traffic seen in IPv4---in
  both character and scale. Finally, a third study examines the state of IPv6 network
  security policy. We tested a sample of 25 thousand routers and 520 thousand servers
  against sets of TCP and UDP ports commonly targeted by attackers. We found systemic
  discrepancies between intended security policy---as codified in IPv4---and deployed
  IPv6 policy. Such lapses in ensuring that the IPv6 network is properly managed and
  secured are leaving thousands of important devices more vulnerable to attack than
  before IPv6 was enabled. Taken together, findings from our three studies suggest
  that IPv6 has reached a level and pace of adoption, and shows patterns of use, that
  indicates serious production employment of the protocol on a broad scale. However,
  weaker IPv6 routing and security are evident, and these are leaving early dual-stack
  networks less robust than the IPv4 networks they augment.

ABS: The monitoring and management of high-volume feature-rich traffic in large networks
  offers significant challenges in storage, transmission and computational costs.
  The predominant approach to reducing these costs is based on performing a linear
  mapping of the data to a low-dimensional subspace such that a certain large percentage
  of the variance in the data is preserved in the low-dimensional representation.
  This variance-based subspace approach to dimensionality reduction forces a fixed
  choice of the number of dimensions, is not responsive to real-time shifts in observed
  traffic patterns, and is vulnerable to normal traffic spoofing. Based on theoretical
  insights proved in this paper, we propose a new distance-based approach to dimensionality
  reduction motivated by the fact that the real-time structural differences between
  the covariance matrices of the observed and the normal traffic is more relevant
  to anomaly detection than the structure of the training data alone. Our approach,
  called the distance-based subspace method, allows a different number of reduced
  dimensions in different time windows and arrives at only the number of dimensions
  necessary for effective anomaly detection. We present centralized and distributed
  versions of our algorithm and, using simulation on real traffic traces, demonstrate
  the qualitative and quantitative advantages of the distance-based subspace approach.

ABS: Link prediction is becoming a concerned topic in the complex network field in
  recent years. However, the existing link prediction methods are unsatisfactory for
  processing topological information and have high time complexity. This paper presents
  a novel method of Link Prediction with Community Structure (LPCS) based on hyperbolic
  mapping. Different from the existing link prediction methods, to utilize global
  structure information of the network, LPCS deals with the network from an overall
  perspective. LPCS takes full advantage of the community structure and its hierarchical
  organization to map networks into hyperbolic space, and obtains the hyperbolic coordinates
  which depict the global structure information of the network, then uses hyperbolic
  distance to describe the similarity between the nodes, finally predicts missing
  links according to the degree of the similarity between unconnected node pairs.
  The combination of the hyperbolic geometry framework and the community structure
  makes LPCS perform well in predicting missing links, and the time complexity of
  LPCS is linear, which makes LPCS can be applied to handle large scale networks in
  acceptable time. LPCS outperforms many state-of-the-art link prediction methods
  in the networks obeying power-law degree distribution.

ABS: A low-rate distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack has the ability to obscure
  its traffic because it is very similar to legitimate traffic. It can easily evade
  current detection mechanisms. Rank correlation measures can quantify significant
  differences between attack traffic and legitimate traffic based on their rank values.
  In this paper, we use two rank correlation measures, namely, Spearmen Rank Correlation
  (SRC) and Partial Rank Correlation (PRC) to detect low-rate DDoS attacks. These
  measures are empirically evaluated using three real-life datasets. Experimental
  results show that both measures can effectively discriminate legitimate traffic
  from attack traffic. We find that PRC performs better than SRC in detection of low-rate
  DDoS attacks in terms of spacing between malicious and legitimate traffic.

ABS: It has been widely agreed that the architecture of the Internet is ossified.
  Many advanced technologies were proposed to deal with the shortcomings of the Internet,
  such as Quality of Service (QoS), IP multicast, and BGP multipath, but they have
  not been deployed widely in the Internet. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has
  attracted many interests in the research community. The key insight of ICN is that
  the usage of the Internet has dramatically changed from connecting nodes to accessing
  information. By the inspiration of ICN thinking, we argue that it is not the ossification
  of the IP architecture which matters, but the ossification of the business model
  between ISPs. In this paper, we propose a Supply Chain Management (SCM) based business
  model to regulate the business relationships between ISPs. The payment flow along
  Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is changed from the conventional bottom up mode
  to a chain like mode, very similar to the payment flow of SCM. Simulation results
  show that the average Autonomous System (AS) hops can be reduced by 47% at most.
  The hit ratio of replicated contents can be improved by 28% at most, and the profit
  change of various ASes is almost balanced.

ABS: 'Short flows are highly valuable in the modern Internet and are widely used by
  applications in the form of web requests or with user interactions. These kinds
  of applications are extremely sensitive to latency. A small additional delay, like
  one or two round trip times (RTTs), may easily cause user frustration and lose usability
  of services. In the most desirable scenario, we want to finish these kinds of flows
  in one network RTT. Furthermore, we would like the networks RTT to be as close as
  possible to the speed of light. Unfortunately, in the current Internet, there are
  many unnecessary delays caused by different kinds of policies - in particular, transmission
  protocol and routing policies - driving us far away from this goal. This thesis
  aims at answering the following two questions: How can we optimize the transmission
  protocol to reduce short flows latency as close as possible to one RTT and why are
  network RTTs still significantly larger than the speed-of-light latency? To reduce
  the transmission latency, we focused on the two main components of short flows,
  connection establishment and data transmission. ASAP, a new naming and transport
  protocol, is introduced to reduce the time spent on initial TCP connections. It
  merges functionality of DNS and TCPs connection establishment functions by piggybacking
  the connection establishment procedure atop the DNS lookup process. With the help
  of ASAP, the host is able to save up to two-thirds of the time spent on initial
  connection without exposing significant DoS vulnerabilities. For data transmission,
  we designed a new control rate mechanism, Halfback, which achieves low latency with
  limited bandwidth overhead and only requires sender-side changes. Halfback has an
  aggressive startup phase, finishing transmission for most short flows in one RTT,
  together with a Reverse-Ordering Proactively Retransmission phase which helps the
  host to recovery quickly from packet loss caused by the aggressive startup phase.
  Halfback is able to achieve 56% smaller flow completion time on average and three
  times smaller in the 99th percentile. RTT between two hosts is able to be more than
  6 times the speed-of-light latency for Directed Optical Fiber. To understand the
  composition of RTT inflation, we break down the path inflation on the end-to-end
  path into its contribution factors. Based on our result, 7.2% is caused by network
  topology, 18.8% is contributed by inter-domain routing policies, 54.9% is caused
  by peering policies, and 25.6% is caused by intradomain routing policies. This result
  shows that the main component of the path inflaii tion is caused by peering policies
  which may require more attention for future research. Besides this, we also analyze
  the changes of the inflation caused by each contributing factor across five years.
  According to our analysis, the total inflation has been reduced by around 6% each
  year since 2010.'

  indicator of single Autonomous Systems, the organizational units of the Internet

ABS: 'Previous research in interdomain routing security has often focused on prefix
  hijacking. However, several prefix interception events have happened lately, which
  poses a new security challenge to the interdomain routing system. Compared to prefix
  hijacking, prefix interception is much harder to detect, as it avoids black hole
  by forwarding the hijacked traffic back to the victim. In this paper, we present
  a novel method to detect prefix interception. Our approach exploits a key observation
  about prefix interception: during a prefix interception event, the attacker detours
  the intercepted traffic through its network, which turns it into a new important
  transit point for access to the victim. By collecting data plane information to
  detect the emerging transit point and using control plane information to verify

ABS: We introduce models and algorithmic foundations for graph watermarking. Our frameworks
  include security definitions and proofs, as well as characterizations when graph
  watermarking is algorithmically feasible, in spite of the fact that the general
  problem is NP-complete by simple reductions from the subgraph isomorphism or graph
  edit distance problems. In the digital watermarking of many types of files, an implicit
  step in the recovery of a watermark is the mapping of individual pieces of data,
  such as image pixels or movie frames, from one object to another. In graphs, this
  step corresponds to approximately matching vertices of one graph to another based
  on graph invariants such as vertex degree. Our approach is based on characterizing
  the feasibility of graph watermarking in terms of keygen, marking, and identification
  functions defined over graph families with known distributions. We demonstrate the
  strength of this approach with exemplary watermarking schemes for two random graph
  models, the classic Erdos-Renyi model and a random power-law graph model, both of
  which are used to model real-world networks.

ABS: Traffic correlation attacks to de-anonymize Tor users are possible when an adversary
  is in a position to observe traffic entering and exiting the Tor network. Recent
  work has brought attention to the threat of these attacks by network-level adversaries
  (e.g., Autonomous Systems). We perform a historical analysis to understand how the
  threat from AS-level traffic correlation attacks has evolved over the past five
  years. We find that despite a large number of new relays added to the Tor network,
  the threat has grown. This points to the importance of increasing AS-level diversity
  in addition to capacity of the Tor network. We identify and elaborate on common
  pitfalls of AS-aware Tor client design and construction. We find that succumbing
  to these pitfalls can negatively impact three major aspects of an AS-aware Tor client
  - (1) security against AS-level adversaries, (2) security against relay-level adversaries,
  and (3) performance. Finally, we propose and evaluate a Tor client - Cipollino-
  which avoids these pitfalls using state-of-the-art in network-measurement. Our evaluation
  shows that Cipollino is able to achieve better security against networklevel adversaries
  while maintaining security against relaylevel adversaries and performance characteristics
  comparable to the current Tor client.

ABS: Sketch-based data streaming algorithms are capable of summarizing high-speed
  network traffic in real-time without packet sampling. Therefore, they are used in
  many networking applications to make accurate estimates of traffic flow statistics.
  However, fixed hardware implementation of the sketch counters limits the flexibility
  of re-using the same data structure for various monitoring applications. In this
  paper, we propose a generic scheme for collecting flow-level data using high-speed
  memories on the NetFPGA-10G platform. The purpose is to enable sketch-based algorithms
  making statistics measurements in various network monitoring applications in a flexible
  manner. Experiments using real Internet traces are conducted for entropy estimation,
  superspreader detection, and change detection applications. The results show that
  the proposed scheme can support flexible selection of keys and counters for the
  monitoring applications achieving high measurement accuracy.

ABS: 'Today, the Internet security community largely emphasizes cyberspace monitoring
  for the purpose of generating cyber intelligence. In this paper, we present a survey
  on darknet. The latter is an effective approach to observe Internet activities and
  cyber attacks via passive monitoring. We primarily define and characterize darknet
  and indicate its alternative names. We further list other trap-based monitoring
  systems and compare them to darknet. Moreover, in order to provide realistic measures
  and analysis of darknet information, we report case studies, namely, Conficker worm
  in 2008 and 2009, Sality SIP scan botnet in 2011, and the largest amplification
  attack in 2014. Finally, we provide a taxonomy in relation to darknet technologies
  and identify research gaps that are related to three main darknet categories: deployment,
  traffic analysis, and visualization. Darknet projects are found to monitor various
  cyber threat activities and are distributed in one third of the global Internet.
  We further identify that Honeyd is probably the most practical tool to implement
  darknet sensors, and future deployment of darknet will include mobile-based VOIP
  technology. In addition, as far as darknet analysis is considered, computer worms
  and scanning activities are found to be the most common threats that can be investigated
  throughout darknet; Code Red and Slammer/Sapphire are the most analyzed worms. Furthermore,
  our study uncovers various lacks in darknet research. For instance, less than 1%
  of the contributions tackled distributed reflection denial of service (DRDoS) amplification
  investigations, and at most 2% of research works pinpointed spoofing activities.
  Last but not least, our survey identifies specific darknet areas, such as IPv6 darknet,
  event monitoring, and game engine visualization methods that require a significantly
  greater amount of attention from the research community.'

ABS: Graph analysis uses graph data collected on a physical, biological, or social
  phenomena to shed light on the underlying dynamics and behavior of the agents in
  that system. Many fields contribute to this topic including graph theory, algorithms,
  statistics, machine learning, and linear algebra. This dissertation advances a novel
  framework for dynamic graph analysis that combines numerical, statistical, and streaming
  algorithms to provide deep understanding into evolving networks. For example, one
  can be interested in the changing influence structure over time. These disparate
  techniques each contribute a fragment to understanding the graph; however, their
  combination allows us to understand dynamic behavior and graph structure. Spectral
  partitioning methods rely on eigenvectors for solving data analysis problems such
  as clustering. Eigenvectors of large sparse systems must be approximated with iterative
  methods. This dissertation analyzes how data analysis accuracy depends on the numerical
  accuracy of the eigensolver. This leads to new bounds on the residual tolerance
  necessary to guarantee correct partitioning. We present a novel stopping criterion
  for spectral partitioning guaranteed to satisfy the Cheeger inequality along with
  an empirical study of the performance on real world networks such as web, social,
  and e-commerce networks. This work bridges the gap between numerical analysis and

ABS: Existing secure interdomain routing protocols can verify validity properties
  about individual routes, such as whether they correspond to a real network path.
  It is often useful to verify more complex properties relating to the route decision
  procedure - for example, whether the chosen route was the best one available, or
  whether it was consistent with the networks peering agreements. However, this is
  difficult to do without knowing a networks routing policy and full routing state,
  which are not normally disclosed. In this paper, we show how a network can allow
  its peers to verify a number of nontrivial properties of its interdomain routing
  decisions without revealing any additional information. If all the properties hold,
  the peers learn nothing beyond what the interdomain routing protocol already reveals;
  if a property does not hold, at least one peer can detect this and prove the violation.
  We present SPIDeR, a practical system that applies this approach to the Border Gateway
  Protocol, and we report results from an experimental evaluation to demonstrate that
  SPIDeR has a reasonable overhead.

ABS: Tracing IP packets to their sources, known as IP-Traceback, is a critical task
  in defending against IP spoofing and DoS attacks. There are several solutions to
  traceback to the origin of the attack. However, all these solutions require either
  all routers or ISPs to support the same IP-Traceback mechanism. To address this
  limitation, we propose an IP-Traceback approach at the level of autonomous systems,
  called Autonomous System-based Flow Marking, ASFM, to identify some key locations
  in the path where attacker packets are being forwarded. ASFM employs the BGP update
  message community attribute that enables information to be passed across ASs even
  if they are not necessarily involved in the IP-Traceback scheme. We also propose
  an authentication method, so a downstream AS can examine the correctness of the
  marking provided by the upstream ASs, thus eliminating the fake marking embedded
  by subverted routers. Finally, we evaluate and analyze the performance of our proposal,
  using real life datasets.

ABS: Cloud computing is the latest trend in business for providing software, platforms
  and services over the Internet. However, a widespread adoption of this paradigm
  has been hampered by the lack of security mechanisms. In view of this, the aim of
  this work is to propose a new approach for detecting anomalies in cloud network
  traffic. The anomaly detection mechanism works on the basis of a Support Vector
  Machine (SVM). The key requirement for improving the accuracy of the SVM model,
  in the context of cloud, is to reduce the total amount of data. In light of this,
  we put forward the Poisson Moving Average predictor which is the core of the feature
  extraction approach and is able to handle the vast amount of information generated
  over time. In addition, two case studies are employed to validate the effectiveness
  of the mechanism on the basis of real datasets. Compared with other approaches,
  our solution exhibits the best performance in terms of detection and false alarm
  rates.

  for inter-domain traffic routing in the future Internet. We consider a general network
  topology with multiple sources and sinks of traffic, organized into separate domains
  managed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) solely interested in maximizing their
  own profit. In this framework, we prove that there exists a pricing scheme that
  attains network-wide efficiency and is yet coalitionally stable, where the coalitions
  correspond to the ISPs that are acting in self-interest. This implies that this
  pricing scheme not only maximizes the overall utility of the resulting traffic flows,
  but is also such that ISPs cannot expect to improve their profit through deviation
  from it, even if multiple ISPs deviate at the same time. Through simulations on
  scale-free preferential attachment network topology models as well as actual inter-domain
  topologies obtained from the CAIDA database, we evaluate the convergence of best-response
  based simple price updates, and show that they quickly attain near-optimal network
  utility in these network topologies.

ABS: Online anonymous communication is an important service used by individuals, journalists,
  government agencies and law enforcement agencies. One of the most popular uses of
  online anonymity is web browsing which necessitates using a low latency anonymity
  system. Unfortunately, these systems are typically vulnerable to the correlation
  attack, where an adversary that can observe the parts of a clients flow that enter
  and leave the system, can deanonymize the client. Recent research has shown that
  network layer adversaries pose far greater threat to anonymity systems than previously
  thought. By manipulating the Internets control-plane, i.e., BGP, an adversary can
  increase its view of the network and improve its ability to deanonymize clients.
  In this dissertation, we study in depth these network level adversaries, attacks
  against BGP and their effects on the security of Tor. We propose and evaluate defenses
  against these attacks. In order to evaluate the aforementioned threats, we construct
  accurate models of the Internet. Our models preserve important details of the Tor
  network, such as end to end latency and path of Autonomous Systems, of network routes.
  Using these highly granular models, we emulate a scaled down version of the Tor
  network. Our emulations allow us to examine the performance of Tor and potential
  compromise due to an AS adversary under different relay selection strategies. Using
  an AS level model, we explore the effects of control-plane attacks on the security
  of Tor. We quantify Tors susceptibility to these attacks by measuring the fraction
  of the Tor network that is vulnerable, and the advantage the adversary attains by
  performing the attacks. We show that 13% of Tors ingress bandwidth, at the median,
  is susceptible to an adversary which hijacks six prefixes. We propose defense mechanisms
  to protect Tor users from manipulation at the control-plane. Our defenses require
  low overhead, do not assume the active participation of Internet Service Providers,
  and require small changes to Tor. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of
  our defenses, and show that they result in a more than tenfold decrease in the effectiveness
  of the control-plane attacks, preventing the attack entirely from many ASes.

ABS: Todays Internet usage evolves rapidly from host-to-host communication to content
  dissemination. Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is proposed to embrace this trend
  by providing in-network caching capability via built-in Content Store (CS). However,
  to satisfy per-packet queries in high-speed networks, CS suffers a noticeable performance
  penalty and probably becomes the bottleneck of the entire packet forwarding system.
  The state-of-the-art adopts skip list as CSs underlying data structure. But, due
  to its O(logn) search complexity, it still has performance issues. In this work,
  inspired by the extensively existed temporal and spatial locality in content retrieval,
  we propose locality-aware skip list for performance improvement. In our design,
  since a packet is likely to share a prefix with previous packets, the search in
  the skip list could start directly from near the previously reached node of that
  prefix. This avoids searches repeatedly starting from the head node thus saves considerable

ABS: 'Incremental and approximate computations are increasingly being adopted for
  data analytics to achieve low-latency execution and efficient utilization of computing
  resources. Incremental computation updates the output incrementally instead of re-computing
  everything from scratch for successive runs of a job with input changes. Approximate
  computation returns an approximate output for a job instead of the exact output.
  Both paradigms rely on computing over a subset of data items instead of computing
  over the entire dataset, but they differ in their means for skipping parts of the
  computation. Incremental computing relies on the memoization of intermediate results
  of sub-computations, and reusing these memoized results across jobs. Approximate
  computing relies on representative sampling of the entire dataset to compute over
  a subset of data items. In this paper, we observe that these two paradigms are complementary,
  and can be married together! Our idea is quite simple: design a sampling algorithm
  that biases the sample selection to the memoized data items from previous runs.
  To realize this idea, we designed an online stratified sampling algorithm that uses
  self-adjusting computation to produce an incrementally updated approximate output
  with bounded error. We implemented our algorithm in a data analytics system called
  IncApprox based on Apache Spark Streaming. Our evaluation using micro-benchmarks
  and real-world case-studies shows that IncApprox achieves the benefits of both incremental
  and approximate computing.'

ABS: In this work we outline a framework for measurement-based performance evaluation
  in SDN environments. The SDN paradigm, which is based on a strict separation of
  the network logic from the underlying physical substrate, necessitates a comprehensive
  global view of the network state. To augment the network representation, we propose
  mechanisms for extracting traffic characteristics from network observations which
  are used to derive performance metrics. Such metrics can be exploited by SDN applications
  to optimize the performance of SDN services. Given the bursty nature of network
  traffic and the well known adverse impact of this property on network performance,
  we propose an approach for extracting flow autocorrelations from switch counters.
  Our main contribution is a random sampling approach that reduces the monitoring
  overhead while enabling a fine grained characterization of the flow autocorrelation
  structure. We analytically evaluate the impact of random sampling and demonstrate
  how services may use the estimated traffic properties to compute useful performance
  metrics.

  By using different types and brands of network equipment force an organization to
  employ a specialist on every brand. Different configuration of different systems
  also increases the possibility of network misconfiguration which is highly dangerous
  situation for the organization itself. Thus, there is a need for a new technology
  to make networks more scalable, dynamic and to allow easier management of network
  devices from different vendors. Thus, there is an urgency for a new innovation to
  make arranges more adaptable, element and to permit less demanding administration

ABS: Addressing, routing, and forwarding in the Internet must form a coherent architecture
  that satisfies user and technical requirements, such as performance, robustness,
  and efficiency. This paper presents the Core-Rooted Path Addressing (CRPA) architecture,
  which is a novel combination of mostly known architectural components. CRPA is designed
  as a network layer for physical topologies and combines a generic rendezvous service
  with the path addressing principle. The benefits of CRPA include forwarding components
  that are completely independent of dynamic routing, as well as compact forwarding
  tables. The key challenge for such a design is the overall practicality of its addressing
  scheme. This paper investigates the characteristics of CRPA using Internet topology
  analysis and simulation, and the findings indicate that it is practicable. Forwarding
  table sizes are quite manageable, and the frequency and scope of dynamic updates
  are reduced. While actual deployment might be unrealistic in the current Internet
  ecosystem, its straightforward design can make CRPA a valuable benchmark for systematic
  reasoning about network architecture.

ABS: In this paper, we investigate collaborative schemes to mitigate Distributed Denial
  of Service attacks in multi-domain Software Defined Networks (SDNs). The mitigation
  process itself is distributed, initiated by the domain of the victim, and involving
  all domains in the path of an attack (transit domains). We emphasize on filtering
  malicious flows as close to the attack sources as possible. We propose a modular
  and scalable approach that leverages on the SDNi (SDN interface) protocol, as the
  enabler for information exchange between adjacent SDN domains. We extend this protocol
  by publishing and exchanging pointers to incident reports, formatted according to
  the IETF IODEF standards and exposed through domain SDN Controllers. Thus, an SDN
  domain hosting the victim of the attack is able to notify the recipients about the
  malicious flows that they forward, requesting their filtering until the attack ceases.
  In order to motivate close cooperation of SDN domains governed by diverse authorities,
  we implemented and evaluated a reputation mechanism, whereby domains historically
  assess the behavior of their neighbors, discouraging assistance in case the domain
  of the victim has a poor cooperation track record.

ABS: 'In data center and ISP networks, many monitoring tasks are not at a single network
  device and require coordination across many devices. Because network devices have
  different views of traffic and different capabilities of monitoring traffic properties,
  it is useful for one device to tell another one which flows to monitor at which
  time, rather than monitoring all the flows all the time. In this paper, we present
  MOZART (MOnitor flowZ At the Right Time), which enables temporal coordination across
  network devices. MOZART includes two key components: the selectors which capture
  network events and select related flows, and the monitors which collect flow-level
  statistics of the selected flows. We design temporal coordination algorithms and
  mechanisms across selectors and monitors to maximize the monitoring accuracy while
  staying within memory constraints. We also optimize the placement of selectors and
  monitors to support the maximum number of monitoring tasks. We implement MOZART
  in an Open vSwitch-based testbed and run extensive experiments with real traffic
  traces. Our results show a reduction of the false negative ratio from 15% to 1%
  compared to the existing method without coordination.'

ABS: Inter-domain routing is the most critical function of the Internet. The routing
  system is a logical network relying on the physical infrastructure with geographical
  characteristics. Nature disasters or disruptive accidents such as earthquakes, cable
  cuts and power outages could cause regional failures which fail down geographically
  co-located network nodes and links, therefore, affect the resilience of inter-domain
  routing system. This paper presents a model for regional failures in inter-domain
  routing system called REFER for the first time. Based on REFER, the resilience of
  the inter-domain routing system could be evaluated on a finer level of the Internet,
  considering different routing policies of intra-domain and inter-domain routing
  systems. Under this model, we perform simulations on an empirical topology of the
  Internet with geographical characteristics to simulate a regional failure locating
  at a city with important IXP (Internet eXchange Point). Results indicate that the
  Internet is robust under a city-level regional failure. The reachability is almost
  the same after the failure, and the reroutings occur at the edge of the Internet,
  hardly affecting the core of inter-domain routing system.

ABS: Identifying heavy hitter flows is a fundamental problem in various network domains.
  The well established method of using sketches to approximate flow statistics suffers
  from space inefficiencies. In addition, flow arrival rates are dynamic, thus keeping
  track of the most recent heavy hitters poses a challenge. Sliding window approximations
  address this problem, reducing space at the cost of increasing point query time.
  This paper presents two novel algorithms for identifying heavy hitters in streams
  and sliding windows. Both algorithms use statically allocated memory and support
  constant time point queries. For sliding windows, this is an asymptotic improvement
  over previous work. We also demonstrate reduced memory requirements of up to 85%
  in streams and 66% in sliding windows over synthetic and real Internet packet traces.

ABS: Denial of Service (DoS)/ DDoS attack is a common and severe problem for network
  security researchers and practitioners. Attackers often generate attack traffic
  that behaves similar to normal network traffic using sophisticated attacking tools.
  Many intrusion detection systems fail to detect anomalous packets in real time.
  In this paper, we use a Multivariate Correlation Analysis (MCA) approach to distinguish
  attack traffic from normal traffic. This statistical measure is used to analyze
  the behavior of network traffic for attack detection. Since DDoS attack traffic
  behaves differently from legitimate network traffic, statistical properties of various
  parameters reflect the changed behavior of network traffic. We extract three basic
  parameters of network traffic, viz., entropy of source IPs, variation of source
  IPs and packet rate to analyze the behavior of network traffic during attack detection.
  The method is validated using several benchmark datasets.

ABS: The Internet is often thought to be a model of resilience, due to a decentralised,
  organically-grown architecture. This paper puts this perception into perspective
  through the results of a security analysis of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
  routing infrastructure. BGP is a fundamental Internet protocol and its intrinsic
  fragilities have been highlighted extensively in the literature. A seldom studied
  aspect is how robust the BGP infrastructure actually is as a result of nearly three
  decades of perpetual growth. Although global black-outs seem unlikely, local security
  events raise growing concerns on the robustness of the backbone. In order to better
  protect this critical infrastructure, it is crucial to understand its topology in
  the context of the weaknesses of BGP and to identify possible security scenarios.
  Firstly, we establish a comprehensive threat model that classifies main attack vectors,
  including but non limited to BGP vulnerabilities. We then construct maps of the
  European BGP backbone based on publicly available routing data. We analyse the topology
  of the backbone and establish several disruption scenarios that highlight the possible
  consequences of different types of attacks, for different attack capabilities. We
  also discuss existing mitigation and recovery strategies, and we propose improvements
  to enhance the robustness and resilience of the backbone. To our knowledge, this
  study is the first to combine a comprehensive threat analysis of BGP infrastructures
  withadvanced network topology considerations. We find that the BGP infrastructure
  is at higher risk than already understood, due to topologies that remain vulnerable
  to certain targeted attacks as a result of organic deployment over the years. Significant
  parts of the system are still uncharted territory, which warrants further investigation
  in this direction.

GEOLOC: Zurich, CH
ABS: Modern Internet applications, from HD video-conferencing to health monitoring
  and remote control of power-plants, pose stringent demands on network latency, bandwidth
  and availability. An approach to support such applications and provide inter-domain
  guarantees, enabling new avenues for innovation, is using centralized inter-domain
  routing brokers. These entities centralize routing control for mission-critical
  traffic across domains, working in parallel to BGP. In this work, we propose using
  IXPs as natural points for stitching inter-domain paths under the control of inter-domain
  routing brokers. To evaluate the potential of this approach, we first map the global
  substrate of inter-IXP pathlets that IXP members could offer, based on measurements
  for 229 IXPs worldwide. We show that using IXPs as stitching points has two useful
  properties. Up to 91% of the total IPv4 address space can be served by such inter-domain
  routing brokers when working in concert with just a handful of large IXPs and their
  associated ISP members. Second, path diversity on the inter-IXP graph increases
  by up to 29 times, as compared to current BGP valley-free routing. To exploit the
  rich path diversity, we introduce algorithms that inter-domain routing brokers can
  use to embed paths, subject to bandwidth and latency constraints. We show that our
  algorithms scale to the sizes of the measured graphs and can serve diverse simulated
  path request mixes. Our work highlights a novel direction for SDN innovation across
  domains, based on logically centralized control and programmable IXP fabrics.

GEOLOC: Princeton, NJ, US
ABS: Software-Defined Networking (SDN) allows control applications to install fine-grained
  forwarding policies in the underlying switches. While Ternary Content Addressable
  Memory (TCAM) enables fast lookups in hardware switches with flexible wildcard rule
  patterns, the cost and power requirements limit the number of rules the switches
  can support. To make matters worse, these hardware switches cannot sustain a high
  rate of updates to the rule table. In this paper, we show how to give applications
  the illusion of high-speed forwarding, large rule tables, and fast updates by combining
  the best of hardware and software processing. Our CacheFlow system caches the most
  popular rules in the small TCAM, while relying on software to handle the small amount
  of cache miss traffic. However, we cannot blindly apply existing cache-replacement
  algorithms, because of dependencies between rules with overlapping patterns. Rather
  than cache large chains of dependent rules, we splice long dependency chains to
  cache smaller groups of rules while preserving the semantics of the policy. Experiments
  with our CacheFlow prototype---on both real and synthetic workloads and policies---demonstrate
  that rule splicing makes effective use of limited TCAM space, while adapting quickly
  to changes in the policy and the traffic demands.

  is used to produce a mean opinion score estimate. The mapping is introduced to reduce
  the size of the problem in order to improve computation times and improve accuracy
  of estimates. The results of testing show that estimating mean opinion score from
  this model is not desirable. It also shows that the path mapping does not affect

ABS: Comparative network analysis is an emerging line of research that provides insights
  into the structure and dynamics of networks by finding similarities and discrepancies
  in their topologies. Unfortunately, comparing networks directly is not feasible
  on large scales. Existing works resort to representing networks with vectors of
  features extracted from their topologies and employ various distance metrics to
  compare between these feature vectors. In this paper, instead of relying on feature
  vectors to represent the studied networks, we suggest fitting a network model (such
  as Kronecker Graph) to encode the network structure. We present the directed fitting-distance
  measure, where the distance from a network AA to another network BB is captured
  by the quality of BBs fit to the model derived from AA. Evaluation on five classes
  of real networks shows that KronFit based distances perform surprisingly well.

ABS: Internet eXchange Points (IXP) are critical components of the Internet infrastructure
  that affect its performance, evolution, security and economics. In this work, we
  introduce techniques to augment the well-known traceroute tool with the capability
  of identifying if and where exactly IXPs are crossed in end-to-end paths. Knowing
  this information can help end-users have more transparency over how their traffic
  flows in the Internet. Our tool, called traIXroute, exploits data from the PeeringDB
  (PDB) and the Packet Clearing House (PCH) about IXP IP addresses of BGP routers,
  IXP members, and IXP prefixes. We show that the used data are both rich, i.e., we
  find 12,716 IP addresses of BGP routers in 460 IXPs, and mostly accurate, i.e.,
  our validation shows 92-93 % accuracy. In addition, 78.2 % of the detected IXPs
  in our data are based on multiple diverse evidence and therefore help have higher
  confidence on the detected IXPs than when relying solely on IXP prefixes. To demonstrate
  the utility of our tool, we use it to show that one out of five paths in our data
  cross an IXP and that paths do not normally cross more than a single IXP, as it
  is expected based on the valley-free model about Internet policies. Furthermore,
  although the top IXPs both in terms of paths and members are located in Europe,
  US IXPs attract many more paths than their number of members indicates.

ABS: 'In Software-Defined Networking (SDN), central controllers can obtain global
  views of dynamic network statistics to manage their networks. In order to support
  SDN controllers to obtain global information of the networks, the data planes need
  to maintain a large number of counters, which are typically implemented in hardware
  such as ASIC. However, implementation of these counters in hardware faces critical
  challenges: high memory consumption, control inflexibility, and low statistical
  accuracy. In this paper, we present the concept of Software Defined Hardware Counters
  (SDHC) for SDN, which offloads the management of counter updating to software and
  still maintains practical execution efficiency in hardware. Therefore, SDHC can
  allocate counter memory on demand to enhance counter utilization, which greatly
  reduces on-chip memory consumption. It is able to allow controllers to flexibly
  control the counters through south-bound interface. Besides, with novel statistics
  feedback mechanisms, SDHC supports high-accuracy and active statistical requirement
  applications. Through a prototype implementation and performance evaluation based
  on FPGA and general processor, we reveal that the proposed SDHC is able to achieve
  high processing performance and high statistical accuracy, which incurs negligible
  updating delay to the switches.'

ABS: The prevalence of big data technology has generated increasing demands in large-scale
  streaming data processing. However, for certain tasks it is still challenging to
  appropriately select a platform due to the diversity of choices and the complexity
  of configurations. This paper focuses on benchmarking some principal streaming platforms.
  We achieve our goals on StreamBench, a streaming benchmark tool based on which we
  introduce proper modifications and extensions. We then accomplish performance comparisons
  among different big data platforms, including Apache Spark, Apache Storm and Apache
  Samza. In terms of performance criteria, we consider both computational capability
  and fault-tolerance ability. Finally, we give a summary on some key knobs for performance
  tuning as well as on hardware utilization.

ABS: Net-flow fingerprint technique provides better efficiency in areas such as stepping
  stones detection and anonymous network correlation. Carrier capacity, robustness
  and invisibility are important indicators of net-flow fingerprint systems. In order
  to compare the efficiency of different net-flow fingerprint systems and help designing
  a more efficient system by finding capacity bounds and judging robustness and invisibility
  level, a net-flow fingerprint model based on optimization theory is proposed. Firstly,
  the proposed model covers all possible attack effects on net-flow fingerprint by
  reducing net-flow transformation problems to mergence, substitution and insertion,
  which improves the applicability of the model. Secondly, the proposed model establishes
  unified analysis criteria for robustness and invisibility, which, combined with
  different attack intensities, helps to divide robustness and invisibility into three
  levels, and then effectively and accurately measures them by goodness-of-fit test.
  What is more, the proposed model converts robustness, invisibility and net-flow
  transformation problems into different constraints. The maximum capacity under different
  conditions can be figured out by layered superposing corresponding constraints.
  Experimental results have confirmed the correctness, feasibility and expandability
  of the proposed model.

ABS: NetMemex explores efficient network traffic archival without any loss of information.
  Unlike NetFlow-like aggregation, NetMemex allows retrieving the entire packet data
  including full payload, which makes it useful in forensic analysis, networked and
  distributed system research, and network administration. Different from packet trace
  dumps, NetMemex performs sophisticated data compression for small storage space
  use and optimizes the data layout for fast query processing. NetMemex takes advantage
  of high-speed random access of flash drives and inexpensive storage space of hard
  disk drives. These efforts lead to a cost-effective yet high-performance full traffic
  archival system. We demonstrate that NetMemex can record full-fidelity traffic at
  near-Gbps rates using a single commodity machine, handling common queries at up
  to 90.1 K queries/second, at a low storage cost comparable to conventional hard
  disk-only traffic archival solutions.

ABS: We investigate network outages by systematically correlating inferred reboot
  events from probing the data plane with global routing events in the control plane.
  We introduce a correlation technique that can be used to strengthen inferences made
  about reboot events of IPv6 routers. We run correlation technique over two sets
  of inferred reboot event data and show how many reboot events correlate. We show
  the correlation can also be used to go in the other direction by inferring a reboot
  event took place inside a window based on global routing events and correlating
  it with an inferred reboot event from the data plane. Finally, we show that the
  technique used to infer reboot events of routers can also be used on other types
  of IPv6 infrastructure such as web servers and name servers.

ABS: This paper is about fitting a model for the spreading of a computer virus to
  measured data, contributing not only the fitted model, but equally important, an
  account of the process of getting there. Over the last years, there has been an
  increased interest in epidemic models to study the speed of virus spread. But parameterising
  such models is hard, because due to the unexpected nature of real outbreaks, there
  is not much solid measurement data available, and the data may often have imperfections.
  We propose a mean-field model for computer virus spread, and use parameter fitting
  techniques to set the models parameter values based on measured data. We discuss
  a number of steps that had to be taken to make the fitting work, including preprocessing
  and interpreting the measurement data, and restructuring the model based on the
  available data. We show that the resulting parameterised model closely mimics real
  system behaviour, with a relative squared error of 0.7%.

ABS: Botnets compose a major source of malicious activity over a network and their
  early identification and detection is considered as a top priority by security experts.
  The majority of botmasters rely heavily on a scan procedure in order to detect vulnerable
  hosts and establish their botnets via a command and control (C&amp;C) server. In
  this paper we examine the statistical characteristics of the scan process invoked
  by the Mariposa and Zeus botnets and demonstrate the applicability of conditional
  entropy as a robust metric for profiling it using real pre-captured operational
  data. Our analysis conducted on real datasets demonstrates that the distributional
  behaviour of conditional entropy for Mariposa and Zeus-related scan flows differs
  significantly from flows manifested by the commonly used NMAP scans. In contrast
  with the typically used by attackers Stealth and Connect NMAP scans, we show that
  consecutive scanning flows initiated by the C&amp;C servers of the examined botnets
  exhibit a high dependency between themselves in regards of their conditional entropy.
  Thus, we argue that the observation of such scan flows under our proposed scheme
  can sufficiently aid network security experts towards the adequate profiling and
  early identification of botnet activity.

ABS: Recent researches have stated the fast deployment of IPv6. It has been demonstrated
  that IPv6 grows much faster, being so more and more adopted by both Internet service
  providers but also by servers and end-hosts. In parallel, researches have been conducted
  to discover and assess the usage of MPLS tunnels. Indeed, recent developments in
  the ICMP protocol make certain categories of MPLS tunnels transparent to traceroute
  probing. However, these studies focus only on IPv4, where MPLS is strongly deployed.
  In this paper, we provide a first look at how MPLS is used under IPv6 networks using
  traceroute data collected by CAIDA. We have observed, at the first glance, that
  the MPLS deployment and usage seem to greatly differ between IPv4 and IPv6, in particular
  in the way MPLS label stacks are used. While label stacks are not that frequent
  in IPv4 (and mostly correspond to a VPN usage), they are prevalent in IPv6.  However,
  after a deeper look at the label stack typical content in IPv6, we understand that
  2-label stack tunnels are mainly used for dual stack 6PE tunnels and ECMP load sharing
  purpose.  The technical deployment of such tunnels is really similar to VPN in practice
  but the objective is not the same (they are standard tunnels made with the IPv4
  LDP for carrying IPv6 traffic).

ABS: IP traceback is a solution for attributing cyber attacks, and it is also useful
  for accounting user traffic and network diagnosis. Marking-based traceback (MBT)
  has been considered a promising traceback approach, and has received considerable
  attention. However, we find that the traceback message delivery problem in MBT,
  which is important to the successful completion of a traceback, has not been adequately
  studied in the literature. To address this issue, we present the design, analysis,
  and evaluation of opportunistic piggyback marking (OPM) for IP traceback in this
  paper. The OPM distinguishes itself from the existing works by decoupling the traceback
  message content encoding and delivery functions in MBT, and efficiently achieves
  expedited and robust traceback message delivery by exploiting piggyback marking
  opportunities. Based on the proposed OPM scheme, we then present the flexible marking-based
  traceback framework, which is a novel design paradigm for IP traceback and has several
  favorable features for practical deployment of IP traceback. Through the numerical
  analysis and the comprehensive simulation evaluations, we demonstrate that our design
  effectively reduces the traceback completion delay and router processing overhead,
  and increases the message delivery ratio compared with other baseline approaches.

ABS: The normalized Laplacian spectrum (NLS) is a powerful tool for comparing graphs
  with different sizes. Recently, we showed that two NLS features, namely the weighted
  spectral distribution (WSD) and the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 1 (ME1), are
  particularly relevant to the Internet topology at the inter-domain level. In this
  paper, we examine the physical meaning of the two metrics for the Internet. We show
  that the WSD reflects the transformation from single-homed nodes to multi-homed
  nodes for better fault-tolerance and that the ME1 quantifies the initial star-based
  structure associated with node classification, both of which are critical to the
  robustness of the Internet structure. We then investigate the relation between the
  metrics and graph perturbations (i.e., small changes in a graph). We show that these
  two NLS metrics can be a good choice for study on the Internet optimization. Our
  work reveals novel insights into the Internet structure and provides useful knowledge
  for statistical analysis on complex networks.

ABS: SSICLOPS is aiming at empowering enterprises to create and operate high-performance
  private cloud infrastructures that allow flexible scaling through federation with
  other private clouds without compromising their service level and security requirements.
  To that end, work packages 1 and 3 of the SSICLOPS project are tackling challenges
  related to improving data transport in a single datacenter (WP1) and workload distribution
  across multiple datacenters (WP3). This document is joint work between these two
  work packages and describes the results achieved in the SSICLOPS project during
  its first year. It constitutes deliverable D1.1, which includes the results related
  to private and federated cloud infrastructures. In its first year of operation,
  the SSICLOPS project has developed and investigated a number of ideas addressing
  challenges in multiple areas covering various parts of the end-to-end service delivery
  infrastructure. More specifically, SSICLOPS worked on (and continues to work on)
  the networking stack on endpoints, the protocols spoken between the endpoints, and
  the distribution of workload across the infrastructure. SSICLOPS has been developing
  improvements for all three categories and thus shows broad coverage of the end-to-end
  cloud infrastructure. In these domains, SSICLOPS has published six papers so far,
  with more being in the pipeline. One piece of software, namely mSwitch, has been
  released to the community as open source. Other pieces are expected to follow suit.
  Moreover, partners of the project consortium have contributed to five IETF drafts.
  Accordingly, the project has made good progress towards its objectives of providing
  improvements of private cloud infrastructure. Among the various achievements of
  the project, one highlight is the development of mSwitch, a high-performance software
  switch, which outperforms FreeBSDs bridge by up to eight times. Another highlight
  is TCP sendbuffer advertising, which has been shown to improve the average flow
  throughput by 5% to 15%. In the workload distribution domain, Hyrise-R adds scale-out
  capabilities to the in-memory data base Hyrise and makes the amount of processed
  read requests linearly scalable with the number of replicas. This deliverable reports
  on both published and (not yet published) ongoing work. For published work, the
  deliverable contains only a summary of the publication and the full publication
  is part of the appendices of this deliverable. Ongoing work is briefly summarized

ABS: Botnet is one of the most serious threats to cyber security as it provides a
  distributed platform for several illegal activities. Regardless of the availability
  of numerous methods proposed to detect botnets, still it is a challenging issue
  as botmasters are continuously improving bots to make them stealthier and evade
  detection. Most of the existing detection techniques cannot detect modern botnets
  in an early stage, or they are specific to command and control protocol and structures.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect botnets irrespective of their
  structures, based on network traffic flow behavior analysis and machine learning
  techniques. The experimental evaluation of the proposed method with real-world benchmark
  datasets shows the efficiency of the method. Also, the system is able to identify
  the new botnets with high detection accuracy and low false positive rate.

ABS: UDP flooding is one of the most pursued DDoS attack among the attackers. Extensive
  research solutions focused on other DDoS flooding attacks could be found, but little
  work to deal UDP flooding attack traffic exists. Due to the stateless nature of
  UDP, the detection of the attack is very difficult and can effectively throttle
  the victim with unwanted traffic. In this paper, we present a solution to detect
  UDP flooding attack based on generalized entropy information metric and also determine
  the malicious source IP (SIP) addresses by carrying out the attack. We conduct our
  experiment on some captured attack traffic and the results demonstrate that the
  proposed solution can effectively detect UDP flooding attack along with the malicious
  SIP addresses.

ABS: Counting Bloom filters (CBF) and their variants are data structures that support
  membership or multiplicity queries with a low probabilistic error. Yet, they incur
  a significant memory space overhead when compared to lower bounds as well as to
  (plain) Bloom filters, which can only represent set membership without removals.
  This work presents TinyTable, an efficient hash table based algorithm that supports
  membership queries, removals and multiplicity queries (statistics). TinyTable improves
  space efficiency by as much as 28% compared to CBF variants and as much as 60% for
  monitoring flow statistics. When the required false positive rate is smaller than
  1%, TinyTable is even slightly more space efficient than (plain) Bloom filters.
  Our performance study shows that TinyTable has acceptable runtime overheads.

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a major security threat for networks
  and Internet services. The complexity and frequency of occurrence of DDoS attacks
  are growing in parallel with rapid developments of the Internet and associated computer
  networks. A significant number of network security tools are available on the Internet
  to generate network attacks as well as to defend and analyze network attacks. Attackers
  can generate attack traffic similar to normal network traffic using sophisticated
  attacking tools. In such a situation, many defense solutions fail to identify DDoS
  attacks in real-time. DDoS attack traffic typically behaves differently from legitimate
  network traffic in terms of traffic features. Statistical properties of various
  features can be analyzed to distinguish the attack traffic from legitimate traffic.
  In this paper, we introduce a statistical measure called Feature Feature Score (FFSc)
  for multivariate data analysis to distinguish DDoS attack traffic from normal traffic.
  We extract three features of network traffic, viz., entropy of source IPs, variation
  of source IPs and packet rate to analyze the behavior of network traffic for attack
  detection. The method is validated using CAIDA DDoS 2007 and MIT DARPA datasets.

ABS: Many networks have properties that remain invariant over time, even when many
  vertices and edges are added and removed. One of such properties is the ranking
  stability of the most important vertices that can be obtained from network historical
  data. In this work, we analyze the degree ranking stability over time of scale-free
  networks based on techniques from prior works. Additionally, we propose an empirical
  analysis to evaluate the influence of external factors to the network structure.
  The purpose is to understand how the external and internal factors affect the temporal
  dynamics of the degree ranking, in order to predict the stability level when the
  same conditions are maintained. Results show that the scale-free degree distribution
  in the network make the top-ranked positions more stable and the variations occurred
  in these positions are predominantly caused by external factors. The stability of
  remaining positions are also affected by a noise formed by common degree variations
  in the network.

ABS: In recent years, flow-based anomaly detection has attracted considerable attention
  from many researchers and some methods have been proposed to improve its accuracy.
  However, only a few studies have considered anomaly detection with sampled flow
  traffic, which is widely used for the management of high-speed networks. This gap
  is addressed in this study. First, we optimize an artificial neural network (ANN)-based
  classifier to detect anomalies in flow traffic. The results show that although it
  has a high degree of accuracy, the classifier loses significant information in the
  process of sampling. In this regard, we propose a sampling method to improve the
  performance of flow-based anomaly detection in sampled traffic. While existing sampling
  methods for anomaly detection preserve only small malicious flows, the proposed
  algorithm samples both small and large malicious flows. Therefore, the detection
  rate of the flow-based anomaly detector is improved by about 5% using our algorithm.
  To evaluate the proposed sampling method, three flow-based datasets are generated
  in this study.

  these geometric correlations facilitate: (i) the definition and detection of multidimensional
  communities, which are sets of nodes that are simultaneously similar in multiple
  layers; (ii) accurate trans-layer link prediction, where connections in one layer
  can be predicted by observing the hidden geometric space of another layer; and (iii)
  efficient targeted navigation in the multilayer system using only local knowledge,
  which outperforms navigation in the single layers only if the geometric correlations
  are sufficiently strong. Our findings uncover fundamental organizing principles
  behind real multiplexes and can have important applications in diverse domains.'

ABS: In recent years, there have been numerous geographically localized disruptions
  in Internet connectivity, as a result of malicious or natural causes. Though Internet-wide
  vulnerabilities have been studied extensively, the robustness of metropolitan area
  networks is still not well understood. In this paper, we study structural properties
  and vulnerabilities in metropolitan area networks, and develop techniques to monitor
  failures by small detection sets. By combining geolocation techniques with traceroute
  based measurements, we collect a large data set for 12 of the 25 most populated
  metropolitan regions in the US. Our analysis reveals that the structure of these
  paths gives superior insights into the robustness of metropolitan area networks
  as compared to the topological structure of the graph induced by these paths, which
  has been traditionally studied.

ABS: Collaborative Anomaly Detection (CAD) is an emerging field of network security
  in both academia and industry. It has attracted a lot of attention, due to the limitations
  of traditional fortress-style defense modes. Even though a number of pioneer studies
  have been conducted in this area, few of them concern about the universality issue.
  This work focuses on two aspects of it. First, a unified collaborative detection
  framework is developed based on network virtualization technology. Its purpose is
  to provide a generic approach that can be applied to designing specific schemes
  for various application scenarios and objectives. Second, a general behavior perception
  model is proposed for the unified framework based on hidden Markov random field.
  Spatial Markovianity is introduced to model the spatial context of distributed network
  behavior and stochastic interaction among interconnected nodes. Algorithms are derived
  for parameter estimation, forward prediction, backward smooth, and the normality
  evaluation of both global network situation and local behavior. Numerical experiments
  using extensive simulations and several real datasets are presented to validate
  the proposed solution. Performance-related issues and comparison with related works
  are discussed.

ABS: Modern Internet has enabled wider usage, resulting in increased network traffic.
  Due to the high volume of data packets in networking, sampling techniques are widely
  used in flow-based network management software to manage traffic load. However,
  sampling processes reduce the likelihood of anomaly detection. Many studies have
  been carried out at improving the accuracy of anomaly detection. However, only a
  few studies have considered it with sampled flow traffic. In our study, we investigate
  the use of an artificial neural network (ANN)- based classifier to improve the accuracy
  of flow-based anomaly detection in sampled traffic. A feedback from the ANN-based
  anomaly detector determines the type of the flow sampling method that should be
  used. Our proposed technique handles malicious flows and benign flows with different
  sampling methods. To evaluate the proposed sampling technique, a number of flow-based
  datasets are generated. Our experiments confirm that the proposed technique improves
  the percentage of the sampled malicious flows by about 7% and it can preserve the
  majority of traffic information.

ABS: The reduction of the energy footprint of large and mid-sized IEEE 802.11 access
  networks is gaining momentum. When operating at the network management level, the
  availability of an accurate power model of the APs becomes of paramount importance,
  because different detail levels have a non-negligible impact on the performance
  of the optimisation algorithms. The literature is plentiful of AP power models,
  and choosing the right one is not an easy task. In this paper we report the outcome
  of a thorough study on the impact that various inflections of the AP power model
  have when minimising the energy consumption of the infrastructure side of an enterprise
  wireless LAN. Our study, performed on several network scenarios and for various
  device energy profiles, reveals that simple one- and two-component models can provide
  excellent results in practically all cases. Conversely, employing accurate and detailed
  power models rarely offers substantial advantages in terms of power reduction, but,
  on the other hand, makes the solving algorithms much slower to execute.

ABS: Network devices, meeting increasing workload demand, are not efficiently power-workload
  proportionate and consume a considerable amount of power even when the workload
  (utilisation) is low. This work proposes a novel Slowing Mechanism (SM) that provides
  Power Workload Proportionality for a wired network equipment to reduce power consumption.
  The Slowing will be achieved by adjusting the Operational Rate (OPR) of components
  according to traffic load. To meet applications (VoIP, Data and Video) performance
  requirements, a Safety Gap (SG) is proposed in the Slowing Mechanism. Many parameters
  need to be carefully set for performance requirements within Slowing Mechanism.
  A Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimisation dynamically set to respond to the variable
  incoming traffic pattern determines these parameters. Thus, this work is a GA and
  the Slowing Mechanism integration to provide an insight into how GA optimisation
  can be employed in a network environment, and to optimise parameters in real-time.
  The results demonstrate that a considerable amount of saving is achievable. With
  the default hardware configuration, the SM optimises the parameters and offers a
  saving of over 60% for typical stable traffic, with acceptable packet delay and
  no packet loss. This saving is reduced to 17% saving for a bursty traffic pattern
  with acceptable performance degradation.

ABS: The massive traffic volumes and the heterogeneity of services in todays networks
  urge for flexible, yet simple measurement solutions to assist network management
  tasks, without impairing network performance. To turn treatable tasks requiring
  traffic analysis, sampling the traffic has become mandatory, triggering substantial
  research in the area. In fact, multiple sampling techniques have been proposed to
  assist network engineering tasks, each one targeting specific measurement goals
  and traffic scenarios. Despite that, there is still a lack of an encompassing solution
  able to support the flexible deployment of these techniques in production networks.
  In this context, this research work proposes a modular traffic sampling architecture
  able to foster the flexible design and deployment of efficient measurement strategies.
  The architecture is composed of three layers i.e., management plane, control plane
  and data plane covering key components to achieve versatile and lightweight measurements
  in diverse traffic scenarios and measurement activities. The flexibility and modularity
  in deploying different sampling strategies relies upon a novel taxonomy of sampling
  techniques, in which, current and emerging techniques are identified regarding their
  inner characteristics - granularity, selection trigger and selection scheme. Following
  the proposed taxonomy, a sampling framework prototype has been developed and used
  as an experimental implementation of the proposed architecture, providing a fair
  environment to assess and compare sampling techniques under distinct measurement
  scenarios. Supported by the sampling framework, distinct techniques have been evaluated
  regarding their performance in balancing the computational burden and the accuracy
  in supporting traffic workload estimation and flow analysis. The results have demonstrated
  the relevance and applicability of the proposed architecture, revealing that a modular
  and configurable approach to sampling is a step forward for improving sampling scope
  and efficiency.

ABS: Anomaly detectors (ADs) are extremely effective in finding Zero Day attacks,
  so anomaly detection has become an important area for both academic researchers
  as well as commercial interests. While ADs are attractive conceptually, they suffered
  from low accurate and poor adaptability. In this paper, an algorithm to improve
  accuracy and automation of ADs based on self-correlation analysis are proposed for
  any given ADs. We first perform statistical and information-theoretic analyses of
  Ads anomaly scores to reveal a consistent self-correlation characteristic during
  benign and abnormal periods separately. We found that anomaly scores during benign
  periods can be modeled as a stochastic process to prove automation improvement and
  anomaly scores during abnormal periods can be modeled as another stochastic process.
  Therefore, we model anomaly scores as a random walk on one of two stochastic processes,
  corresponding respectively to the traffic patterns of benign and malware. The multi-windows
  correlation algorithm based on threshold random walk was proposed to prove accurate
  and automation improvement. The proposed accurate and adaptive algorithm is incorporated
  into five prominent ADs. These accurate and adaptive ADSs are evaluated on public
  and real-world traffic traces. We show that, while reducing the need for manual
  parameter configuration and having low-complexity, the proposed algorithm enables
  the ADs to achieve considerably higher accuracy.

ABS: Worm propagation models are important for understanding worm dynamics and designing
  effective and efficient detection and defence systems. The existing models, however,
  ignore the heterogeneity in vulnerable hosts and assume that the worm-scanning rate
  is the same for all infected hosts. In this work, we analytically and empirically
  study the impact of heterogeneity of vulnerable hosts on worm propagation. Specifically,
  we first apply the Jensens inequality to show that the heterogeneity in vulnerable
  hosts indeed hinders the speed of worm propagation. Next, we propose a novel model
  to predict and characterise worm dynamics among heterogeneous vulnerable hosts.
  Finally, applying the real trace from Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis
  (CAIDA) to simulate the propagation of a Witty worm in the Internet, we verify our
  analytical results and demonstrate that our proposed model can accurately predict
  the spread of worms among heterogeneous vulnerable hosts.

ABS: Using IP spoofing, a person masquerades as another by falsifying source IP address
  and gains an illegitimate access. Denial of Service (DoS) is an attack that is launched
  to bring down a network by flooding it with useless traffic. This attack can be
  easily exploited by IP spoofing. To prevent DoS, it is necessary to determine the
  source of the attacks. IP traceback is a mechanism that attempts to reconstruct
  the path traversed by a packet to find the real source. Two predominant traceback
  mechanisms are packet marking and logging. Packet marking records the path information
  of the intermediate routers in the packet, which can then be used to reconstruct
  the path. Packet logging logs the packets at the intermediate routers. Hybridizing
  these two methods gives the benefits of both. This paper refines a hybrid IP traceback
  method, Modulo and Reverse modulo and proposes a few changes in the way the packets
  are logged and tracked back. Revised-MORE uses subnet address to create hash values
  rather than source IP. This reduces the amount of packets to be logged at the routers.
  Time-To-Live is used for tracing exactly. The simulation results show that the refinements
  reduce logging overhead, storage requirements and improve traceback accuracy.

ABS: 'In this dissertation, we evaluate the potential of unsolicited Internet traffic,
  called Internet Background Radiation (IBR), to provide insights into address space
  usage and network conditions. IBR is primarily collected through darknets, which
  are blocks of IP addresses dedicated to collecting unsolicited traffic resulting
  from scans, backscatter, misconfigurations, and bugs. We expect these pervasively
  sourced components to yield visibility into networks that are hard to measure (e.g.,
  hosts behind firewalls or not appearing in logs) with traditional active and passive
  techniques. Using the largest collections of IBR available to academic researchers,
  we test this hypothesis by: (1) identifying the phenomena that induce many hosts
  to send IBR, (2) characterizing the factors that influence our visibility, including
  aspects of the traffic itself and measurement infrastructure, and (3) extracting
  insights from 11 diverse case studies, after excluding obvious cases of sender inauthenticity.
  Through IBR, we observe traffic from nearly every country, most ASes with routable
  prefixes, and millions of /24 blocks. Misconfigurations and bugs, often involving
  P2P networks, result in the widest coverage in terms of visible networks, though
  scanning traffic is applicable for in-depth and repeated analysis due to its large
  volume. We find, notwithstanding the extraordinary popularity of some IP addresses,
  similar observations using IBR collected in different darknets, and a predictable
  degradation using smaller darknets. Although the mix of IBR components evolves,
  our observations are consistent over time. Our case studies highlight the versatility
  of IBR and help establish guidelines for when researchers should consider using
  unsolicited traffic for opportunistic network analysis. Based on our experience,
  IBR may assist in: corroborating inferences made through other datasets (e.g., DHCP
  lease durations) supplementing current stateof-the art techniques (e.g., IPv4 address
  space utilization), exposing weaknesses in other datasets (e.g., missing router
  interfaces), identifying abused resources (e.g., open resolvers), testing Internet
  tools by acting as a diverse traffic sample (e.g., uptime heuristics), and reducing
  the number of required active probes (e.g., path change inferences). In nearly every
  case study, IBR improves our analysis of an Internet-wide behavior. We expect future
  studies to reap similar benefits by including IBR.'

ABS: A route in the Internet may take a longer AS path than the shortest AS path due
  to routing policies. In this paper, we systematically analyze AS paths and quantify
  the extent to which routing policies inflate AS paths. The results show that AS
  path inflation in the Internet is more prevalent than expected. We first present
  the extent of AS path inflation observed from the RouteView and RIPE routing tables.
  We then employ three common routing policies to show the extent of AS path inflation.
  We find that No-Valley routing policy causes the least AS path inflation among the
  three routing policies. PreferCustomer-and-Peer-over-Provider policy causes the
  most AS path inflation. In addition, we find that single-homed stub ASes experience
  more path inflations than transit ASes and multi-homed ASes. The AS pairs with shortest
  AS path of 3 AS hops experience more path inflations than other AS pairs. Finally,
  we investigate the AS path inflation on the end-to-end path from end users to two
  popular content providers, Google and Comcast. Although the majority of the shortest
  AS paths from end users to the two providers consists of no more than three AS hops,
  the actual end-to-end paths that the traffic will take are longer than the shortest
  AS paths in many cases. Quantifying AS path inflation in the Internet has important
  implications on the extent of routing policies, traffic engineering performed on
  the Internet, and BGP convergence speed.

ABS: 'Distributed systems play a critical role in peoples daily lives. They provide
  functions such as routing telephone calls, processing stock market transactions,
  and recording medical information. However, nodes in distributed systems can fail
  for many reasons: for instance, they can suffer a software or hardware failure,
  an operator can configure or operate nodes incorrectly, and an attacker can compromise
  nodes. These faults can stop the distributed system from working correctly, and
  they may lead to serious problems. Because of this, there is a need for efficient
  and effective ways to handle such faults. Accountability is an attractive way to
  detect faults in distributed systems. It works by detecting any incorrect behaviors
  of the node. More specifically, it can handle the most general class of faults called
  Byzantine faults. Other faults such as crash faults, rational faults are special
  cases of it. When faults are detected, accountability can provide irrefutable evidence
  to prove it. Moreover, it offers a provable guarantee that any faults that affect
  a correct node can be detected. However, previous accountability techniques are
  difficult to apply to distributed systems with incomplete information. In this dissertation,
  we study two specific instances of this problem: 1) cases where some nodes work
  with confidential data, and 2) cases that the actions of a node cannot be easily
  observed. An example of the former is the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) information
  exchanged between neighboring ISPs may allow inferences about confidential business
  contracts. An example of the later is a peer-assisted Content Distribution Network
  (CDN) client may be easily modified to submit fake downloading reports. Thus, new
  approaches are expected to provide accountability in these situations. My work deals
  with this situation by extending accountability in two ways: First, it proposes
  to replace the original approach to log checking (deterministic replay) with zero-knowledge
  techniques, i.e, it no longer tries to reconstruct a particular execution, but rather
  checks the property that actually matters for the purposes of auditing, that is,
  it checks whether there exists a correct execution that explains all the I/O. And
  second, it proposes to check potentially unreliable information with a combination
  of a) heuristics to find suspicious actions, and b) a safe, low-cost countermeasure
  that can be applied to suspicious nodes without adverse consequences, so it can
  be used even when the degree of confidence is low. In principle, the two solutions
  are orthogonal and could be combined in the same system. The thesis presents two
  separate solutions for the rest contribution, one application specific one that
  is highly efficient, and another that is general but more expensive. It shows the
  second contribution in the context of a concrete system, Akamai NetSession, but
  the approach generalizes to other system (as long as one can find other heuristics
  and another safe countermeasures). We apply the above techniques to BGP and to Akamai
  NetSession. Evaluations with real world data show that our system can provide accountability
  with incomplete information, and that the computation, bandwidth, and storage costs
  are reasonable.'

  massive content distribution and retrieval. A tree-based metric space T is proposed
  according to the concept of hierarchical division of symbol space. In Griffin, the
  network topology is embedded into the T -space, and content names are mapped to
  the T -space. Content publication and retrieval are supported by geometric routing
  in the T -space. Different from previous embedding schemes, Griffin constructs the
  T -space according to the network topology before embedding. In contrast to prior
  name resolution schemes, Griffin operates directly on the network topology without
  establishing an overlay. The correctness of Griffin is proved by the greediness
  of geometric routing. The experiments by simulation demonstrate that Griffin is
  efficient and scalable.

ABS: Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks aim at rapidly exhausting the communication
  and computational power of a network target by flooding it with large volumes of
  malicious traffic. In order to be effective, a DDoS defense mechanism should detect
  and mitigate threats quickly, while allowing legitimate users access to the attacks
  target. Nevertheless, defense mechanisms proposed in the literature tend not to
  address detection and mitigation challenges jointly, but rather focus solely on
  the detection or the mitigation facet. At the same time, they usually overlook the
  limitations of centralized defense frameworks that, when deployed physically close
  to a possible target, become ineffective if DDoS attacks are able to saturate the
  targets incoming links. This paper presents STONE, a framework with expert system
  functionality that provides effective and joint DDoS detection and mitigation. STONE
  characterizes regular network traffic of a service by aggregating it into common
  prefixes of IP addresses, and detecting attacks when the aggregated traffic deviates
  from the regular one. Upon detection of an attack, STONE allows traffic from known
  sources to access the service while discarding suspicious one. STONE relies on the
  data streaming processing paradigm in order to characterize and detect anomalies
  in real time. We implemented STONE on top of StreamCloud, an elastic and parallel-distributed
  stream processing engine. The evaluation, conducted on real network traces, shows
  that STONE detects DDoS attacks rapidly, provides minimal degradation of legitimate

ABS: In the last decade many works has been done on the Internet topology at router
  or autonomous system (AS) level. As routers is the essential composition of ASes
  while ASes dominate the behavior of their routers. It is no doubt that identifying
  the affiliation between routers and ASes can let us gain a deeper understanding
  on the topology. However, the existing methods that assign a router to an AS just
  based on the origin ASes of its IP addresses, which does not make full use of information
  in our hand. In this paper, we propose a methodology to assign routers to their
  owner ASes based on community discovery tech. First, we use the origin ASes information
  along with router-pairs similarities to construct a weighted router level topology,
  secondly, for enormous topology data (more than 2M nodes and 19M edges) from CAIDA
  ITDK project, we propose a fast hierarchy clustering which time and space complex
  are both linear to do ASes community discovery, last we do router-to-AS mapping
  based on these ASes communities. Experiments show that combining with ASes communities
  our methodology discovers, the best accuracy rate of router-to-AS mapping can reach
  to 82.62%, which is drastically high comparing to prior works that stagnate on 65.44%.

ABS: The DDoS attack is more vulnerable attack in the self structured and infra structure
  less MANET environment. The bot net based flooding attack is very cheap and easy
  to implement. Many detection and prevention mechanisms has been proposed to avoid
  DDoS attack. Here we have proposed the stochastic model of covariance matrix analysis
  in which the entropy difference has been computed by the frequency distribution
  of rule metrics against the threshold entropy periodically which in turn difference
  is highest can be controlled by reCAPTCHA controller to defend against DDoS attack.
  The prevention mechanism by trust evaluation using clustering methodology used to
  identify the attacker and reduce the cost of detection mechanism. The Aumann agreement
  theorem based trust re-evaluation is also proposed in order to reduce the false
  positive and negative probabilities, such that the accuracy of the system is enhanced.
  Finally the nodes identified as attacker by their trust values will be evicted and
  rekeying has been done. The experimental analysis in NS2 with CAIDA dataset shows
  true positive rate and detection rate is high in the proposed mechanism.

ABS: 'Given the rising threat of malware and the increasing inadequacy of signature-based
  solutions, online performance monitoring has emerged as a critical component of
  the security infrastructure of data centers and networked systems. Most of the systems
  that require monitoring are usually large-scale, highly dynamic and time-evolving.
  These facts add to the complexity of both monitoring and the underlying techniques
  for anomaly detection. Furthermore, one cannot ignore the costs associated with
  monitoring and detection which can interfere with the normal operation of a system
  and deplete the supply of resources available for the system. Therefore, securing
  modern systems calls for efficient monitoring strategies and anomaly detection techniques
  that can deal with massive data with high efficiency and report unusual events effectively.
  This dissertation contributes new algorithms and implementation strategies toward
  a significant improvement in the effectiveness and efficiency of two components
  of security infrastructure: (1) system monitoring and (2) anomaly detection. For
  system monitoring purposes, we develop two techniques which reduce the cost associated
  with information collection: i) a non-sampling technique and ii) a sampling technique.
  The non-sampling technique is based on compression and employs the best basis algorithm
  to automatically select the basis for compressing the data according to the structure
  of the data. The sampling technique improves upon compressive sampling, a recent
  signal processing technique for acquiring data at low cost. This enhances the technique
  of compressive sampling by employing it in an adaptive-rate model wherein the sampling
  rate for compressive sampling is adaptively tuned to the data being sampled. Our
  simulation results on measurements collected from a data center show that these
  two data collection techniques achieve small information loss with reduced monitoring
  cost. The best basis algorithm can select the basis in which the data is most concisely
  represented, allowing a reduced sample size for monitoring. The adaptive-rate model
  for compressive sampling allows us to save 70% in sample size, compared with the
  constant-rate model. For anomaly detection, this dissertation develops three techniques
  to allow efficient detection of anomalies. In the first technique, we exploit the
  properties maintained in the samples of compressive sampling and apply state-of-the-art
  anomaly detection techniques directly to compressed measurements. Simulation results
  show that the detection rate of abrupt changes using the compressed measurements
  is greater than 95% when the size of the measurements is only 18%. In our second
  approach, we characterize performance-related measurements as a stream of covariance
  matrices, one for each designated window of time, and then propose a new metric
  to quantify changes in the covariance matrices. The observed changes are then employed
  to infer anomalies in the system. In our third approach, anomalies in a system are
  detected using a low-complexity distributed algorithm when only steams of raw measurement
  vectors, one for each time window, are available and distributed among multiple
  locations. We apply our techniques on real network traffic data and show that these
  two techniques furnish existing methods with more details about the anomalous changes.'

ABS: 'Todays cybercriminals must carefully manage their network resources to evade
  detection and maintain profitable businesses. For example, a rogue online enterprise
  has to have multiple technical and business components in place, to provide the
  necessary infrastructure to keep the business available. Often, cybercriminals in
  their effort to protect and maintain their valuable network resources (infrastructures),
  they manipulate two fundamental Internet protocols; the Domain Name System (DNS)
  and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). A popular countermeasure against cybercriminal
  infrastructures are Autonomous Systems (AS) reputation systems. Past research efforts
  have developed several AS reputation systems that monitor the traffic for illicit
  activities. Unfortunately, these systems have severe limitations; (1) they cannot
  distinguish between malicious and legitimate but abused ASes, and thus it is not
  clear how to use them in practice, (2) require direct observation of malicious activity,
  from many different vantage points and for an extended period of time, thus delaying
  detection. This dissertation presents empirical studies and a system that help to
  counteract cybecriminal infrastructures. First, we perform empirical studies that
  help to advance our understanding, about how these infrastructures operate. We study
  two representative types of infrastructures: (1) fast-flux service networks which
  are infrastructures based on DNS manipulation, (b) malicious ASes (hubs of cybercriminal
  activities) which are infrastructures that are primarily based on BGP manipulation.
  Second, we build on our observations from these studies, and we design and implement,
  ASwatch; an AS reputation system that, unlike existing approaches, monitors exclusively
  the routing level behavior of ASes, to expose malicious ASes sooner. We build ASwatch
  based on the intuition that, in an attempt to evade possible detection and remediation
  efforts, malicious ASes exhibit agile routing behavior (e.g. short-lived routes,
  aggressive re-wiring). We evaluate ASwatch on known malicious ASes, and we compare
  its performance to a state of the art AS reputation system.'

ABS: Scalability is always a serious issue influencing the development of Software-Defined
  Network (SDN). Identifiers Separating and Mapping Architecture (ISMA) is a promising
  solution to the current Internet scaling problems by dividing the network into edge
  network and core network. In this paper, we adopt the idea of identity and locator
  splitting with SDN to aggregate flow table entries in the core network switches.
  Particularly we propose an approach of flow table entries compression in Open Flow
  network. We define an Open Flow based core forwarding element in core network and
  propose another coarse-grain forwarding flow table besides the fine-grain flow table
  to make flow table entries aggregation. Furthermore, we define another Open Flow
  based access forwarding element connecting the edge network and core network which
  has a mapping flow table inside. Then we design the prototype including forwarding
  elements and Open Flow controller with mapping module. Additionally, we compare
  the performance of our approach with individually applying Open Flow in the Internet,
  verify the feasibility and flow table entries compression effort using the prototype.
  The number of forwarding flow table entries in core network can be reduced dramatically.

ABS: The popularity of Tor as an anonymity system has made it a popular target for
  a variety of attacks. We focus on traffic correlation attacks, which are no longer
  solely in the realm of academic research with recent revelations about the NSA and
  GCHQ actively working to implement them in practice. Our first contribution is an
  empirical study that allows us to gain a high fidelity snapshot of the threat of
  traffic correlation attacks in the wild. We find that up to 40% of all circuits
  created by Tor are vulnerable to attacks by traffic correlation from Autonomous
  System (AS)-level adversaries, 42% from colluding AS-level adversaries, and 85%
  from statelevel adversaries. In addition, we find that in some regions (notably,
  China and Iran) there exist many cases where over 95% of all possible circuits are
  vulnerable to correlation attacks, emphasizing the need for AS-aware relay-selection.
  To mitigate the threat of such attacks, we build Astoria - an AS-aware Tor client.
  Astoria leverages recent developments in network measurement to perform path-prediction
  and intelligent relay selection. Astoria reduces the number of vulnerable circuits
  to 2% against AS-level adversaries, under 5% against colluding AS-level adversaries,
  and 25% against state-level adversaries. In addition, Astoria load balances across
  the Tor network so as to not overload any set of relays.

ABS: 'With the enormous growth of users reliance on the Internet, the need for secure
  and reliable computer networks also increases. Availability of effective automatic
  tools for carrying out different types of network attacks raises the need for effective
  intrusion detection systems. Generally, a comprehensive defence mechanism consists
  of three phases, namely, preparation, detection and reaction. In the preparation
  phase, network administrators aim to find and fix security vulnerabilities (e.g.,
  insecure protocol and vulnerable computer systems or firewalls), that can be exploited
  to launch attacks. Although the preparation phase increases the level of security
  in a network, this will never completely remove the threat of network attacks. A
  good security mechanism requires an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in order to
  monitor security breaches when the prevention schemes in the preparation phase are
  bypassed. To be able to react to network attacks as fast as possible, an automatic
  detection system is of paramount importance. The later an attack is detected, the
  less time network administrators have to update their signatures and reconfigure
  their detection and remediation systems. An IDS is a tool for monitoring the system
  with the aim of detecting and alerting intrusive activities in networks. These tools
  are classified into two major categories of signature-based and anomaly-based. A
  signature-based IDS stores the signature of known attacks in a database and discovers
  occurrences of attacks by monitoring and comparing each communication in the network
  against the database of signatures. On the other hand, mechanisms that deploy anomaly
  detection have a model of normal behaviour of system and any significant deviation
  from this model is reported as anomaly. This thesis aims at addressing the major
  issues in the process of developing signature based IDSs. These are: i) their dependency
  on experts to create signatures, ii) the complexity of their models, iii) the inflexibility
  of their models, and iv) their inability to adapt to the changes in the real environment
  and detect new attacks. To meet the requirements of a good IDS, computational intelligence
  methods have attracted considerable interest from the research community. This thesis
  explores a solution to automatically generate compact rulesets for network intrusion
  detection utilising evolutionary computation techniques. The proposed framework
  is called ESR-NID (Evolving Statistical Rulesets for Network Intrusion Detection).
  Using an interval-based structure, this method can be deployed for any continuous-valued
  input data. Therefore, by choosing appropriate statistical measures (i.e. continuous-valued
  features) of network trafc as the input to ESRNID, it can effectively detect varied
  types of attacks since it is not dependent on the signatures of network packets.
  In ESR-NID, several innovations in the genetic algorithm were developed to keep
  the ruleset small. A two-stage evaluation component in the evolutionary process
  takes the cooperation of rules into consideration and results into very compact,
  easily understood rulesets. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated against
  several sources of data for both detection of normal and abnormal behaviour. The
  results are found to be comparable to those achieved using other machine learning
  methods from both categories of GA-based and non-GA-based methods. One of the significant
  advantages of ESR-NIS is that it can be tailored to specific problem domains and
  the characteristics of the dataset by the use of different fitness and performance
  functions. This makes the system a more flexible model compared to other learning
  techniques. Additionally, an IDS must adapt itself to the changing environment with
  the least amount of configurations. ESR-NID uses an incremental learning approach
  as new flow of traffic become available. The incremental learning approach benefits
  from less required storage because it only keeps the generated rules in its database.
  This is in contrast to the infinitely growing size of repository of raw training
  data required for traditional learning.'

ABS: For more than 25 years now, traceroute has demonstrated its supremacy for network-path
  measurement, becoming the most widely used Internet path diagnosis tool today. A
  major limitation of traceroute when the destination is not controllable by the user
  is its inability to measure reverse paths, i.e., the path from a destination back
  to the source. Proposed techniques to address this issue rely on IP address spoofing,
  which might lead to security concerns. In this paper we introduce and evaluate DisNETPerf,
  a new tool for locating probes that are the closest to a distant server. Those probes
  are then used to collect data from the server point-of-view to the service user
  for path performance monitoring and troubleshooting purposes. We propose two techniques
  for probe location, and demonstrate that the reverse path can be measured with very
  high accuracy in certain scenarios.

  Therefore, forensics is vital for recovering from an attack but also to identify

  of an anomaly in the network. In this paper, we propose a method leveraging the
  Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm to passively identify switches composing
  the network path of an anomaly. As SDN technologies tend to be deployed in the next
  generation of networks including in data centers, they provide a helpful framework
  to implement our proposal without developing dedicated routers like usual IP traceback
  techniques. We evaluated our scheme with different network topologies (Internet
  and data centers) by considering distributed attacks with numerous hosts.

ABS: DDoS flooding attack is one of the top threats to the Internet. However, due
  to the fast development of the Internet, current detection algorithms are already
  inadequate to meet the growth of network traffic. In this paper, we propose a lightweight
  algorithm. We first observe the real Internet traffic, and find that flows of DDoS
  flooding attack traffic are persistent and synchronous while most flows of normal
  traffic are short-lived and non- synchronous. According to this difference, we propose
  our detection algorithm. We label the alarms firstly and then confirm the attack.
  Our algorithm is lightweight and sensitive to the ongoing attack. However, randomly
  spoofing the IP address of the attack source to different IP addresses can hide
  the synchronization of attack flows. Thus, we add a spoofing IP detection algorithm
  called hop-count filter (HCF) to our algorithm to strengthen the robustness. At
  last, we evaluate our detection algorithm based on the real Internet traffic from
  CAIDA. Results show that our detection algorithm has a high accuracy (93.3%), no
  false positive in attack confirmation and just 1.1% false positive rate in labeling
  alarms. In addition, we analyze the challenges we may face when dealing with distributed
  LDoS attack.

ABS: In recent years, flow-based anomaly detection has been used as a scalable method
  for high-speed networks. The application of supervised learning in flow-based anomaly
  detection has been considered in a number of studies. However, supervised methods
  are not very useful as they are only trained with labelled data. Therefore, in this
  study, we use a semi-supervised method to address the problem of the limitation
  of labelled data. S4VM is a semi-supervised method which can work with both labelled
  and unlabelled data. This method is used in this study to detect anomalies in flow
  traffic. The results show that S4VM has high accuracy when a large proportion of
  data is unlabelled. Although the accuracy of S4VM is slightly less than supervised
  learning, this method reduces the cost of labeling data, as only a small number
  of labelled flows are required. To evaluate the proposed anomaly detection method,
  a number of flow-based datasets are generated.

ABS: 'A Darknet is a passive sensor system that monitors traffic routed to unused
  IP address space. Darknets have been widely used as tools to detect malicious activities
  such as propagating worms, thanks to the useful feature that most packets observed
  by a darknet can be assumed to have originated from non-legitimate hosts. Recent
  commoditization of Internet-scale survey traffic originating from legitimate hosts
  could overwhelm the traffic that was originally supposed to be monitored with a
  darknet. Based on this observation, we posed the following research question: Can
  the Internet-scale survey traffic become noise when we analyze darknet traffic?
  To answer this question, we propose a novel framework, ID2, to increase the darkness
  of darknet traffic, i.e., ID2 discriminates between Internet-scale survey traffic
  originating from legitimate hosts and other traffic potentially associated with
  malicious activities. It leverages two inrinsic characteristics of Internet-scale
  survey traffic: a network-level property and some form of footprint explicitly indicated
  by surveyors. When we analyzed darknet traffic using ID2, we saw that Internet-scale
  traffic can be noise. We also demonstrated that the discrimination of survey traffic
  exposes hidden traffic anomalies, which are invisible without using our technique.'

ABS: Coordinated intrusion, like DDoS, Worm outbreak and Botnet, is a major threat
  to network security nowadays and will continue to be a threat in the future. To
  ensure the Internet security, effective detection and mitigation for such attacks
  are indispensable. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative intrusion prevention
  architecture, i.e. CIPA, aiming at confronting such coordinated intrusion behavior.
  CIPA is deployed as a virtual network of an artificial neural net over the substrate
  of networks. Taking advantage of the parallel and simple mathematical manipulation
  of neurons in a neural net, CIPA can disperse its lightweight computation power
  to the programmable switches of the substrate. Each programmable switch virtualizes
  one to several neurons. The whole neural net functions like an integrated IDS/IPS.
  This allows CIPA to detect distributed attacks on a global view. Meanwhile, it does
  not require high communication and computation overhead. It is scalable and robust.
  To validate CIPA, we have realized a prototype on Software-Defined Networks. We
  also conducted simulations and experiments. The results demonstrate that CIPA is
  effective.

  from a set of seed nodes. These diffusions are known to reveal small, localized
  clusters (or communities) and also large macro-scale clusters by varying a parameter
  that has a dual-interpretation as an accuracy bound and as a regularization level.
  We propose a new method that quickly approximates the result of the diffusion for
  all values of this parameter. Our method efficiently generates an approximate solution
  path or regularization path associated with a PageRank diffusion, and it reveals
  cluster structures at multiple size-scales between small and large. We formally
  prove a runtime bound on this method that is independent of the size of the network,
  and we investigate multiple optimizations to our method that can be more practical
  in some settings. We demonstrate that these methods identify refined clustering
  structure on a number of real-world networks with up to 2 billion edges.

ABS: Software-defined networks can enable a variety of concurrent, dynamically instantiated,
  measurement tasks, that provide fine-grain visibility into network traffic. Recently,
  there have  been  many  proposals  for  using  sketches  for  network measurement.  However,
  sketches in hardware switches use constrained resources such as SRAM memory, and
  the accuracy of measurement tasks is a function of the resources devoted to them
  on each switch. This paper presents SCREAM, a system for allocating resources to
  sketch-based measurement tasks that ensures a user-specified minimum accuracy. SCREAM
  estimates the instantaneous accuracy of tasks so as to dynamically adapt the allocated
  resources for each task. Thus, by finding the right amount of resources for each
  task on each switch and correctly merging sketches at the controller, SCREAM can
  multiplex resources among networkwide measurement tasks.  Simulations with three
  measurement tasks (heavy hitter, hierarchical heavy hitter, and super source/destination
  detection) show that SCREAM can support more measurement tasks with higher accuracy
  than existing approaches.

ABS: In this paper, we study the problem of mobile entities that synchronously have
  to explore and repair a graph with faulty nodes, usually called black-holes, that
  destroy any entering entity. We consider the scenario where the destruction of an
  entity by means of a black-hole also affects all the entities within a fixed range
  r (in terms of number of edges), while the black-hole disappears. Clearly, if there
  are b black-holes in the graph, then k ~ b entities are necessary to remove all
  of them from that graph. We ask for the minimum number of synchronous steps needed
  to make safe all the graph.The results of this paper are both theoretical and experimental,
  and can be summarized as follows. From the theoretical point of view, first we show
  that the problem is NP-hard even for b = k = 1 . Then, we provide a general lower
  bound holding when r ~ 0 and a higher one for the case of r 0 . We then consider
  the case of r ~ 1 . We propose an optimal solution holding when k is unbounded,
  that is, an infinite number of robots is available. Then, we provide three different
  exploration strategies, named snake, scout, and parallel-scout, respectively, for
  the case of bounded k, that is, the number of robots is fixed a priori. The three
  strategies are then analyzed according to the time complexity with respect to the
  lower bound. From the experimental point of view, we implemented the three strategies
  and tested them on different scenarios with the aim of assessing their practical
  performance. The experiments confirm the theoretical analysis and show that parallel-scout
  is always by far the best exploration strategy in practice.

ABS: Interdomain Multipath Routing, which allows an AS to transport packets to the
  same destination via different paths, is a promising technique for achieving high
  bandwidth, high resiliency and fast reaction to failures. However, previous Interdomain
  Multipath Routing algorithms often produce overlapped paths, thus are vulnerable
  to the failure of bottlenecks, and are also inefficient to support interdomain traffic
  engineering or concurrent multipath transfer. In this paper, we propose Disjoint
  Interdomain Multipath Routing (DIMR), which helps more ASes to discover two disjoint
  paths for each destination AS. The core idea of DIMR is a novel concept named path
  pair, which combines two disjoint or partly disjoint paths. We design the rules
  of path pair selection and build a theoretical model to formally prove the convergence
  of a network running DIMR. To fully utilize the disjoint paths, we also propose
  two packet forwarding approaches, both of which are guaranteed to be loop-free.
  Our simulation results show thatDIMR enables about 90% of multi-connected ASes to
  install two disjoint paths.

ABS: Operators of the Autonomous Systems (ASes) composing the Internet must deal with
  constant traffic growth, while striving to reduce the overall cost-per-bit and keep
  an acceptable quality of service. These challenges have motivated ASes to evolve
  their infrastructure from basic interconnectivity strategies, using a couple transit
  providers and a few settlement-free peers, to employ geographical scoped transit
  services (e.g. partial transit) and multiplying their peering efforts. Internet
  Exchange Points (IXPs), facilities allowing the establishment of sessions to multiple
  networks using the same infrastructure, have hence become central entities of the
  Internet. Although the benefits of a diverse interconnection strategy are manifold,
  it also encumbers the inter-domain Traffic Engineering process and potentially increases
  the effects of incompatible interests with neighboring ASes. To efficiently manage
  the inter-domain traffic under such challenges, operators should rely on monitoring
  systems and computer supported decisions. This thesis explores the IXP-centric inter-domain
  environment, the managing obstacles arising from it, and proposes mechanisms for
  operators to tackle them. The thesis is divided in two parts. The first part examines
  and measures the global characteristics of the inter-domain ecosystem. We characterize
  several IXPs around the world, comparing them in terms of their number of members
  and the properties of the traffic they exchange. After highlighting the problems
  arising from the member overlapping among IXPs, we introduce remote peering, an
  interconnection service that facilitates the connection to multiple IXPs. We describe
  this service and measure its adoption in the Internet. In the second part of the
  thesis, we take the position of the network operators. We detail the challenges
  surrounding the control of inter-domain traffic, and introduce an operational framework
  aimed at facilitating its management. Subsequently, we examine methods that peering
  coordinators and network engineers can use to plan their infrastructure investments,
  by quantifying the benefits of new interconnections. Finally, we delve into the
  effects of conflicting business objectives among ASes. These conflicts can result
  in traffic distributions that violate the (business) interests of one or more ASes.
  We describe these interest violations, differentiating their impact on the ingress
  and egress traffic of a single AS. Furthermore, we develop a warning system that
  operators can use to detect and rank them. We test our warning system using data
  from two real networks, where we discover a large number of interest violations.
  We thus stress the need for operators to identify the ones having a larger impact
  on their network.

ABS: With the advent of online services, the Internet has become extremely busy and
  demanding faster access. The increased dependency on the Internet obliges Internet
  service providers to make it reliable and secure. In this regard, researchers are
  tirelessly working on a number of technologies in order to ensure the continued
  viability of the Internet. Intrusion detection is one of the fields that enables
  secure operation of the Internet. An intrusion detection system (IDS) attempts to
  discover malicious activities in a network. However, with the increasing network
  throughput, IDSs should be able to analyse high volumes of traffic in real-time.
  Flow-based analysis is one of the methods capable of handling high-volume traffic.
  This method reduces the input traffic of IDSs because it analyses only packet headers.
  Flow-based anomaly detection can increase the reliability of the Internet, provided
  this method is functional at an early stage and complemented by packet-based IDSs
  at later stages. Employing artificial intelligence (AI) methods in IDSs provides
  the capability to detect attacks with better accuracy. Compared with typical IDSs,
  AI-based systems are more inclined towards detecting unknown attacks. This thesis
  proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) based flow anomaly detector optimised
  with metaheuristic algorithms. The proposed method is evaluated using a number of
  flow-based datasets generated. An ANN-based flow anomaly detection enables a high
  detection rate; hence, this thesis investigates this system more thoroughly. The
  ANN-based system is a supervised method which needs labelled datasets; however,
  labelling of a large amount of data found in high-speed networks is difficult. Semi-supervised
  methods are the combination of supervised and unsupervised methods, which can work
  with both labelled and unlabelled data. A semi-supervised method can provide a high
  detection rate even when there is a small proportion of labelled data; therefore,
  the application of this method in flow-based anomaly detection is considered.

ABS: 'There are currently no requirements (technical or otherwise) that BGP paths
  must be contained within national boundaries. Indeed, some paths experience international
  detours, i.e., originate in one country, cross international boundaries and return
  to the same country. In most cases these are sensible traffic engineering or peering
  decisions at ISPs that serve multiple countries. In some cases such detours may
  be suspicious. Characterizing international detours is useful to a number of players:
  (a) network engineers trying to diagnose persistent problems, (b) policy makers
  aiming at adhering to certain national communication policies, (c) entrepreneurs
  looking for opportunities to deploy new networks, or (d) privacy-conscious states
  trying to minimize the amount of internal communication traversing different jurisdictions.
  In this paper we characterize international detours in the Internet during the months
  of August 2014 and April 2015. To detect detours we sample BGP RIBs every 6 hours
  from 172 RouteViews peers spanning 22 countries; geolocate visible ASes by geolocating
  each BGP prefix announced by each AS; and analyze each global BGP RIB entry looking
  for detours. Our analysis shows more than 15K - 19K unique BGP prefixes experienced
  a detour. A few ASes cause most detours and a small fraction of prefixes were affected
  the most. We observe about 2 million detours in RIBs of each month. Detours either
  last for a few days or persist the entire month. Out of all the detours, more than
  50% - 60% were transient detours that lasted for 72 hours or less.'

ABS: The goal of this work is to enhance Internet security by applying formal analysis
  of traffic attraction attacks on the BGP routing protocol. BGP is the sole protocol
  used throughout the Internet for inter-domain routing, hence its importance. In
  attraction attacks an attacker sends false routing advertisements to gain attraction
  of extra traffic in order to increase its revenue from customers, drop, tamper,
  or snoop on the packets. Such attacks are most common on the inter-domain routing.
  We use model checking to perform exhaustive search for attraction attacks on BGP.
  This requires substantial reductions due to scalability issues of the entire Internet
  topology. Therefore, we propose static methods to identify and automatically reduce
  Internet fragments of interest, prior to using model checking. We developed a method,
  called BGP-SA, for BGP Security Analysis, which extracts and reduces fragments from
  the Internet. In order to apply model checking, we model the BGP protocol and also
  model an attacker with predefined capabilities. Our specifications allow to reveal
  different types of attraction attacks. Using a model checking tool we identify attacks
  as well as show that certain attraction scenarios are impossible on the Internet
  under the modeled attacker capabilities.

  alternative to BGPsec. Path-end validation is a modest extension to RPKI that does
  not require modifications to BGP message format nor online cryptography. Yet we

ABS: Software Defined Networking (SDN) separates the tightly coupled network control

  federation to improve the Internet routing flexibility. To achieve this goal, we
  propose a Multi-dimension Link Vector network view exchange mechanism (MLV) to exchange
  the fine-grained inter-domain routing information and enable programmable inter-domain
  routing. MLV can support flexible inter-domain routing control by exchanging multiple
  fields of the IP header. Based on MLV, innovations in inter-domain routing can be
  deployed as applications over SDN controllers. In order to validate the MLV design,
  we analyzed its performance with BGP-derived Internet AS topology. Finally, we implemented
  a prototype of MLV and tested it on an internationally collaborative inter-domain
  SDN testbed.

ABS: Recently, a botnet based DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, called
  target link flooding attack, has been reported that cuts off specific links over
  the Internet and disconnects a specific region from other regions. Detecting or
  mitigating the target link flooding attack is more difficult than legacy DDoS attack
  techniques, since attacking flows do not reach the target region. Although many
  mitigation schemes are proposed, they detect the attack after it occurs. In this
  paper, we propose a fast target link flooding attack detection scheme by leveraging
  the fact that the traceroute packets are increased before the attack caused by the
  attackers reconnaissance. Moreover, by analyzing the characteristic of the target
  link flooding attack that the number of traceroute packets simultaneously increases
  in various regions over the network, we propose a detection scheme with multiple
  detection servers to eliminate false alarms caused by sudden increase of traceroute
  packets sent by legitimate users. We show the effectiveness of our scheme by computer
  simulations.

ABS: Network management relies on an up-to-date and accurate view of many traffic
  metrics for tasks such as traffic engineering (e.g., heavy hitters), anomaly detection
  (e.g., entropy of source addresses), and security (e.g., DDoS detection). Obtaining
  an accurate estimate of these metrics while using little router CPU and memory is
  challenging. This in turn has inspired a large body of work in data streaming devoted
  to developing optimized algorithms for individual monitoring tasks, as well as recent
  approaches to make it simpler to implement these algorithms (e.g., OpenSketch).
  While this body of work has been seminal, we argue that this trajectory of crafting
  special purpose algorithms is untenable in the long term. We make a case for a RISC
  approach for flow monitoring analogous to a reduced instruction set in computer
  architecture--a simple and generic monitoring primitive from which a range of metrics
  can be computed with high accuracy. Building on recent theoretical advances in universal
  streaming, we show that this holy grail for flow monitoring might be well within
  our reach.

ABS: The recently proposed optical cut-through (OpCut) switch holds a great potential
  in achieving high energy efficiency, as it allows optical packets to cut through
  the switch in optical domain whenever possible, which avoids power-hungry O/E/O
  conversion. In the OpCut switch, to ensure in-order transmission, only optical Head-of-Line
  (HOL) packet of a switch flow, i.e., the stream of packets sharing the same input
  and output port, is allowed to cut-through the switch, and optical HOL packets are
  always prioritized over buffered HOL packets to achieve high cut-through ratio,
  which is measured by the portion of packets cutting through the switch optically.
  However, under such priority rule, switch flows with buffered packets are at the
  risk of starvation, and the OpCut switch fails to achieve 100 percent throughput
  for all admissible i.i.d. traffics due to the unfairness in packet scheduling. To
  address this two issues, in this paper we propose a delay threshold rule for packet
  scheduling, in which buffered packets with delays exceeding a preset delay threshold
  are prioritized over optical packets. In the meanwhile, the cut-through ratio is
  very low under heavily congested traffic due to maintaining packet order, whereas
  the Internet is designed to accommodate a certain degree of packet reorder, which
  is very common in practice due to path multiplicity. In this paper, we design a
  bounded-reorder packet scheduling algorithm that significantly increases the cut-through
  ratio of the OpCut switch while allowing a small degree of out-of-order transmission.
  Our extensive simulation results show that the energy efficiency of OpCut switch
  can be significantly improved with only a very small degree of packet reordering,
  which has little adverse impact on the network application performance.

ABS: Although some security threats were taken into consideration in the IPv6 design,
  DDoS attacks still exist in the IPv6 networks. The main difficulty to counter the
  DDoS attacks is to trace the source of such attacks, as the attackers often use
  spoofed source IP addresses to hide their identity. This makes the IP traceback
  schemes very relevant to the security of the IPv6 networks. Given that most of the
  current IP traceback approaches are based on the IPv4, they are not suitable to
  be applied directly on the IPv6 networks. In this research, a modified version of
  the Deterministic Flow Marking (DFM) approach for the IPv6 networks, called DFM6,
  is presented. DFM6 embeds a fingerprint in only one packet of each flow to identify
  the origin of the IPv6 traffic traversing through the network. DFM6 requires only
  a small amount of marked packets to complete the process of traceback with high
  traceback rate and no false positives.

GEOLOC: Philadelphia, PA, US
ABS: Anomalies in communication network traffic caused by malware or denial-of-service
  attacks manifest themselves in structural changes in the covariance matrix of traffic
  features. Real-time detection of anomalies in high-dimensional data demands a very
  efficient algorithm to identify these changes in a compact low-dimensional representation.
  This paper presents an efficient algorithm for the rapid detection of structural
  differences between two covariance matrices, as measured by the maximum possible
  angle between the subspaces specified by subsets of the two sets of principal components
  of the matrices. We show that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower computational
  complexity compared to a naive approach. Finally, we apply our results to real traffic
  traces from Internet backbone links and show that our approach offers a substantial
  reduction in the computational overhead of anomaly detection.

ABS: In order to compare the efficiency of different network watermarking systems
  and help designing a more efficient system by finding capacity bounds and judging
  robustness and invisibility level, a network watermarking model based on optimization
  theory is proposed. Firstly, it covers attack effects on network watermarking by
  inducing network transformation problems. Secondly, the proposed model establishes
  unified analysis criteria for robustness and invisibility, which helps to divide
  robustness and invisibility into three levels. Besides, combined with different
  attack intensities, it can effectively measure robustness and invisibility by goodness-to-fit
  test. Thirdly, the proposed model converts robustness, invisibility and network
  transformation problems into different constraints. Therefore, the maximum capacity
  under different conditions can be figured out by layered superposing corresponding
  constraints. At last, experimental results verifies the correctness and feasibility
  of the proposed model.

ABS: An essential component of a botnet is the Command and Control (C2) channel (a
  network). The mechanics of C2 establishment often involve the use of structured
  overlay techniques which create a scaffolding for sophisticated coordinated activities.
  However, it can also be used as a point of detection because of their distinct communication
  patterns. Achieving this is a needle-in-a-haystack search problem across distributed
  vantage points. The search technique must be efficient given the high traffic throughput
  of modern core routers. In this paper, we focus on efficient algorithms for C2 channel
  detection. Experimental results on real Internet traffic traces from an ISPs backbone
  network indicate that our techniques, (i) have time complexity linear in the volume
  of traffic, (ii) have high F-measure, and (iii) are robust to the partial visibility
  arising from partial deployment of monitoring systems, and measurement inaccuracies
  arising from partial visibility and dynamics of background traffic.

ABS: We introduce NetworKit, an open-source software package for analyzing the structure
  of large complex networks. Appropriate algorithmic solutions are required to handle
  increasingly common large graph data sets containing up to billions of connections.
  We describe the methodology applied to develop scalable solutions to network analysis
  problems, including techniques like parallelization, heuristics for computationally
  expensive problems, efficient data structures, and modular software architecture.
  Our goal for the software is to package results of our algorithm engineering efforts
  and put them into the hands of domain experts. NetworKit is implemented as a hybrid
  combining the kernels written in C++ with a Python front end, enabling integration
  into the Python ecosystem of tested tools for data analysis and scientific computing.
  The package provides a wide range of functionality (including common and novel analytics
  algorithms and graph generators) and does so via a convenient interface. In an experimental
  comparison with related software, NetworKit shows the best performance on a range
  of typical analysis tasks.

ABS: 'Cyberspace has become a massive battlefield between computer criminals and computer
  security experts. In addition, large-scale cyber attacks have enormously matured
  and became capable to generate, in a prompt manner, significant interruptions and
  damage to Internet resources and infrastructure. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
  are perhaps the most prominent and severe types of such large-scale cyber attacks.
  Furthermore, the existence of widely available encryption and anonymity techniques
  greatly increases the difficulty of the surveillance and investigation of cyber
  attacks. In this context, the availability of relevant cyber monitoring is of paramount
  importance. An effective approach to gather DoS cyber intelligence is to collect
  and analyze traffic destined to allocated, routable, yet unused Internet address
  space known as darknet. In this thesis, we leverage big darknet data to generate
  insights on various DoS events, namely, Distributed DoS (DDoS) and Distributed Reflection
  DoS (DRDoS) activities. First, we present a comprehensive survey of darknet. We
  primarily define and characterize darknet and indicate its alternative names. We
  further list other trap-based monitoring systems and compare them to darknet. In
  addition, we provide a taxonomy in relation to darknet technologies and identify
  research gaps that are related to three main darknet categories: deployment, traffic
  analysis, and visualization. Second, we characterize darknet data. Such information
  could generate indicators of cyber threat activity as well as provide in-depth understanding
  of the nature of its traffic. Particularly, we analyze darknet packets distribution,
  its used transport, network and application layer protocols and pinpoint its resolved
  domain names. Furthermore, we identify its IP classes and destination ports as well
  as geo-locate its source countries. We further investigate darknet-triggered threats.
  The aim is to explore darknet inferred threats and categorize their severities.
  Finally, we contribute by exploring the inter-correlation of such threats, by applying
  association rule mining techniques, to build threat association rules. Specifically,
  we generate clusters of threats that co-occur targeting a specific victim. Third,
  we propose a DDoS inference and forecasting model that aims at providing insights
  to organizations, security operators and emergency response teams during and after
  a DDoS attack. Specifically, this work strives to predict, within minutes, the attacks
  features, namely, intensity/rate (packets/sec) and size (estimated number of compromised
  machines/bots). The goal is to understand the future short-term trend of the ongoing
  DDoS attacks in terms of those features and thus provide the capability to recognize
  the current as well as future similar situations and hence appropriately respond
  to the threat. Further, our work aims at investigating DDoS campaigns by proposing
  a clustering approach to infer various victims targeted by the same campaign and
  predicting related features. To achieve our goal, our proposed approach leverages
  a number of time series and fluctuation analysis techniques, statistical methods
  and forecasting approaches. Fourth, we propose a novel approach to infer and characterize
  Internet-scale DRDoS attacks by leveraging the darknet space. Complementary to the
  pioneer work on inferring DDoS activities using darknet, this work shows that we
  can extract DoS activities without relying on backscattered analysis. The aim of
  this work is to extract cyber security intelligence related to DRDoS activities
  such as intensity, rate and geographic location in addition to various network-layer
  and flow-based insights. To achieve this task, the proposed approach exploits certain
  DDoS parameters to detect the attacks and the expectation maximization and k-means
  clustering techniques in an attempt to identify campaigns of DRDoS attacks. Finally,
  we conclude this work by providing some discussions and pinpointing some future
  work.'

ABS: Access to network traffic records is an integral part of recognizing and addressing
  network security breaches. Even with the increasing sophistication of network attacks,
  basic network events such as connections between two IP addresses play an important
  role in any network defense. Given the duration of current attacks, long-term data
  archival is critical but typically very little of the data is ever accessed. Previous
  work has provided tools and identified the need to trace connections. However, traditional
  databases raise performance concerns as they are optimized for querying rather than
  ingestion. The study of write-optimized data structures (WODS) is a new and growing
  field that provides a novel approach to traditional storage structures (e.g., B-trees).
  WODS trade minor degradations in query performance for significant gains in the
  ability to quickly insert more data elements, typically on the order of 10 to 100
  times more inserts per second. These efficient, out-of-memory data structures can
  play a critical role in enabling robust, long-term tracking of network events. In
  this paper, we present TWIAD, the Write-optimized IP Address Database. TWIAD uses
  a write-optimized B-tree known as a B_epsilon tree to track all IP address connections
  in a network traffic stream. Our initial implementation focuses on utilizing lower
  cost hardware, demonstrating that basic long-term tracking can be done without advanced
  equipment. We tested TWIAD on a modest desktop system and showed a sustained ingestion
  rate of about 20,000 inserts per second.

ABS: With the advancement of multicore servers, there is a new trend of moving network
  functions to software servers. Measurement is critical to most network functions
  as it not only helps the operators understand the network usage and detect anomalies,
  but also produces feedback to the control loop in management tasks such as load
  balancing and traffic engineering. Traditional researches on measurement algorithms
  mainly focus on reducing the memory usage leveraging the fact that measurement can
  sustain bounded inaccuracy. In this study, we re-evaluate these algorithms on software
  servers in order to understand their tradeoffs of accuracy and performance. We observe
  that simple hash tables work better than more advanced measurement algorithms for
  a variety of measurement scenarios. This is because with better cache design in
  modern servers and the skewness in the access patterns of measurement tasks, the
  memory usage of measurement tasks is largely irrelevant to the packet processing
  performance.

ABS: With the enormous growth of users reliance on the Internet, the need for secure
  and reliable computer networks also increases. A good security mechanism requires
  an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in order to monitor security breaches when the
  prevention schemes are circumvented. To be able to react to different network attacks
  in changing environments, a generic and flexible detection system is of paramount
  importance. This paper presents a method that uses statistical features as the input
  to a rule learning technique. First, for extracting suitable features for intrusion
  detection, an entropy and volume- based approach is introduced. Then, for the classification
  task, a genetic-based rule learning technique that utilises an interval-based representation
  for statistical features of network traffic is proposed. Two sources of data are
  used to evaluate this technique and to compare against other machine learning techniques.
  The results show that our proposed approach provides simple rulesets with competitive
  detection performance in comparison to other algorithms.

GEOLOC: New Brunswick, NJ, US
ABS: This thesis presents the design and evaluation of an edge-aware inter-domain
  routing (EIR) protocol for the MobilityFirst Future Internet Architecture. The EIR
  protocol provides enhanced inter-domain routing capabilities for wireless/mobile
  usage scenarios including wireless edge peering, dynamic network formation and mobility,
  multipath and multi-homing support. The EIR protocol design proposed here is based
  on abstractions of internal network topology and state of ASes in terms of aNodes
  and vLinks with this information being flooded through Network State Packets (nSPs)
  across the Internet. A technique called telescopic flooding in which nSP forwarding
  rates are reduced as a function of hop-distance from the originating node is introduced
  in order to control the overhead. These nSPs are used to construct the global network
  topology with some information about the structure and capabilities of each autonomous
  system(AS), making it possible to realize a variety of routing algorithms corresponding
  to the use cases mentioned earlier. Further, EIR is designed to work in conjunction
  with late binding of names to addresses and in-network storage in order to provide
  robust services in environments with dynamic mobility and disconnection. The proposed
  EIR protocol was validated through both large-scale simulations and ORBIT testbed
  emulations using the Click software framework implementation. The evaluations prove
  the feasibility of the protocol in terms of flooding overhead, convergence time
  and inter-domain forwarding table sizes. Also, evaluation of mobility service scenarios
  with migration of clients and networks across domains were performed and the results
  demonstrate the benefit of exposing the network state and the performance enhancements
  that can be achieved through the EIR protocol and related routing algorithms.

GEOLOC: Athens, GR
ABS: In this paper, we investigate the applicability of inserting an OpenFlow middlebox
  to enhance the remotely triggered black hole routing mechanism, to mitigate distributed
  denial of service (DDoS) attacks in legacy networks. Specifically, we propose a
  modular architecture that exploits the network programmability of software-defined
  networking within the context of network functions virtualization, deploying on-demand
  virtualized network functions (VNFs) capable to manipulate and filter malicious
  traffic. Leveraging on the OpenFlow control functionality, we match and handle traffic
  on a per-flow level, preserving connectivity to/from the victim while pushing the
  mitigation process upstream, towards the edge of the affected network. To that end,
  a multilevel anomaly detection and identification mechanism was developed, pinpointing
  the victim in case an attack is detected. Subsequently, a virtualized network function
  instructs the edge router to forward all traffic destined to the victim to an OpenFlow
  switch, acting as a middlebox capable to filter malicious traffic identified by
  an OpenFlow controller, while preserving benign flows. The proposed architecture
  was implemented and evaluated based on the combination of datasets containing traces
  of real DDoS attacks and normal background traffic from our university campus network.
  Our analysis illustrated a clear clustering of Internet protocol prefixes used by
  malicious sources; thus, we implemented a longest common prefix aggregation algorithm
  to enable scaling of the proposed mitigation process, overcoming constraints due
  to hardware limitations of OpenFlow devices. Our analysis verifies that the proposed
  modular and scalable schema can efficiently identify DDoS attack victims and filter
  malicious traffic, without exhausting system and network resources.

ABS: Mobile users Quality-of-Experience (QoE) is degrading as network usage increases
  while Internet Service Providers (ISP) face increased inter-domain traffic. This
  paper presents a network traffic management mechanism, named RBHORST, addressing
  these inefficiencies. RB-HORST exploits home routers by using them as caches and
  forming an overlay network between them to transfer content. To shift traffic from
  peak hours, RB-HORST employs predictions based on social network properties and
  based on similarity in the overlay network. To further improve user QoE, home routers
  allow trusted mobile devices to offload their mobile connection to the local WiFi.
  Simulation results show that an overlay is imperative for the success of the proposed
  caching mechanism. Especially ISPs with a large number of customers can benefit
  if only every thousandth user shares its router, reducing inter-domain traffic by
  half and superseding an ISP operated cache. The presented implementation proves
  that the concept is technically feasible and can be deployed and run on constrained
  devices.

ABS: Relying on services in the cloud involves manifold availability risks and concerns.
  This article focuses on the network reachability of cloud services. We present a
  study on cloud outages and causes, and analyze the topological connectivity of major
  cloud service providers (CSPs) by graph-based measures. Our approach is based on
  the construction and integration of an empirical dataset describing the connections
  between Autonomous Systems (ASs) of organizations that form the Internet backbone.
  According to our findings, though the ASs of CSPs generally appear to be better
  connected than an average AS, they also vastly differ in several connectivity measures,
  sometimes by more than an order of magnitude. Our results help to identify well-connected
  CSPs and CSPs that could potentially suffer more from Internet outages, if no additional
  path redundancy is provided. Our approach can be used by CSPs to assess connectivity
  beyond their own premises. It can also support cloud service customers during benchmarking
  and selection of CSPs when high availability is a critical requirement.

ABS: To facilitate content retrieval among NDN domains, a multipath inter-domain routing
  for named data networking (MIRNDN) was proposed. Under MIRNDN, an AS (autonomous
  system) maintained merely the routing state of content reachable from its own network
  or from its customers networks and aggregated routing information to mitigate routing
  scalability issue; valley free routing policy was applied to guide Interest packets
  that solicit content unreachable from the ASs own network nor from its customers
  networks to explore matching data packets via multiple paths, and NDNs requests
  aggregation, in-network caching and adaptive forwarding optimized such exploration;
  the reachability information of content from multiple paths was collected to support
  Interest multipath forwarding. The properties of FIB size and the convergence time
  and communication cost of routing update under MIRNDN were analyzed in theory. The
  experimental results in the AS level topology of current Internet validates that
  MIRNDN mitigates the scalability issue of NDN inter-domain routing, has relative
  short convergence time and moderate communication cost for routing update, and effectively
  reduces unnecessary Interest forwarding.

ABS: Commercial relationships between Autonomous Systems (ASes) regulate the inter-domain
  routing dynamics. Identifying these relationships and properly interpreting them
  can help understand inter-domain routing dynamics and explore routing anomalies
  where ASes are not following standard transit policies. Most studies in this domain
  use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) data to study inter-domain routing dynamics. In
  this study, we use IP-level topology data to complement these studies. More specifically,
  we use traceroute tool to collect end-to-end path traces. Then, we map our data
  to an AS-level topology map. We do this mainly by using the existing BGP based topology
  maps and AS-level neighborhood data to come up with several new heuristics to identify
  false AS-level links and missing AS hops in our dataset. In addition, we infer relationships
  for those AS-level links in our IP-level data that do not appear in the existing
  BGP based topology maps. We evaluate the accuracy of our heuristics by comparing
  their findings to that of the existing state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we
  use AS-level paths along with AS relationships dataset to infer potential inter-domain
  routing anomalies and classify them according to their suspected causes.

ABS: Grids and clouds are types of currently widely known distributed computing systems
  or DCSs. DCSs are complex systems in the sense that their emergent global behavior
  results from decentralized interaction of its parts and is not guided directly from
  a central point. In our study, we present a complex system model that efficiently
  manages the ressources of a DCS. The entities of the DCS react to system instability
  and adjust their environmental condtions for optimizing system performance. The
  structure of the interaction networks that allow fast and reliable access to available
  resources is studied and improvements ar proposed.

ABS: Our current understanding about the AS level topology of the Internet is based
  on measurements and inductive-type models which set up rules describing the behavior
  (node and edge dynamics) of the individual ASes and generalize the consequences
  of these individual actions for the complete AS ecosystem using induction. In this
  paper we suggest a third, deductive approach in which we have premises for the whole
  AS system and the consequences of these premises are determined through deductive
  reasoning. We show that such a deductive approach can give complementary insights
  into the topological properties of the AS graph. While inductive models can mostly
  reflect high level statistics (e.g. degree distribution, clustering, diameter),
  deductive reasoning can identify omnipresent subgraphs and peering likelihood. We
  also propose a model, called YEAS, incorporating our deductive analytical findings
  that produces topologies contain both traditional and novel metrics for the AS level
  Internet.

ABS: Bulletproof hosting Autonomous Systems (ASes)-malicious ASes fully dedicated
  to supporting cybercrime-provide freedom and resources for a cyber-criminal to operate.
  Their services include hosting a wide range of illegal content, botnet CC servers,
  and other malicious resources. Thousands of new ASes are registered every year,
  many of which are often used exclusively to facilitate cybercrime. A natural approach
  to squelching bulletproof hosting ASes is to develop a reputation system that can
  identify them for takedown by law enforcement and as input to other attack detection
  systems (e.g., spam filters, botnet detection systems). Unfortunately, current AS
  reputation systems rely primarily on data-plane monitoring of malicious activity
  from IP addresses (and thus can only detect malicious ASes after attacks are underway),
  and are not able to distinguish between malicious and legitimate but abused ASes.
  As a complement to these systems, in this paper, we explore a fundamentally different
  approach to establishing AS reputation. We present ASwatch, a system that identifies
  malicious ASes using exclusively the control-plane (i.e., routing) behavior of ASes.
  ASwatchs design is based on the intuition that, in an attempt to evade possible
  detection and remediation efforts, malicious ASes exhibit agile control plane behavior
  (e.g., short-lived routes, aggressive re-wiring). We evaluate our system on known
  malicious ASes; our results show that ASwatch detects up to 93% of malicious ASes
  with a 5% false positive rate, which is reasonable to effectively complement existing
  defense systems.

ABS: Route leaks have become an important security problem of inter-domain routing.
  Operators increasingly suffer from large-scale or small-scale route leak incidents
  in recent years. Route leaks can redirect traffic to unintended networks, which
  puts the traffic at risk of Man-in-the-Middle attack. Unlike other security threats
  such as prefix hijacking that advertises bogus BGP route, route leaks announce routes
  which are true but in violation of routing policies to BGP neighbors. Since the
  routing policies are usually kept confidential, detecting route leaks in the Internet
  is a challenging problem. In this paper, we reveal a link between routing loops
  and route leaks. We find that some route leaks may cause routing loops. Hence detecting
  routing loops is expected to be able to identify route leaks. We provide theoretical
  analysis to confirm the expectation, and further propose a detection mechanism which
  can identify the leaked route as well as the perpetrator AS. Our mechanism does
  not require information about routing policies. It passively monitors BGP routes
  to detect route leaks and hence it is lightweight and easy to deploy. The evaluation
  results show that our mechanism can detect a lot of route leaks that occur in the
  Internet per day.

ABS: Bloom filters are used in many computing and networking applications where they
  provide a simple method to test if an element is present in a set. In some of those
  systems, reliability is a major concern and therefore the Bloom filters should be
  protected to ensure that errors do not affect the system behavior. One of the most
  common type of errors in electronic implementations of Bloom filters are radiation
  induced soft errors. Soft errors can corrupt the contents of a Bloom filter causing
  false positives and false negatives. Error Correction Codes (ECCs) can be used to
  protect the Bloom filter so that for example single bit errors are detected and
  corrected. However, the use of ECCs impacts the implementation area, power and delay.
  In this paper, a method to efficiently protect the contents of a Bloom filter is
  presented. The scheme exploits the different effects at the system level of false
  positives and false negatives to achieve effective error protection at lower cost
  than that of a traditional ECC. To illustrate the benefits of the proposed method,
  a case study is presented where the proposed implementation is compared with the
  use of a traditional Hamming ECC.

ABS: Being able to exactly detect large network flows under an arbitrary time win-
  dow model is expected in many current and future applications like Denial- of-Service
  (DoS) flow detection, bandwidth guarantee, etc. However, to the best of our knowledge,
  there is no existing work that can achieve exact large flow detection without per-flow
  status. Maintaining per-flow status requires a large amount of expensive line-speed
  storage, thus it is not practical in real systems. Therefore, we proposed a novel
  model of an arbitrary time window with exactness outside an ambiguity region, which
  trades the level of exactness for scalability. Although some existing work also
  uses some techniques like sampling, multistage filters, etc. to make the system
  scal- able, most of them do not support the arbitrary time window model and they
  usually introduce a lot of false positives for legitimate flows. Inspired by a frequent
  item finding algorithm, we proposed Exact-outside-Ambiguity- Region Detector (EARDet),
  an arbitrary-window-based, efficient, simple, and no-per-flow-status large flow
  detector, which is exact outside an ambi- guity window defined by a high-bandwidth
  threshold and a low-bandwidth threshold. EARDet is able to catch all large flows
  violating the high- bandwidth threshold; meanwhile it protects all legitimate flows
  complying with the low-bandwidth threshold. Because EARDet focuses on flow clas-
  sification but not flow size estimation, it demonstrates amazing scalability such
  that we can fit the storage into on-chip Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) to achieve
  line-speed detection. To evaluate EARDet, we not only theoretically proved properties
  of EARDet above, but also evaluated them with real traffic, and the result perfectly
  supports our analysis.

ABS: This paper proposes a Scalable Internet Bandwidth Reservation Architecture (SIBRA)
  as a new approach against DDoS attacks, which, until now, continue to be a menace
  on todays Internet. SIBRA provides scalable inter-domain resource allocations and
  botnet-size independence, an important property to realize why previous defense
  approaches are insufficient. Botnet-size independence enables two end hosts to set
  up communication regardless of the size of distributed botnets in any Autonomous
  System in the Internet. SIBRA thus ends the arms race between DDoS attackers and
  defenders. Furthermore, SIBRA is based on purely stateless operations for reservation
  renewal, flow monitoring, and policing, resulting in highly efficient router operation,
  which is demonstrated with a full implementation. Finally, SIBRA supports Dynamic
  Interdomain Leased Lines (DILLs), offering new business opportunities for ISPs.

ABS: A testbed capable of representing detailed operations of complex applications
  under diverse network conditions is invaluable for understanding the design and
  performance of new protocols and applications before their real deployment. We introduce
  a novel method that combines high-performance large-scale network simulation and
  high-fidelity network emulation, and thus enables real instances of network applications
  and protocols to run in real operating environments and be tested under simulated
  network settings. Using our approach, network simulation and emulation can form
  a symbiotic relationship, through which they are synchronized for an accurate representation
  of the network-scale traffic behavior. We introduce a model downscaling method along
  with an efficient queuing model and a traffic reproduction technique, which can
  significantly reduce the synchronization overhead and improve accuracy. We validate
  our approach with extensive experiments via simulation and with a real-system implementation.
  We also present a case study using our approach to evaluate a multipath data transport
  protocol.

ABS: 'The high amount of small packets currently transported by IP networks results
  in a high overhead, caused by the significant header-to-payload ratio of these packets.
  In addition, the MAC layer of wireless technologies makes a non-optimal use of airtime

  This paper presents Simplemux, a protocol able to multiplex a number of packets
  sharing a common network path, thus increasing efficiency when small packets are
  transported. It can be useful in constrained scenarios where resources are scarce,
  as community wireless networks or IoT. Simplemux can be seen as an alternative to
  Layer-2 optimization, already available in 802.11 networks. The design of Simplemux
  is presented, and its efficiency improvement is analyzed. An implementation is used
  to carry out some tests with real traffic, showing significant improvements: 46%
  of the bandwidth can be saved when compressing voice traffic, the reduction in terms
  of packets per second in an Internet trace can be up to 50%. In wireless networks,
  packet grouping results in a significantly improved use of air time.'

ABS: Distributed-Denial-Of-Service attacks are one of the hardest security issues
  on the Internet today. One difficulty to counter these attacks is to trace the source
  of the attacks because they often use spoofed source IP addresses to hide their
  original source. This paper presents a new IP traceback scheme, called Probabilistic
  Flow Marking (PFM). The goal is to trace anonymous flooding attacks on the network
  back toward their original source, even if the source is located behind a network
  address translation (NAT) or a proxy device. In this approach, PFM embeds a fingerprint
  in the packets randomly. This enables PFM to identify the origin of the traffic
  traversing through the Internet on a per flow basis, regardless of the source IP
  address spoofing. We evaluate PFM on three real-life Internet data sets from the
  CAIDA archives. Our evaluation results show that compared to the previous IP traceback
  schemes, PFM significantly decreases the number of marked packets required to traceback
  and represents a step forward in terms of performance and deployability.

  a distributed monitoring system based on a new network tomography model. First,
  we present the model in which we can represent the network structure as a linear
  discrete time invariant dynamical system. Using this model, we define the concept
  of network structural observability and present an efficient algorithm to minimize
  the cardinality of the subset of monitoring sensors. As a case study, we use topological
  data from IPv6 Internet to present some properties of this minimum monitoring subset.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to (i) present general properties
  of sensors placement, (ii) use the proposed model to design distributed monitoring
  systems, and (iii) illustrate the feasibility of computer networks observability.
  Moreover, we believe that the theory of network structural observability presented

ABS: 'The transformation of the Internet from a client-server based paradigm to a
  content-based one has led to many of the fundamental network designs becoming outdated.
  The increase in user-generated contents, instant sharing, flash popularity, etc.,
  brings forward the needs for designing an Internet which is ready for these and
  can handle the needs of the small-scale content providers. The Internet, as of today,
  carries and stores a large amount of duplicate, redundant data, primarily due to
  a lack of duplication detection mechanisms and caching principles. This redundancy
  costs the network in different ways: it consumes energy from the network elements
  that need to process the extra data; it makes the network caches store duplicate
  data, thus causing the tail of the data distribution to be swapped out of the caches;
  and it causes the content-servers to be loaded more as they have to always serve
  the less popular contents. In this dissertation, we have analyzed the aforementioned
  phenomena and proposed several methods to reduce the redundancy of the network at
  a low cost. The proposals involve different approaches to do so--including data
  chunk level redundancy detection and elimination, rerouting-based caching mechanisms
  in information-centric networks, and energy-aware content distribution techniques.
  Using these approaches, we have demonstrated how we can perform redundancy elimination
  using a low overhead and low processing power. We have also demonstrated that by
  using local or global cooperation methods, we can increase the storage efficiency
  of the existing caches many-fold. In addition to that, this work shows that it is
  possible to reduce a sizable amount of traffic from the core network using collaborative
  content download mechanisms, while reducing client devices energy consumption simultaneously.'

ABS: Models of Internet routing are critical for studies of Internet security, reliability
  and evolution, which often rely on simulations of the Internets routing system.
  Accurate models are difficult to build and suffer from a dearth of ground truth
  data, as ISPs often treat their connectivity and routing policies as trade secrets.
  In this environment, researchers rely on a number of simplifying assumptions and
  models proposed over a decade ago, which are widely criticized for their inability
  to capture routing policies employed in practice. In this study we put Internet
  topologies and models under the microscope to understand where they fail to capture
  real routing behavior. We measure data plane paths from thousands of vantage points,
  located in eyeball networks around the globe, and find that between 14-35% of routing
  decisions are not explained by existing models. We then investigate these cases,
  and identify root causes such as selective prefix announcement, misclassification
  of undersea cables, and geographic constraints. Our work highlights the need for
  models that address such cases, and motivates the need for further investigation
  of evolving Internet connectivity.

ABS: Traffic Engineering (TE) is one of the keys for improving packet forwarding in
  the Internet. It allows IP network operators to finely tune their forwarding paths
  according to various customer needs. One of the most popular tool available today
  for optimizing the use of networking resources is MPLS. On the one hand, operators
  may use MPLS and label distribution mechanisms such as RSVP-TE in conjunction with
  BGP to define multiple transit paths (for a given edge pair) verifying different
  constraints on their network. On the other hand, when operators simply enable LDP
  for distributing MPLS labels in order to improve the scalability of their network,
  another kind of path diversity may appear thanks to the ECMP feature of IGP routing.
  In this paper, using an MPLS labels analysis, we demonstrate that it is possible
  to better understand the transit path diversity deployed within a given ISP. More
  specifically, we introduce the Label Pattern Recognition (LPR) algorithm, a method
  for analyzing traceroute data including MPLS information. LPR reveals the actual
  usage of MPLS according to the inferred label distribution protocol and is able
  to make the distinction between ECMP and TE multi-path forwarding. Based on an extensive
  and longitudinal traceroute dataset obtained from CAIDA, we apply LPR and find that
  each ISP behavior is really specific in regard to its MPLS usage. In particular,
  we are able to observe independently for each ISP the MPLS path diversity and usage,
  and its evolution over time. Globally speaking, the main outcomes of our study are
  that (i) the usage of MPLS has been increasing over the the last five years with
  basic encapsulation being predominant, (ii) path diversity is mainly provided thanks
  to ECMP and LDP, and, (iii), TE using MPLS is as common as MPLS without path diversity.

ABS: With the increasing demand of data communication in Internet and electronic commerce
  environments, security of the data is the prime concern. Large-scale collaborative
  wireless mobile ad hoc networks may face attacks and damages due to harsh behavior
  of the malicious nodes. To protect the systems from the intrusion of the attackers,
  security of the system has to be improvised. In researches involving the designing
  of the intrusion detection system (IDS), performance efficiency of the system is
  bound to be compromised. For an effective data communication process in the secured
  system, there is a need for better IDS without reducing the performance metrics.
  Intrusion detection is the progression of monitoring node movements and data transmission
  events that occur in a system for possible intrusions. Distributed denial of service
  (DDOS) attacks are the primary threat for security in the collaborative wireless
  Mobile Ad hoc networks. The attacks due to DDOS are much severe when compared to
  the non DDOS attacks. So proper preventive measures are necessary to detect and
  revoke such attacks. Our proposed approach involves trust-based evaluation wherein
  the intrusion detection is done using secured trust evaluation policies. In this
  paper, a novel IDS is designed using the trust evaluation metrics. This is used
  for the detection of the flooding DDOS attacks in the networked architecture. The
  proposed system combines the existing Firecol-based security procedures with Dynamic
  Growing Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm in the trust evaluation-based environment.
  Simulation results show that the Trust-based IDS is found to be better in terms
  of Security metrics viz. Detection probability and Performance metrics viz. Packet
  Data Ratio, Average Delay, Throughput and Energy Consumption.

ABS: Interdependent network models are often used to show how one network has an effect
  on another network through dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel interdependent
  network model which consists of two individual networks with unequal numbers of
  nodes and one-to-multiple weighted dependency links between the two networks. Based
  on realistic assumptions, this model differs from previous works that considered
  equal numbers of nodes in the two networks and identical dependency links. We formulate
  an optimization problem to allocate dependency links using least resources. This
  novel model enhances the practicability of traditional cyber-physical system structures,
  but it makes the dependency link deployment problem more complex and the optimization
  problem cannot be solved in large networks. To overcome this problem, we propose
  a new algorithm based on a revised network flow method. Extensive simulations on
  random networks and real networks show that our deployment method produces topologies
  that are more robust than the ones obtained by other deployment techniques. Results
  indicate that our algorithm is efficient and cost-effective in designing robust
  interdependent networks, and our deployment method is suitable for networks of any
  size.

  Enabling accurately detection of Distribute Denial-of-Service attacks is important

  on the distribution difference of the packet size between normal traffic flows and
  attack traffic flows and propose an entropy-based detection measurement. The measurement
  can highlights the characteristics of attack traffic. The experimental results show

ABS: For all purposes and intents, being able to infer the topology of a network is
  crucial to both operators and adversaries alike. Traceroute is a common active probing
  technique but it may be subverted by deceptive responses. We identify possible inconsistencies
  in traceroute deception systems, and endeavor to find potential deception in the
  historic IPv4 Routed /24 Topology Dataset from the Center for Applied Internet Data
  Analysis (CAIDA). Our results show three major patterns in 2013 and 2014 that exhibited
  instances of inconsistencies matching the techniques in our methodology. In addition
  to analyzing the historic dataset, we evaluate three cases of traceroute manipulation
  in the wild. These case studies include The Pirate Bay (TPB) server supposedly residing
  in North Korea, the Star Wars- and Christmas Carol-themed gags involving customized
  Domain Name System (DNS) names, and the experimental DeTracer at the Naval Postgraduate
  School (NPS). In the TPB case, we discovered extensive and long-running deception
  in the /24 subnet. We find intriguing patterns in the gag traceroutes and fake topologies
  from the DeTracer for which we may use to improve our filtering process. In all,
  the findings will aid future operations in verifying inferred network topologies

ABS: IP spoofing is prevalently used in DDoS attacks for anonymity and amplification,
  making them harder to prevent. Combating spoofing attacks requires the collaboration
  of different autonomous systems (ASes). Existing methods either lack flexibility
  in collaboration or require centralized control in the inter-AS environment. In
  this paper, we propose a Distributed Collaboration System (DISCS) for inter-AS spoofing
  defense, which allows ASes to flexibly collaborate in spoofing defense in a distributed
  manner. Each DISCS-enabled AS implements four defense functions. When a victim AS
  is under a spoofing attack, it can request other ASes to execute the most appropriate
  defense functions. We present the distributed and flexible control plane design
  and the backward compatible and incrementally deployable data plane design for both
  IPv4 and IPv6. We evaluate DISCS with theoretical proof and simulations using real
  Internet data. The results show that DISCS has strong deployment incentives, high
  effectiveness, minimal false positives, modest resource consumption and strong security.

TOPKEY: topology-ark-itdk
ABS: In the modern technological world, with the increasing dependency on Internet
  the security threats are on the rise. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack
  is one of the biggest threats. The attackers tend to exhaust the network resources,
  while ingeniously hiding their identity, making the defense process extremely difficult.
  Many researchers have proposed various solutions to traceback the true origin of
  attack. Among them Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) traceback was considered
  an industry standard by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). ICMP Traceback (ITrace)
  does not require any change in the existing infrastructure. However it consumes
  considerable bandwidth and requires a large number of packets to traceback an attacker.
  This work proposes a Single Packet ICMP Traceback technique using Router Interface
  (SPITRI). It traces the origin of flooding attack with a single ICMP packet. The
  bandwidth overhead incurred by SPITRI is several times lesser than ITrace. SPITRI
  was simulated over the CAIDA Ark dataset. It can traceback the attackers with high
  accuracy, with zero false positive and zero false negative result. The efficacy
  of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by simulating and comparing it with ITrace,
  and the latest router interface based single packet traceback scheme.

ABS: With the assignment of the last available blocks of public IPv4 addresses from
  Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, there is continued pressure for widespread
  IPv6 adoption. Because the IPv6 address space is orders of magnitude larger than
  the IPv4 address space, researchers need new methods and techniques to accurately
  measure and characterize growth in IPv6. This thesis focuses on IPv6 router infrastructure
  and examines the possibility of using heuristic methods in order to discover IPv6
  router interfaces. We consider two heuristic techniques in an attempt to improve
  upon current state-of-the-art IPv6 router infrastructure discovery methods. The
  first heuristic examines the ability to generate candidate IPv6 addresses by finding
  the most common lower 64 bit patterns among IPv6 router interface address observed
  in historical probing data. The second heuristic generates candidate IPv6 addresses
  by assuming that an IPv6 address seen in historical probing data is one end of a
  point-to-point link, and uses the corresponding ends IPv6 address. Using a distributed
  active topology measurement system, we test these heuristic methods on the IPv6
  Internet. We find that our first heuristic is successful in discovering a non-trivial
  number of new router interfaces, while the second heuristic is more efficient.

ABS: Link dimensioning is used by network operators to properly provision the capacity
  of their network links. Proposed methods for link dimensioning often require statistics,
  such as traffic variance, that need to be calculated from packet-level measurements.
  In practice, due to increasing traffic volume, operators deploy packet sampling
  techniques aiming to reduce the burden of traffic monitoring, but little is known
  about how link dimensioning is affected by such measurements. In this paper, we
  make use of a previously proposed and validated dimensioning formula that requires
  traffic variance to estimate required link capacity. We assess the impact of three
  packet sampling techniques on link dimensioning, namely, Bernoulli, n-in-N and sFlow
  sampling. To account for the additional variance introduced by the sampling algorithms,
  we propose approaches to better estimate traffic variance from sampled data according
  to the employed technique. Results show that, depending on sampling rate and link
  load, packet sampling does not negatively impact on link dimensioning accuracy even
  at very short timescales such as 10 ms. Moreover, we also show that the loss of
  inter-arrival time of sampled packets due to the exporting process in sFlow does
  not harm the estimations, given that an appropriate sampling rate is used. Our study
  is validated using a large dataset consisting of traffic packet traces captured
  at several locations around the globe.

ABS: We consider the problem of identifying global iceberg attacks in massive and
  physically distributed streams. A global iceberg is a distributed denial of service
  attack, where some elements globally recur many times across the distributed streams,
  but locally, they do not appear as a deny of service. A natural solution to defend
  against global iceberg attacks is to rely on multiple routers that locally scan
  their network traffic, and regularly provide monitoring information to a server
  in charge of collecting and aggregating all the monitored information. Any relevant
  solution to this problem must minimise the communication between the routers and
  the coordinator, and the space required by each node to analyse its stream. We propose
  a distributed algorithm that tracks global icebergs on the fly with guaranteed error
  bounds, limited memory and processing requirements. We present a thorough analysis
  of our algorithm performance. In particular we derive a tight upper bound on the
  number of bits communicated between the multiple routers and the coordinator in
  presence of an oblivious adversary. Finally, we present the main results of the
  experiments we have run on a cluster of single-board computers. Those experiments
  confirm the efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm to track global icebergs hidden
  in very large input data streams exhibiting different shapes.

ABS: Estimating the frequency of any piece of information in large-scale distributed
  data streams became of utmost importance in the last decade (e.g., in the context
  of network monitoring, big data, etc.). If some elegant solutions have been proposed
  recently, their approximation is computed from the inception of the stream. In a
  runtime distributed context, one would prefer to gather information only about the
  recent past. This may be led by the need to save resources or by the fact that recent
  information is more relevant. In this paper, we consider the sliding window model
  and propose two different (on-line) algorithms that approximate the items frequency
  in the active window. More precisely, we determine a (epsilon,delta)-additive-approximation
  meaning that the error is greater than epsilon only with probability delta. These
  solutions use a very small amount of memory with respect to the size N of the window
  and the number n of distinct items of the stream, namely, O(1/epsilon log 1/delta
  (logN+logn)) and O( 1/(tau epsilon) log 1/delta (logN+logn)) bits of space, where
  tau is a parameter limiting memory usage. We also provide their distributed variant,
  i.e., considering the sliding window functional monitoring model. We compared the
  proposed algorithms to each other and also to the state of the art through extensive
  experiments on synthetic traces and real data sets that validate the robustness
  and accuracy of our algorithms.

ABS: We introduce and explore a method for inferring hidden geometric coordinates
  of nodes in complex networks based on the number of common neighbors between the
  nodes. We compare this approach to the HyperMap method, which is based only on the
  connections (and disconnections) between the nodes, i.e., on the links that the
  nodes have (or do not have). We find that for high degree nodes, the common-neighbors
  approach yields a more accurate inference than the link-based method, unless heuristic
  periodic adjustments (or correction steps) are used in the latter. The common-neighbors
  approach is computationally intensive, requiring O(t4) running time to map a network
  of t nodes, versus O(t3) in the link-based method. But we also develop a hybrid
  method with O(t3) running time, which combines the common-neighbors and link-based
  approaches, and we explore a heuristic that reduces its running time further to
  O(t2), without significant reduction in the mapping accuracy. We apply this method
  to the autonomous systems (ASs) Internet, and we reveal how soft communities of
  ASs evolve over time in the similarity space. We further demonstrate the methods
  predictive power by forecasting future links between ASs. Taken altogether, our
  results advance our understanding of how to efficiently and accurately map real
  networks to their latent geometric spaces, which is an important necessary step
  toward understanding the laws that govern the dynamics of nodes in these spaces,
  and the fine-grained dynamics of network connections.

ABS: Security threats against computer networks and the Internet have emerged as a
  major and increasing area of concern for end-users trying to protect their valuable
  information and resources from intrusive attacks. Due to the amount of data to be
  analysed and the similarities between attack and normal traffic patterns, intrusion
  detection is considered a complex real world problem. In this paper, we propose
  a solution that uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a set of simple, interval-based
  rules based on statistical, continuous-valued input data. Several innovations in
  the genetic algorithm work to keep the ruleset small. We first tune the proposed
  system using a synthetic data. We then evaluate our system against more complex
  synthetic data with characteristics associated with network intrusions, the NSL-KDD
  benchmark dataset, and another dataset constructed based on MIT Lincoln Laboratory
  normal traffic and the low-rate DDoS attack scenario from CAIDA. This new approach
  provides a very compact set of simple, human-readable rules with strongly competitive
  detection performance in comparison to other machine learning techniques.

ABS: 'During the past decade, there has been significant interest in bottom-up evolutionary
  complex systems, such as the Internet, smart transportation systems and social product
  development. Compared with hierarchically-designed systems such as automotive and
  aircraft, the architectures of such complex systems are not under the direct control
  of designers, but emerge in a bottom-up manner based on decisions made by individual
  entities. The design strategy for bottom-up evolutionary complex systems is to influence
  agents behavior at the micro-level in order to indirectly achieve the requirements
  and desired performance at the system-level. To this end, the research objective
  of this dissertation is to establish a framework to model, analyze and estimate
  the micro-level decision-making behaviors for facilitating complex systems engineering
  and design. Existing studies have provided insights on modeling micro-level behaviors
  and understanding their effects on system-level performance. However, there is a
  lack of theoretical foundations for explaining why agents behaviors are modeled
  according to the rationality assumptions and whether or not such assumptions are
  appropriate. In other words, existing studies are primarily focused on the outcomes
  of decision-making (micro-level behavior) instead of the reasons for those decisions
  (decision-making preferences). There is a research gap in understanding the effects
  of agents decision making preferences on system structure and dynamics. To address
  this research gap, a decision-centric framework is proposed in this dissertation.
  This framework provides theoretical foundations for explaining agents rational behavior,
  establishes a link xix between decision-making preferences and the micro-level behaviors,
  and builds the relationship between agents preferences and system-level performance.
  Towards establishing the decision-centric framework, three research questions regarding
  modeling, analyzing and estimating micro-level behavior are addressed. The approaches
  proposed for answering the questions are validated using two applications examples:
  the Internet and social product development. In the case of the Internet, an approach
  based on discrete choice random utility theory integrated with complex network analysis
  is proposed to obtain micro-level behavioral models. The primary outcome is a generic
  decision-centric approach for modeling the evolution of complex systems. In the
  case of social product development, by integrating game theory and behavioral experimentation,
  a rigorous framework is established for modeling the decision-making behaviors of
  individuals in crowdsourcing competitions, and understanding its effects on the
  design outcomes. The overall contribution in this dissertation is a decision-centric
  framework to support bottom-up engineering and design of complex systems. The approaches
  established in this dissertation support the attainment of new knowledge on modeling,
  analysis and estimation of micro-level behaviors in complex systems. The results
  presented in this dissertation provide insights on directing the design of incentives
  and mechanisms to influence agents interactions at the micro-level to achieve desired
  system-level performance in complex networked systems, and to improve the crowdsourcing
  process for better design outcomes.'

ABS: Denial of Service (DoS) is a hot topic phenomenon lately. The intensity of DoS
  attacks increasing every day with the discovery of a new attack with the same type
  which is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). Both, attack the victims by flooding
  a lot of packet to the traffic channels at a time. This makes the flow of packets
  to the victims becomes choked and victim do not get the desired package because
  the density of traffic on its network. Traffic anomaly based is a good technique
  to detect DDoS attack. Traffic anomaly can be used by several method. One of them
  is self-similarity. Self-Similarity methods is suitable to the network traffic behaviour.
  Self-Similarity is a scale of invariant which always have the same. Today, self-similarity
  has been a dominant framework for modelling network traffic. It will show a plot
  of the traffic will have in common, even though it has a different time. For the
  result we use kolmogorv-smirnov to differentiate the anomaly and normal condition
  in each step of self-similarity. In normal condition Kolmogorov-smirnov test always
  give 0 and for anomaly condition give 1 for each step. 0 means that data were analysed
  didnt have a large difference. Otherwise data have a large difference. Hurst estimator
  provide 0,645 for normal condition. For anomaly condition, hurst estimator provide
  1,443. This is compatible with previous research which states that the hurst exponent
  from nomal traffic will provide value between 0,5<;H<;1. And the anomaly traffic
  is outside the range.

ABS: The Gromov hyperbolicity is an important parameter for analyzing complex networks
  which expresses how the metric structure of a network looks like a tree. It is for
  instance used to provide bounds on the expected stretch of greedy-routing algorithms
  in Internet-like graphs. However, the best-known theoretical algorithm computing
  this parameter runs in O(n3.69) time, which is prohibitive for large-scale graphs.
  In this article, we propose an algorithm for determining the hyperbolicity of graphs
  with tens of thousands of nodes. Its running time depends on the distribution of
  distances and on the actual value of the hyperbolicity. Although its worst case
  runtime is O(n4), it is in practice much faster than previous proposals as observed
  in our experimentations. Finally, we propose a heuristic algorithm that can be used
  on graphs with millions of nodes. Our algorithms are all evaluated on benchmark
  instances.

ABS: Large content providers, such as Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft, aim to directly
  connect with consumer networks and place the content closer to end users. Exchanging
  traffic directly between end users and content providers can reduce the cost of
  transit services. However, direct connection to all end users is simply not feasible.
  Content providers by-and-large still rely on transit services to reach the majority
  of end users. We argue that routing policies are an important factor in considering
  the selection of ISPs for content providers. Therefore, determining which ISP to
  peer or use as a transit becomes a key question for content providers. In this paper,
  we formulate the policy-aware peering problem, in which we determine not only which
  ISP to connect with, but also the kind of peering agreement to establish. We prove
  that such a policy-aware peering problem is NP-complete, and propose a heuristic
  algorithm to solve the problem. Further, we perform a large-scale measurement study
  of the peering characteristics of five large content providers, and evaluate the
  existing peering connections deployed by the content providers. Our measurement
  results show that changing the existing peering agreements or adding as little as
  3-5 new peering connections can enhance the connection between content providers
  and end users significantly.

GEOLOC: Hong Kong, CN
ABS: How many links can be cut before a network is bisected? What is the maximal bandwidth
  that can be pushed between two nodes of a network? These questions are closely related
  to network resilience, path choice for multipath routing or bisection bandwidth
  estimations in data centers. The answer is quantified using metrics such as the
  number of edge-disjoint paths between two network nodes and the cumulative bandwidth
  that can flow over these paths. In practice though, such calculations are far from
  simple due to the restrictive effect of network policies on path selection. Policies
  are set by network administrators to conform to service level agreements, protect
  valuable resources or optimize network performance. In this work, we introduce a
  general methodology for estimating lower and upper bounds for the policy-compliant
  path diversity and bisection bandwidth between two nodes of a network, effectively
  quantifying the effect of policies on these metrics. Exact values can be obtained
  if certain conditions hold. The approach is based on regular languages and can be
  applied in a variety of use cases.

ABS: Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and OpenFlow (OF) protocol have brought a promising
  architecture for the future networks. However, the centralized control and programmable
  characteristics also bring a lot of security challenges. Distributed denial-of-service
  (DDoS) attack is still a security threat to SDN. To detect the DDoS attack in SDN,
  many researches collect the flow tables from the switch and do the anomaly detection
  in the controller. But in the large scale network, the collecting process burdens
  the communication overload between the switches and the controller. Sampling technology
  may relieve this overload, but it brings a new tradeoff between sampling rate and
  detection accuracy. In this paper, we first extend a copy of the packet number counter
  of the flow entry in the OpenFlow table. Based on the flow-based nature of SDN,
  we design a flow statistics process in the switch. Then, we propose an entropy-based
  lightweight DDoS flooding attack detection model running in the OF edge switch.
  This achieves a distributed anomaly detection in SDN and reduces the flow collection
  overload to the controller. We also give the detailed algorithm which has a small
  calculation overload and can be easily implemented in SDN software or programmable
  switch, such as Open vSwitch and NetFPGA. The experimental results show that our
  detection mechanism can detect the attack quickly and achieve a high detection accuracy
  with a low false positive rate.

ABS: Network functions are widely deployed in modern networks, providing various network
  services ranging from intrusion detection to HTTP caching. Various virtual network
  function instances can be consolidated into one physical middlebox. Depending on
  the type of services, packet processing for different flows consumes different hardware
  resources in the middlebox. Previous solutions of multi-resource packet scheduling
  suffer from high computational complexity and memory cost for packet buffering and
  scheduling, especially when the number of flows is large. In this paper, we design
  a novel low-complexity and space-efficient packet scheduling algorithm called Myopia,
  which supports multi-resource environments such as network function virtualization.
  Myopia is developed based upon the fact that most Internet traffic is contributed
  by a small fraction of elephant flows. Myopia schedules elephant flows with precise
  control and treats mice flows using FIFO, to achieve simplicity of packet buffering
  and scheduling. We will demonstrate, via theoretical analysis, prototype implementation,
  and simulations, that Myopia achieves multi-resource fairness at low cost with short
  packet delay.

ABS: The past decade has seen many proposals for future Internet architectures. Most
  of these proposals require substantial changes to the current networking infrastructure
  and enduser devices, resulting in a failure to move from theory to real-world deployment.
  This paper describes one possible strategy for bootstrapping the initial deployment
  of future Internet architectures by focusing on providing high availability as an
  incentive for early adopters. Through largescale simulation and real-world implementation,
  we show that with only a small number of adopting ISPs, customers can obtain high
  availability guarantees. We discuss design, implementation, and evaluation of an
  availability device that allows customers to bridge into the future Internet architecture
  without modifications to their existing infrastructure.

ABS: Based on solid theoretical foundations, we present strong evidence that a number
  of real-world networks, taken from different domains (such as Internet measurements,
  biological data, web graphs, and social and collaboration networks) exhibit tree-like
  structures from a metric point of view. We investigate a few graph parameters, namely,
  the tree-distortion and the tree-stretch, the tree-length and the tree-breadth,
  Gromovs hyperbolicity, the cluster-diameter and the cluster-radius in a layering
  partition of a graph; such parameters capture and quantify this phenomenon of being
  metrically close to a tree. By bringing all those parameters together, we provide
  efficient means for detecting such metric tree-like structures in large-scale networks.
  We also show how such structures can be used. For example, they are helpful in efficient
  and compact encoding of approximate distance and almost shortest path information
  and in quick and accurate estimation of diameters and radii of those networks. Estimating
  the diameter and estimating the radius of a graph (or distances between arbitrary
  vertices) are fundamental primitives in many network and graph mining algorithms.

ABS: Internet scale DoS attack is a new evolution of conventional flooding DoS attack
  with the inspiration of shutting down the Internet due to its vulnerable infrastructure.
  Past DoS attacks directly attacked the victim, usually a single host. Consequently,
  defences were designed to identify the excessive traffic or filter illegitimate
  traffic. From the early two thousand, Internet scale DoS attacks started to appear.
  They aimed to disable highly connected routers or large links with a legitimate
  action in the form of low-rate traffic or high-rate wanted traffic with protocol
  messages that are unfiltered by congestion control. The latter can be more devastating
  due to its global impact therefore attracts the attention of researchers and some
  applications are now available. The goal of this paper is to introduce Internet
  scale DoS attack and to survey its theoretical underpinnings and experimental applications.
  Several attacking techniques will be presented, as well as their effects on the
  connectivity of the Internet. A comparison will be carried out among them to expose
  their pros and cons in order to study the possibility of their integration via usage
  of several botnets for destroying the Internet connectivity. Our discussion aims
  to clarify new directions that DoS, DoS defence and Internet design research can
  follow.

ABS: Many long-running network analytics applications (e.g., flow size estimation
  and heavy traffic detection) impose a high-throughput and high reliability requirements
  on stream processing systems. However, previous stream processing systems which
  are designed for higher layer applications cannot sustain high-speed traffic at
  the core router level. Furthermore, due to the nondeterministic nature of message
  passing among workers, the fault-tolerant schemes of previous streaming architectures
  based on the continuous operator model cannot provide strong consistency which is
  essential for network analytics. In this paper, we present the design and implementation
  of SAND, a fault-tolerant distributed stream processing system for network analytics.
  SAND is designed to operate under high-speed network traffic, and it uses a novel
  checkpointing protocol which can perform failure recovery based on upstream backup
  and checkpointing. We prove our fault-tolerant scheme provides strong consistency
  even under multiple node failure. We implement several real-world network analytics
  applications on SAND, including heavy traffic hitter detection as well as policy
  and charging control for cellular networks, and we evaluate their performance using
  network traffic captured from commercial cellular core networks. We demonstrate
  that SAND can sustain high-speed network traffic and that our fault-tolerant scheme
  is efficient.

ABS: 'It is important to understand to what extent, and in what perspectives, cyber
  attacks can be predicted. Despite its evident importance, this problem was not investigated
  until very recently, when we proposed using the innovative methodology of gray-box
  prediction. This methodology advocates the use of gray-box models, which accommodate
  the statistical properties/phenomena exhibited by the data. Specifically, we showed
  that gray-box models that accommodate the long-range dependence phenomenon can predict
  the attack rate (i.e., the number of attacks per unit time) 1-h ahead-of-time with
  an accuracy of 70.2%-82.1%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result
  showing the feasibility of prediction in this domain. We observe that the prediction
  errors are partly caused by the models incapability in predicting the large attack
  rates, which are called extreme values in statistics. This motivates us to analyze
  the extreme-value phenomenon, using two complementary approaches: 1) the extreme
  value theory (EVT) and 2) the time series theory (TST). In this paper, we show that
  EVT can offer long-term predictions (e.g., 24-h ahead-of-time), while gray-box TST
  models can predict attack rates 1-h ahead-of-time with an accuracy of 86%-87.9%.
  We explore connections between the two approaches, and point out future research
  directions. Although our prediction study is based on specific cyber attack data,
  our methodology can be equally applied to analyze any cyber attack data of its kind.'

ABS: Users demands have dramatically increased due to widespread availability of broadband
  access and new Internet avenues for accessing, sharing and working with information.
  In response, operators have upgraded their infrastructures to survive in a market
  as mature as the current Internet. This has meant that most network processing tasks
  (e.g., routing, anomaly detection, monitoring) must deal with challenging rates,
  challenges traditionally accomplished by specialized hardware-e.g., FPGA. However,
  such approaches lack either flexibility or extensibility-or both. As an alternative,
  the research community has proposed the utilization of commodity hardware providing
  flexible and extensible cost-aware solutions, thus entailing lower operational and
  capital expenditure investments. In this scenario, we explain how the arrival of
  commodity packet engines has revolutionized the development of traffic processing
  tasks. Thanks to the optimization of both NIC drivers and standard network stacks
  and by exploiting concepts such as parallelism and memory affinity, impressive packet
  capture rates can be achieved in hardware valued at a few thousand dollars. This
  tutorial explains the foundation of this new paradigm, i.e., the knowledge required
  to capture packets at multi-Gb/s rates on commodity hardware. Furthermore, we thoroughly
  explain and empirically compare current proposals, and importantly explain how apply
  such proposals with a number of code examples. Finally, we review successful use
  cases of applications developed over these novel engines.

ABS: 'The Internet is composed of routing devices connected between them and organized

  functions. Classical methods are severely affected by resolution limits and by the
  heterogeneity of the communities; even when using multiresolution methods, there
  is no single resolution at which most of the communities can be captured. However,
  we show that multiresolution methods do find the community structure of the Autonomous
  Systems, but each of them has to be observed at the correct resolution level. Then
  we develop a low-complexity multiresolution modularity optimization algorithm that
  finds communities at different resolution levels in a continuous scale, in one single
  run. Using this method, we show that with a scarce knowledge of the node affiliations,
  multiresolution methods can be adjusted to retrieve the Autonomous Systems, significantly
  improving the results of classical single-resolution methods. Finally, in the light
  of our results, we discuss recent work concerning the use of a priori information
  to find community structure in complex networks.'

ABS: The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) was designed almost three decades ago and has
  many limitations relating to its fully distributed nature, policy enforcement capabilities,
  scalability, security and complexity. For example, the control plane can take several
  minutes to converge after a routing change; this may be unacceptable for real-time
  network services. Despite many research proposals for incremental improvements and
  clean-slate redesigns of how inter-domain routing should work, BGP is likely one
  of the most ossified protocols of the Internet architecture and it has not retrofitted
  the proposed ideas. In this work, we propose a radical, incrementally deployable
  Internet routing paradigm in which the control plane of multiple networks is logically
  centralized. This follows the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm, although
  at the inter-domain level involving multiple Autonomous Systems (AS). Multi-domain
  SDN centralization can be realized by outsourcing routing functions to an external
  contractor, which provides inter-domain routing services facilitated through a multiAS
  network controller. The proposed model promises to become a vehicle for evolving
  BGP and uses the birds eye view over several networks to benefit aspects of inter-domain
  routing, such as convergence properties, policy conflict resolution, inter-domain
  troubleshooting, and collaborative security. In addition to the proposed paradigm,
  we introduce a publicly available emulation platform built on top of Mininet and
  the Quagga routing software, for experimenting on hybrid BGP-SDN AS-level networks.
  As a proof of concept, we focus specifically on exploiting multi-domain centralization
  to improve BGPs slow convergence. We build and make publicly available a first multi-AS
  controller tailored to this use case and demonstrate experimentally that SDN centralization
  helps to linearly reduce BGP convergence times and churn rates with expanding SDN
  deployments.

ABS: Name resolution is at the heart of Information-Centric Networking (ICN), where
  names are used to both identify information and/or services, and to guide routing
  and forwarding inside the network. The ICN focus on information, rather than hosts,
  raises significant concerns regarding the scalability of the required Name Resolution
  System (NRS), especially when considering global scale, inter-domain deployments.
  In the route-by-name approach to NRS construction, name resolution and the corresponding
  state follow the routing infrastructure of the underlying inter-domain network.
  The scalability of the resulting NRS is therefore strongly related to the topological
  and routing characteristics of the network. However, past work has largely neglected
  this aspect. In this paper, we present a detailed investigation and comparison of
  the scalability properties of two route-by-name inter-domain NRS designs, namely,
  DONA and CURLING. Based on both real, full-scale inter-domain topology traces and
  synthetic, scaled-down topologies, our work quantifies a series of important scalability-related
  performance aspects, including the distribution of name-resolution state across
  the Internet topology and the associated processing and signaling overheads. We
  show that by avoiding DONAs exchange of state across peering links, CURLING results
  in deployment costs proportional to the total number of downstream customers of
  each Autonomous System. This translates to a 62-fold global state size reduction,
  at the expense of a 2.78-fold increase in lookup processing load, making CURLING
  a feasible approach to ICN name resolution.

ABS: A new paradigm of scalable routing for ICN is to combine a geometric routing
  scheme with a Distributed Hash Table. However, for most routing schemes in this
  paradigm, when a node joins or leaves, large numbers of nodes, even the whole topology,
  need to be re-embedded, and a great number of contents need to be re-registered.
  In this paper, we propose D-Griffin, a geometric routing scheme on flat names for
  dynamic topologies. D-Griffin provides two advantages. First, it avoids re-embedding
  the topology by using an online greedy embedding scheme and a void handling greedy
  forwarding scheme. Second, it decreases the number of re-registrations by using
  a name mapping scheme with a tradeoff between topology independence and load balancing.
  Theoretical and experimental analyses show that D-Griffin provides guaranteed content
  lookup, low description complexity, low path stretch, scalable routing update, and
  acceptable load balancing.

ABS: A dynamic graph algorithm is called batch if it is able to update efficiently
  the solution of a given graph problem after multiple updates at a time (i.e., a
  batch) take place on the input graph. In this article, we study batch algorithms
  for maintaining a single-source shortest-path tree in graphs with positive real
  edge weights. In particular, we focus our attention on homogeneous batches, that
  is, either incremental (containing only edge insertion and weight decrease operations)
  or decremental (containing only edge deletion and weight increase operations) batches,
  which model realistic dynamic scenarios like transient vertex failures in communication
  networks and traffic congestion/decongestion phenomena in road networks. We propose
  two new algorithms to process either incremental or decremental batches, respectively,
  and a combination of these two algorithms that is able to process arbitrary sequences
  of incremental and decremental batches. All these algorithms are update sensitive;
  namely, they are efficient with respect to the number of vertices in the shortest-path
  tree that change their parents and/or their distances from the source as a consequence
  of a batch. This makes unfeasible an effective comparison on a theoretical basis
  of our new algorithms with the solutions known in the literature, which in turn
  are analyzed with respect to others and different parameters. For this reason, in
  order to evaluate the quality of our approach, we provide also an extensive experimental
  study including our new algorithms and the most efficient previous batch algorithms.
  Our experimental results complement previous studies and show that the various solutions
  can be consistently ranked on the basis of the type of homogeneous batch and of
  the underlying network. As a result, our work can be helpful in selecting a proper
  solution depending on the specific application scenario.

ABS: A denial of service (DoS) attack is the most common attack against the data availability
  on internet. It is an attempt to make a computer resource unavailable to its intended
  users. A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple attack
  sources collaborate to achieve this goal. Flooding attacks are the most prominent
  class of (D)DoS attacks. During a flooding DoS attack, attacking hosts are sending
  a huge volume of unsolicited network traffic to the victim, which results in the
  victim being overwhelmed. While most attention of both academia and industry is
  given to the analysis of large-scale volumetric DoS attacks, statistics have shown
  that more than 80% of DoS attacks worldwide have bandwidth less than 1 Gbps. These
  low power attacks can be executed by botnets, standalone DoS tools or DDoS-for-hire
  services (also DDoS as a service, DDoSaaS). This dissertation provides a comprehensive
  analysis of the threat posed by standalone DoS tools and widely available DDoSaaSs.
  Also, a framework for DoS attacks augmentation is presented. In case of botnets,
  outgoing DoS attacks recognition can be used for behavioral detection of malware-infected
  hosts. We explore both the founding ideas and the state-of-the-art research on host-based
  intrusion detection systems (HIDSs). Separate sections are devoted to the protection
  against tampering and to the HIDS evasion techniques that are employed by attackers.
  Existing research trends are highlighted, and possible future directions are suggested.
  Research on denial of service attack detection is complicated due to scarcity of
  reliable, widely available and representative contemporary input data. Labelled
  DoS attack datasets are especially rare. Therefore, efficiency of newly proposed
  DoS detection methods is continually verified with obsolete attack samples and tools.
  To address this issue, we provide a comparative analysis of traffic features of
  DoS attacks that were generated by state-of-the-art standalone DoS attack tools,
  which were used in well-known attack campaigns. We provide a classification of different
  attack traffic features, including utilized evasion techniques and encountered traffic
  anomalies. The maturity of DoS attack provision market demonstrated itself in the
  appearance of DDoS-for-hire services. These services are intended for a wide audience
  as they allow executing DoS attacks without any technical knowledge on the side
  of customer. We analyze the threat of DDoS-for-hire services to low and medium power
  cloud-based servers or home users. We aim to investigate popularity and availability
  of such services, their payment models, subscription pricing, complexity of the
  generated attack traffic and performance. iv A progress of every attack against
  a computer system can be described by a well known and widely used kill chain methodology.
  The kill chain specifies that every attack against a computer system goes through
  several clearly identifiable phases. The phases have a fixed order and each phase
  can take place only if all previous phases were successfully completed. We analyze
  the kill chain of DDoS-for-hire services and compare it to kill chain of advanced
  persistent threats. We discuss specifics of kill chain when a DoS attack is carried
  out by two distinct parties, i.e., service owner and customer. Flooding DoS attacks
  frequently have unexpected impacts. In order to design proper detection and mitigation
  systems, it is crucial to discover existing limits and potential new variants of
  contemporary attack types. However, both the development of new DoS attacks and
  manual assessment of DoS attacks resiliency are tedious processes. We created a
  new framework for rapid evolution of denial-of-service attacks by genetic algorithms.
  The framework can be used to identify limits of current DoS attacks as well as to
  evaluate the resiliency of a particular software application against a selected
  DoS attack class. The framework is virtualization-based and provides a high degree
  of automation.

ABS: Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and OpenFlow have brought a promising architecture
  for the future networks. However, there are still a lot of security challenges to

  this paper extends the flow entry counters and adds a mark action of OpenFlow, then
  proposes an entropy-based distributed attack detection model, a novel IP traceback
  and source filtering response mechanism in SDN with OpenFlow-based Deterministic
  Packet Marking. It achieves detecting the attack at the destination and filtering
  the malicious traffic at the source and can be easily implemented in SDN controller
  program, software or programmable switch, such as Open vSwitch and NetFPGA. The
  experimental results show that this scheme can detect the attack quickly, achieve
  a high detection accuracy with a low false positive rate, shield the victim from
  attack traffic and also avoid the attacker consuming resource and bandwidth on the
  intermediate links.

  a new compact name-independent routing scheme whose theoretically proven average
  memory per node is upper-bounded by n gamma, with constant gamma < 1/2, while the
  maximum memory of any node is bounded by square root of n and the maximum stretch
  of any route is bounded by 5. These bounds are given for the Random Power Low Graphs
  (RPLG) and hold with high probability. Moreover, we experimentally show that our
  scheme is very efficient in terms of stretch and memory in internet-like graphs
  (CAIDA and other maps). We complete this study by comparing our analytic and experimental
  results to several compact routing schemes. In particular, we show that the average
  memory requirements is better by at least one order of magnitude than previous schemes
  for CAIDA maps on 16K nodes.

ABS: Identity centric networks (IdCN), in which packets are destined to user identities,
  is one of the future network architectures under discussion. Since user mobility
  is already widely observed in the current Internet and seen as one of the main features
  of the future Internet, seamless mobility needs to be kept in mind for whatever
  routing mechanisms developed for IdCN. However, seamless handoff techniques from
  the IP world wont work because no Care-of-Address or the alike is available in IdCN
  to help quickly locating the mobile users new position, therefore it is difficult
  to redirect the packets in transit before the routing protocol re-finds the moved
  users. In this paper a dynamic ring mechanism that does not rely on but can work
  with any IdCN routing protocol is proposed to support seamless handoff in IdCN.
  During a handoff, the mobile user makes use of this ring to keep its global connectivity,
  and leaves after the handoff finishes. Appropriate timing of hooking to and leaving
  the ring is crucial to keep the overhead at minimum. Experiments show that the proposed
  mechanism can indeed prevent most packet drops and keep the flow running during
  handoffs at reasonably lower cost than simple retransmission.

ABS: 'Cardinality estimation over big network data consisting of numerous flows is
  a fundamental problem with many practical applications. Traditionally the research
  on this problem focused on using a small amount of memory to estimate each flows
  cardinality from a large range (up to $10^9$). However, although the memory needed
  for each flow has been greatly compressed, when there is an extremely large number
  of flows, the overall memory demand can still be very high, exceeding the availability
  under some important scenarios, such as implementing online measurement modules
  in network processors using only on-chip cache memory. In this paper, instead of
  allocating a separated data structure (called estimator) for each flow, we take
  a different path by viewing all the flows together as a whole: Each flow is allocated
  with a virtual estimator, and these virtual estimators share a common memory space.
  We discover that sharing at the register (multi-bit) level is superior than sharing
  at the bit level. We propose a framework of virtual estimators that allows us to
  apply the idea of sharing to an array of cardinality estimation solutions, achieving
  far better memory efficiency than the best existing work. Our experiment shows that
  the new solution can work in a tight memory space of less than 1 bit per flow or
  even one tenth of a bit per flow --- a quest that has never been realized before.'

ABS: Critical infrastructures such as communication networks, electrical grids, and
  transportation systems are highly vulnerable to natural disasters and malicious
  attacks. Even failures of few nodes or links may have a profound impact on large
  parts of the system. Traditionally, network vulnerability assessment methods separate
  the studies of node vulnerability and link vulnerability, and thus ignore joint
  node and link attack schemes that may cause grave damage to the network. To this
  end, we introduce a new assessment method, called beta-disruptor, that unifies both
  link and node vulnerability assessment. The new assessment method is formulated
  as an optimization problem in which we aim to identify a minimum-cost set of mixed
  links and nodes whose removal would severely disrupt the network connectivity. We
  prove the NP-completeness of the problem and propose an O(sqrt{logn}) bicriteria
  approximation algorithm for the beta-disruptor problem. This new theoretical guarantee
  improves the best approximation results for both link and node vulnerability assessment
  in literature. We further enhance the proposed algorithm by embedding it into a
  special combination of simulated annealing and variable neighborhood search method.
  The results of our extensive simulation-based experiments on synthetic and real
  networks show the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed vulnerability assessment
  methods.

ABS: Content centric networking (CCN) has attracted a great deal of attention as a
  network that can efficiently deliver content. In CCN, content is delivered using
  the content name, instead of the host IP address, from cache memory implemented
  at routers. The nodes sending content are not explicitly indicated, and content
  is delivered from routers that have copies of content on the routes where the Interest
  packets are transmitted. Therefore, as a result of introducing CCN in ISP networks,
  the pattern of traffic exchanges among ISPs will change considerably. Customer ISPs
  normally pay a transit fee to transit ISPs based on the traffic volume transmitted
  on the transit links. Therefore, the introduction of CCN by ISPs will affect the
  profit of ISPs. CCN is introduced and operated by ISPs based on their business judgment,
  so it is important to estimate how CCN affects ISP profit to investigate the likelihood
  of CCN spreading among many ISPs. In this paper, we formalize the profit of ISPs
  when implementing CCN, assuming a hierarchical topology of ISPs in three levels
  and show that introducing CCN increases the profit of layer 2 and 3 ISPs, whereas
  introducing CCN decreases the profit of layer 1 ISPs. We also clarify that the effect
  of introducing CCN for the profit of ISPs is more remarkable as the cache capacity
  or the bias of content popularity increases.

ABS: Graph theory has been a wide area of study of discrete mathematics since the
  publication of the Knigsberg bridge solution by Leonard Euler in 1736. Despite its
  historical background and very exciting developments since its birth, graph theory
  was unable to prove useful when studying complex networks. These networks contain
  large amounts of vertices and edges, and the sheer quantity of data that has to
  be handled makes the classical approach not optimal at best and impossible in most
  cases. The last decade has seen an uprising of the random network theory, which
  attempts to study the topology of these complex networks via a statistical approach.
  This theory has proven very successful at modeling these networks, particularly
  when applied to the degree distribution of the vertices of the graphs. This manuscript
  will attempt to summarize the two most important models from a historical point
  of view. First, we will describe the model created by Paul Erdos and Alfred Renyi
  in 1960, which is considered one of the first to attempt to describe these networks.
  The second model was introduced by Lazlo Barabasi and Reka Albert in the late 1990s.
  This model can be considered the spiritual successor of the Erdos-Renyi model, while
  expanding it with some additional properties that were not considered at first.
  It is particularly important because it motivates a new wave of scientific study
  about complex network due to essentially two factors. First, there was more data
  available on complex networks compared to the times when the Erdos-Renyi model was
  proposed. Lastly, computers were now capable of handling the calculations required
  to model these networks and were available to the majority of the scientific community,
  which made the topic much more accessible for new research to be conducted.

ABS: The Resource Public Key Infrastructure is an infrastructure that can be used
  to secure BGP. An application of this infrastructure is origin validation, in which
  a BGP speaker can verify that another BGP speaker has the right to originate certain
  Internet numbers that they advertise, such as IP prefixes. Use of this infrastructure
  is not yet widespread. In this research we attempt to find an optimal way of deploying
  origin validation to the network. We use a BGP simulator to simulate the effects
  on the security and performance of the network using several deployment strategies
  and security policies. We find that deploying origin validation to a smaller groups
  of large ASes give the best results for securing the network. We see that some security
  policies have negative effects on the performance of the network, but have a positive
  effect on the security of the network. Finally, we give insights in the current
  status of BGP security.

ABS: Study and analyze a high speed network (>10Gbps) is a challenge in terms of the
  amount of data to be processed and the data rate itself. As a result, the networking
  capture tools are usually very complex. Those tools also have to be continuously
  adapted to new technology and higher data rates. To meet those requirements, each
  capture tool implements its own formats and way to capture that difficulties its
  interoperability. In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to develop a capture
  tool that stores and works with network data in a well-known format. Standard formats,
  like PCAP, allow different applications to work together easly, even in a paralel
  way. In the same way, common formats frees network analyzing tools from the underlying
  network. Typically, expensive dedicated servers are used to capture, store and process
  network data at high speed rates. However, this is changing due to the proliferation
  of cloud computing and the greatly improved performance virtualization technology.
  This trend makes difficult to find baremetal servers or even network equipment in
  some environments. Therefore, it is becoming more and more important to evaluate
  the performance and feasibility of capture and process network data on virtual environments.
  To achieve that, a capture and store tool has been developed. The tool can work
  at 10 Gbps thanks to Intel DPDK capture technology. A technology, that also can
  work in both bare-metal and virtual environments. In this work, different methods
  and capture tools are compared. In the same way, different virtualization methods
  provided by KVM are evaluated. While running applications in virtual machines have
  a small overhead compared with the bare-metal version, results show that performance
  in virtual environment is really close to bare-metal environment. However, those
  results can only be reached using the correct configuration and the latest advantages
  of the state-of-the-art hardware devices.

ABS: The coordination and management of inter-domain routing in the Internet are crucial
  tasks that happen behind the scenes, while we use the Internet for checking our
  emails, surfing the web, making Skype video calls, watching NetFlix episodes or
  engaging in social networking. The basic protocol that governs inter-domain routing,
  i.e., routing between the diverse administrative network domains, is the Border
  Gateway Protocol (BGP). Researchers have pinpointed several issues with the design
  and operation of BGP over the years, such as slow convergence times or lack of end-to-end
  service guarantees, and have proposed various solutions and improvements. Despite
  this large body of proposals, BGP is extremely resistant to change, albeit the only
  core protocol that virtually every Internet Service Provider (ISP) uses today to
  route packets between domains. Therefore, we need to find ways to address the requirements
  of new Internet services and evolve routing while maintaining compatibility with
  BGP. We thus propose a new architectural approach which can be incrementally deployed
  in todays Internet and which can gradually tackle BGP-related challenges while its
  adoption gains momentum. Within the scope of this work, we address the challenges
  related to the suboptimal convergence behavior, suboptimal path computations and
  lack of inter-domain service guarantees. The approach is general enough to be used
  for optimizing further aspects of inter-domain routing beyond the scope of this
  work.

GEOLOC: Binghamton, NY, US
ABS: 'The prosperity of the Internet has made it attractive to hackers and malicious
  attackers. Distributed attacks, such as: DDoS attacks and Internet worms have become
  major threats towards the network infrastructure. Collaborating existent single-point-deployed
  security applications over multi-domains for distributed defense is promising. Taking
  advantage of the small-world network model, a three-layered network modeling platform
  was developed for exploring behaviors of collaborative defense under the scope of
  a complex system. Using this platform, a comparison study between two major collaborative
  defense schemes was conducted. Their performance and effectiveness against signature-embedded
  worm attacks were evaluated accordingly. Given the rapid evolution of attack methods
  and toolkits, software-based solutions to secure the network infrastructure have
  become overburdened. The performance gap between the execution speed of security
  software and the amount of data to be processed is ever widening. A common solution
  to close this performance gap is through hardware implementation of security functions.
  After a comprehensive survey on major reconfigurable hardware-based approaches application
  on network infrastructure security area, an optimized design of FPGA-based Power
  Spectral Density (PSD) data converter for online Shrew DDoS attack detection was
  proposed and prototyped. Combining an innovative component-reusable Auto-Correlation
  (AC) algorithm and the adapted 2N-point real-valued Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
  algorithm, a maximum reduction of 61.8% processing time from 27471.4 us to 10504.8
  us was achieved. These efficient hardware realization enabled the implementation
  of this design to a Xilinx Virtex2 Pro FGPA. The scalability issue against continuously
  expanding signature databases is another major impediment affecting hardware application
  for network intrusion detection. With the observation that signature patterns are
  constructed from combinations of a limited number of primary patterns, a two-stage
  decomposition approach was developed to solve this issue. The evaluation results
  show that a reduction in size of over 77% can be achieved on top of signature patterns
  extracted from the Snort rule database after decomposition.'

ABS: The Tor anonymity network has been shown vulnerable to traffic analysis attacks
  by autonomous systems (ASes) and Internet exchanges (IXes), which can observe different
  overlay hops belonging to the same circuit. We evaluate whether network path prediction
  techniques provide an accurate picture of the threat from such adversaries, and
  whether they can be used to avoid this threat. We perform a measurement study by
  collecting 17.2 million traceroutes from Tor relays to destinations around the Internet.
  We compare the collected traceroute paths to predicted paths using state-of-the-art
  path inference techniques. We find that traceroutes present a very different picture,
  with the set of ASes seen in the traceroute path differing from the predicted path
  80% of the time. We also consider the impact that prediction errors have on Tor
  security. Using a simulator to choose paths over a week, our traceroutes indicate
  a user has nearly a 100% chance of at least one compromise in a week with 11% of
  total paths containing an AS compromise and less than 1% containing an IX compromise
  when using default Tor selection. We find modifying the path selection to choose
  paths predicted to be safe lowers total paths with an AS compromise to 0.14% but
  still presents a 5-11% chance of at least one compromise in a week while making
  5% of paths fail, with 96% of failures due to false positives in path inferences.
  Our results demonstrate more measurement and better path prediction is necessary
  to mitigate the risk of AS and IX adversaries to Tor.

  which is increasing its popularity in the last years. This work gives emphasis to
  avoid DDoS attacks in this net where the existence of Protection system is almost
  null. To reach this goal the infrastructure and functioning of Tor have been deeply
  studied. In addition a detection system based in anomalies has been developed. It
  is divided in two different sections. The first one consist of a data model based
  in metrics to obtain  entropy  values.  The  objective  of  the  second  one  is  the  development  of  an
  efficient prediction model that also takes care of the accuracy. The experimentation
  performed in the usual net, but also in the Tor net has shown really satisfactory
  results.  The  true  positive  rate  obtained  was  really  high  compared  with  the  false
  positive rate which has truly low rate.

  Not  only  this  attacks  have  been  very  popular  on  Tor,  but  also  on  the  Internet.
  In the present work, an anomaly-based detection system is proposed for detecting

ABS: The Internet measurement community is beset by a lack of ground truth, or knowledge

  tools and methodologies can be developed, quantifying the effectiveness of these
  mapping utilities and explaining pathologies is difficult, if not impossible, without
  knowing the network topology being probed. In this thesis we present a tool that
  eliminates topological uncertainty in an emulated, virtualized environment. First,
  we automatically build topological ground truth according to various network generation
  models and create emulated Cisco router networks by leveraging and modifying existing
  emulation software. We then automate topological inference from one vantage point
  at a time for every vantage point in the network. Finally, we incorporate a mechanism
  to study common sources of network topology inference abnormalities by including
  the ability to induce link failures within the network. In addition, this thesis
  reexamines previous work in sampling Autonomous System-level Internet graphs to
  procure realistic models for emulation and simulation. We build upon this work by
  including additional data sets, and more recent Internet topologies to sample from,
  and observe divergent results from the authors of the original work. Lastly, we
  introduce a new technique for sampling Internet graphs that better retains particular
  graph metrics across multiple timeframes and data sets.

ABS: We address the problem of scaling authentication for naming, routing, and end-entity
  certification to a global environment in which authentication policies and users
  sets of trust roots vary widely. The current mechanisms for authenticating names
  (DNSSEC), routes (BGPSEC), and end-entity certificates (TLS) do not support a coexistence
  of authentication policies, affect the entire Internet when compromised, cannot
  update trust root information efficiently, and do not provide users with the ability
  to make flexible trust decisions. We propose a Scalable Authentication Infrastructure
  for Next-generation Trust (SAINT), which partitions the Internet into groups with
  common, local trust roots, and isolates the effects of a compromised trust root.
  SAINT requires groups with direct routing connections to cross-sign each other for
  authentication purposes, allowing diverse authentication policies while keeping
  all entities globally verifiable. SAINT makes trust root management a central part
  of the network architecture, enabling trust root updates within seconds and allowing
  users to make flexible trust decisions. SAINT operates without a significant performance
  penalty and can be deployed alongside existing infrastructures.

ABS: The flexibility of the current Domain Name System (DNS) has been stretched to
  its limits to accommodate new applications such as content delivery networks and
  dynamic DNS. In particular, maintaining cache consistency has become a much larger
  problem, as emerging technologies require increasingly-frequent updates to DNS records.
  Though Time-To-Live (TTL) is the most widely used method of controlling cache consistency,
  it does not offer the fine-grained control necessary for handling these frequent
  changes. In addition, TTLs are too static to handle sudden changes in traffic caused
  by Internet failures or social media trends, demonstrating their inflexibility in
  the face of unforeseen events. To address these problems, we first propose a metric
  called Expected Aggregate Inconsistency (EAI), which allows us to consider important
  factors such as a records update frequency and popularity when quantitatively measuring
  inconsistency. We then design ECO-DNS, a lightweight system that leverages the information
  provided by EAI to optimize a records TTL. This value can be tuned to individual
  cache servers preferences between better consistency and bandwidth overhead. Further-more,
  our optimization models flexibility allows us to easily adapt ECO-DNS to handle
  various caching hierarchies such as multi-level caching while considering the trade
  off among consistency, overhead, latency, and server load.

  elephant flows from the NetFlow records, and assemble parallel flowsets from elephant
  flows. Our findings are as follows. The top 1% of flowset sizes were in the hundreds
  of GBs to low TBs range, 95% of flowsets had rates less than 2.5 Gbps, and 99% of
  flowsets had durations shorter than 4 hours. Median flowset rate increases and rate
  variance decreases with increasing number of per-flowset component flows. Such findings
  are useful for network planning, traffic engineering, and for improving user performance,
  since large dataset transfers are among the most demanding of network applications.

ABS: Route leaks are among the several inter-domain routing anomalies that have the
  potential to cause large scale service disruptions on the Internet. The reason behind
  the occurrence of route leaks is the violation of routing policies among Autonomous
  Systems (ASes). There exist a few rudimentary solutions that can be used as a first
  line of defense, such as the utilization of route filters, but these palliatives
  become unfeasible in large domains due to the administrative overhead and the cost
  of maintaining the filters updated. As a result, a significant part of the Internet
  is defenseless against route leak attacks. In this paper, we examine the different
  types of route leaks and propose detection methodologies for improving the reliability
  of the routing system. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows. We develop
  a relatively basic theoretical framework, which, under realistic assumptions, enables
  a domain to autonomously determine if a particular route advertisement received
  from a neighbor corresponds to a route leak. Based on this, we propose three incremental
  methodologies, namely Cross-Path (CP), Benign Fool Back (BFB), and Reverse Benign
  Fool Back (R-BFB), for autonomously detecting route leaks. Our strength resides
  in the fact that these detection techniques solely require the analysis of control
  and data plane information available within the domain. We analyze the performance
  of the proposed route leak identification techniques both through real-time experiments
  as well as simulations at large scale. Our results show that the proposed detection
  techniques achieve high success rates for countering route leaks in different scenarios.

  improvement in detection of Distributed Denial of Service attacks based on fast

  use of since both network activities and users behavior could vary over time. Fast
  Entropy and flow-based analysis show significant reduction in computational time
  compared to conventional entropy computation while maintaining good detection accuracy.
  The network traffic is analyzed and fast entropy of request per flow is calculated.
  DDoS attack is detected when the difference between entropy of flow count at each
  instant and mean value of entropy in that time interval is greater than the threshold
  value that is updated adaptively based on traffic pattern condition to improve the
  detection accuracy.

ABS: We consider a new type of distinct element counting problem in dynamic data streams,
  where (1) insertions and deletions of an element can appear not only in the same
  data stream but also in two or more different streams, (2) a deletion of a distinct
  element cancels out all the previous insertions of this element, and (3) a distinct
  element can be re-inserted after it has been deleted. Our goal is to count the number
  of distinct elements that were inserted but have not been deleted in a continuous
  data stream. We also solve this new type of distinct element counting problem in
  a distributed setting. This problem is motivated by several network monitoring and
  attack detection applications where network traffic can be modelled as single or
  distributed dynamic streams and the number of distinct elements in the data streams,
  such as unsuccessful TCP connection setup requests, is calculated to be used as
  an indicator to detect certain network events such as service outage and DDoS attacks.
  Although there are known tight bounds for distinct element counting in insertion-only
  data streams, no good bounds are known for it in dynamic data streams, neither for
  this new type of problem. None of the existing solutions for distinct element counting
  can solve our problem. In this paper, we will present the first solution to this

ABS: Spam messages are used to disseminate malware, make phishing attacks, and advertise
  illegal products. Spam generates costs to users, e.g., victims of phishing, and
  to network administrators, e.g., who provision and pay for the traffic. Recent proposals
  aim to identify and filter spam messages at the origin, restraining message propagation
  and reducing wasted bandwidth on the route from the spammer to the destination.
  In this work we analyze spam traffic costs for network operators. We measure the
  routes traversed by real spam messages colected at five honeypots, and estimate
  spam traffic costs according to the business relationships between networks traversed
  on each route. We show that stub networks are systematically encumbered by high
  spam traffic costs but can cooperate to filter up to 70% of spam messages at the
  origin. Our results also indicate that transit networks that send a lot of spam
  may employ traffic engineering to reduce their transit costs.

ABS: Early studies on forecasting the growth of the Internet suggested that its evolution
  could not be predicted as being simply the result of a random network formation
  process. Recent evidence has shown that commercial connectivity goes through cycles,
  due to providers regularly disconnecting their customers. We model these cycles
  as being a result of the providers limited ability to monitor their customers contractual
  compliance. Based on twelve years of quarterly observations, we estimate the impacts
  of key covariates on the probability of starting a connectivity war. Following a
  choice model approach, we use different econometric specifications to test the model
  implications. Our results predict that the asymmetry between customers and providers,
  which increases the incentives to abuse connectivity, and the history of past connections,
  which affects mutual trust and information asymmetries, are the main factors in
  determining the probability of providers starting a connectivity war, thus helping
  to explain the cycles that are observed in Internet connectivity.

ABS: The concept of Cloud Computing has brought a new dimension in the IT industry
  by offering online services to the international community on pay-as-you go basis.
  The architecture allows the clients to pay for what they use, minimizing the operational
  costs and leaving the hassle of system support to the service providers. Although
  cloud computing is a good and an attractive concept to the business community; it
  still has some challenges such as traffic management that need to be addressed.
  Most network service providers experience traffic congestion when messages arrive
  and queue at the service point due to limited processing capacity. That is what
  this research intends to mitigate by proposing a proactive traffic prediction model
  that would play a role in congestion control and estimation of accurate future resource
  demand in order to achieve guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) rather than depending
  on reactive resource provisioning models. For this research, four time series models
  being Single Exponential Smoothing (SES), Double Exponential Smoothing (DES), Triple
  Exponential Smoothing (TES) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
  are compared in order to identify the one that can accurately predict the future
  performance of an IaaS cloud provider. The research is based on restricted traffic
  measurements which consist of the number of users and the amount of downloaded data
  taken from CAIDA database. More emphasis is put on the amount of traffic that goes
  through cloud network. The measurements used have monthly and yearly data making
  it a total of four (4) datasets. All the coding, testing of the hypothesis and the
  statistical work of the project are performed using R- programming language. From
  the study, the predictions of ARIMA are more accurate as compared to those of others
  and have smallest RMSE and MAE. It was also observed that all the models perform
  better on monthly data as compared to yearly data.

ABS: AS-level end-to-end paths are of great value for ISPs and a variety of network
  applications. Although tools like traceroute may reveal AS paths, they require the
  permission to access source hosts and introduce additional probing traffic, which
  is not feasible in many applications. In contrast, AS path inference based on BGP
  control plane data and AS relationship information is a more practical and cost-effective
  approach. However, this approach suffers from a limited accuracy and high traffic,
  especially when AS paths are long. In this paper, we bring a new angle to the AS
  path inference problem by exploiting the metrical tree-likeness or low hyperbolicity
  of the Internet, part of the complex network properties of the Internet. We show
  that such property can generate a new constraint that narrows down the searching
  space of possible AS paths to a much smaller size. Based on this observation, we
  propose two new AS path inference algorithms, namely HyperPath and Valley-free HyperPath.
  With intensive evaluations on AS paths from real-world BGP Routing Information Bases,
  we show that the proposed new algorithms can achieve superior performance, in particular,
  when AS paths are long paths. We demonstrate that our algorithms can significantly
  reduce inter-AS traffic for P2P applications with an improved AS path prediction
  accuracy.

  introduce an algorithm that considers the degree information of nodes (users) to
  model how reputations spread within the network. In our algorithm, each node updates
  reputations about its neighbors by considering the history of interactions and the
  frequency of the interactions in recent history. The algorithm also captures the
  phenomena of accuracy of reputations deteriorating over time if interactions have
  not occurred recently. We present the following two contributions through experiments:
  (1) We show that an agents reputation value is influenced by the position of the
  node in the network and the neighboring topology; and (2) We also show that our
  algorithm can compute more accurate reputations than existing algorithms especially
  when the topological information matters. The experiments are conducted in random

ABS: With the growing prevalence of cyber threats in the world, various security monitoring
  systems are being employed to protect the network and resources from the cyber attacks.
  The large network datasets that are generated in this process by security monitoring
  systems need an efficient design for integrating and processing them at a faster
  rate. In this research, a storage design scheme has been developed using HBase and
  Hadoop that can efficiently integrate, store, and retrieve security-related datasets.
  The design scheme is a value-based data integration approach, where data is integrated
  by columns instead of by rows. Since rowkeys are the most important aspect of HBase
  table design and performance, a rowkey design was chosen based on the most frequently
  accessed columns associated with use cases for the retrieval of the dataset statistics.
  Tests conducted on various schema design alternatives prove that the rate at which
  the datasets are stored and retrieved using the model designed as part of this research
  is higher than that of the standard method of storing data in HBase. Network datasets
  representing DDoS attacks have been used for integration in this research. Use case
  requirements have been identified, which are related to the characteristics of attacker
  IP addresses from the integrated datasets, to generate statistical data. This statistical
  data was used to run the Logistic Regression (LR) classification algorithm for classifying
  the network traffic data into attack-related and non-attack related traffic. The
  Fuzzy k-Means (FKM) algorithm was also used to create clusters of attackers and
  non-attacks to segregate the attack-related traffic from the network datasets. The
  results obtained from the two algorithms show that both LR and FKM algorithms can
  successfully classify the network traffic datasets into attackers and non-attackers.

ABS: 'Network virtualisation is a promising technique for dealing with the resistance

  resource sharing in network virtualisation by dividing the resource management problem
  into three sub-problems: virtual network embedding (VNE), dynamic resource allocation
  (DRA), and virtual network survivability (VNS); and then proposing a solution for
  each one of them. Specifically, we propose a path generation-based approach for
  VNE, machine learning-based self-management approaches for DRA, and a multi-entity

GEOLOC: Baltimore, MD, US
ABS: Large-scale attacks on computer networks usually cause abrupt changes in network
  traffic, which makes change detection an integral part of attack detection especially
  in large communication networks. Such changes in traffic can be defined in terms
  of sudden absence of key nodes or edges, or the addition of new nodes and edges
  to the network. These are micro level changes. This on the other hand may lead to
  changes at the macro level of the network such as changes in the density and diameter
  of the network that describe connectivity between nodes as well as flow of information
  within the network. Our assumption is that, changes in the behavior of such key
  nodes in a network translates into changes in the overall structure of the network
  since these key nodes represent the major chunk of communication in the network.
  In this study, we focus on detecting changes at the network-level where we sample
  the network and select key subgraphs associated to central nodes. Our objective
  is to study selected network-level properties because they provide a bigger picture
  of underlying events in the network.

ABS: We investigate how to build a non-intrusive scheduled TCP. For the flows of a
  given origin-destination pair, the objective is to schedule their TCP segments (according
  to some desired criteria) without modifying the network bandwidth-share used by
  these flows, which in turn ensures friendliness with respect to the rest of the
  network. We show that in order for a scheduling algorithm to be strictly non-intrusive,
  a sufficient and necessary condition is that the senders and receivers buffers are
  infinite. We then show that, under the additional condition that segments are neither
  lost or reordered, the number of active TCP flows can be minimized by size-based
  schedulers, and we propose a new scheduler FAIR, which guarantees that the transfer
  time of every TCP flow for the origin-destination pair is reduced. We develop SCHED_TCP,
  a user space implementation of our scheme in order to evaluate its performance on
  the Internet. Our experiments illustrate the non-intrusive property of SCHED_TCP,
  and also illustrate that the performance gain with SCHED_TCP can be considerable.
  Our scheme is scalable, and it could be incrementally deployed on the Internet improving
  the user experience on every origin-destination pair. The main application domain
  of our approach correspond to situations in which there are many concurrent TCP
  connections within the same origin-destination pair, this might happen as a consequence
  of HTTP 1.1, Web 2.0 applications using AJAX (Google Maps etc.), Split TCP, Parallel
  Sockets, and also with the use of ChromeBooks where the user accesses to all services

  Internet traffic data. Simulation results indicate that BF-LRU can not only achieve
  lower error probability, but also scale up to OC-768 backbone trace without losing

ABS: Measurement capabilities are essential for a variety of network applications,
  such as load balancing, routing, fairness and intrusion detection. These capabilities
  require large counter arrays in order to monitor the traffic of all network flows.
  While commodity SRAM memories are capable of operating at line speed, they are too
  small to accommodate large counter arrays. Previous works suggested estimators,
  which trade precision for reduced space. However, in order to accurately estimate
  the largest counter, these methods compromise the accuracy of the rest of the counters.
  In this work we present a closed form representation of the optimal estimation function.
  We then introduce Independent Counter Estimation Buckets (ICE-Buckets), a novel
  algorithm that improves estimation accuracy for all counters. This is achieved by
  separating the flows to buckets and configuring the optimal estimation function
  according to each buckets counter scale. We prove an improved upper bound on the
  relative error and demonstrate an accuracy improvement of up to 57 times on real
  Internet packet traces.

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a serious threat to efficient
  and uninterrupted Internet services. During Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS),
  attackers make fool of innocent servers (i.e., Slave) into reddening packets to
  the victim. Most low-rate DDoS attack detection mechanisms are associated with specific
  protocols used by the attacks. Due to the use of slave, it has been found that the
  traffic flow for such an attack and their response flow to the victim may have linear
  relationships with another. Based on this observation, we propose the Partial Rank
  Correlation-based Detection (PRCD) scheme to detect both low-rate and high-rate
  DDoS attacks. Our experimental results confirm theoretical analysis and demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in practice.

ABS: DDoS flooding attack is a critical threat to the normal operation of network.
  However, current feature-based detection methods are cheated by hackers easily and
  most of these mechanisms do not differentiate between DDoS flooding attacks and
  legitimate random flash crowds with feature independent and location extended. To
  address the challenges, we propose a two-stage detection strategy by combining superpoints
  and flow similarity measurement. To locate the suspicious flows, polymerization
  degree of destination superpoints is introduced in a moving time window mechanism.
  Based on the suspicious flows, a sliding-detection algorithm is presented for distinguishing
  flooding attacks from flash crowds with similarity metrics. Computer simulation
  results indicate that our detection approach can detect DDoS flooding attacks efficiently
  and Total Variation Distance (TVD) is the most suitable metric for discriminating
  DDoS flooding attack flows from flash crowds. Built on flow arrivals, the proposed
  mechanism is practical for the attack detection on high speed links.

ABS: Motivated by the effectiveness of correlation attacks against Tor, the censorship
  arms race, and observations of malicious relays in Tor, we propose that Tor users
  capture their trust in network elements using probability distributions over the
  sets of elements observed by network adversaries. We present a modular system that
  allows users to efficiently and conveniently create such distributions and use them
  to improve their security. To illustrate this system, we present two novel types
  of adversaries. First, we study a powerful, pervasive adversary that can compromise
  an unknown number of Autonomous System organizations, Internet Exchange Point organizations,
  and Tor relay families. Second, we initiate the study of how an adversary might
  use Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) to enact surveillance. As part of this,
  we identify submarine cables as a potential subject of trust and incorporate data
  about these into our MLAT analysis by using them as a proxy for adversary power.
  Finally, we present preliminary experimental results that show the potential for
  our trust framework to be used by Tor clients and services to improve security.

ABS: Determining the right amount of resources needed for a given computation is a
  critical problem. In many cases, computing systems are configured to use an amount
  of resources to manage high load peaks even though this cause energy waste when
  the resources are not fully utilised. To avoid this problem, adaptive approaches
  are used to dynamically increase/decrease computational resources depending on the
  real needs. A different approach based on Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling
  (DVFS) is emerging as a possible alternative solution to reduce energy consumption
  of idle CPUs by lowering their frequencies. In this work, we propose to tackle the
  problem in stream parallel computations by using both the classic adaptivity concepts
  and the possibility provided by modern CPUs to dynamically change their frequency.
  We validate our approach showing a real network application that performs Deep Packet
  Inspection over network traffic. We are able to manage bandwidth changing over time,
  guaranteeing minimal packet loss during reconfiguration and minimal energy consumption.

ABS: The growing demand for network programmability has led to the introduction of
  complex packet processing features that are increasingly hard to provide at full
  line rates. In this paper, we introduce a novel load-balancing approach that provides
  more processing power to congested linecards by tapping into the processing power
  of underutilized linecards. Using different switch-fabric models, we introduce algorithms
  that aim at minimizing the total average delay and maximizing the capacity region.
  Our simulations with real-life traces then confirm that our algorithms outperform
  current algorithms as well as simple alternative load-balancing algorithms. Finally,
  we discuss the implementation issues involved in this new way of sharing the router
  processing power.

  the level of peering among Africas Internet service providers remains low. Using
  active network measurements, this work characterizes the level of interconnectivity

  examines the performance of traffic exchange in terms of latencies. This paper shows
  that over 75% of Africas inter-university traffic follows circuitous inter-continental
  routes, and is characterised by latencies that are more than double those of traffic

ABS: Scalable and automated monitoring processes for testing, debugging, and operation
  of VNFs and service-chains are crucial components towards achieving the aims of
  network softwarization - i.e., cheaper, faster, and shorter service deployment and
  network management processes. In this paper we present a decentralized monitoring
  approach aimed at supporting automated deployment and operation of VNFs and service-chains.
  The approach is inspired by network tomography and is designed to address observability
  limitations and scalability issues that arise from performing measurements from
  an SDN controller. From successive end-to-end measurements link metrics are derived
  via in-network parameter estimation with no need of forwarding raw measurements
  to the controller, which significantly reduces the measurement overhead compared
  to when monitoring individual links explicitly from an SDN controller.

GEOLOC: Halifax, CA
ABS: Since the occurrence and variety of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) has
  dramatically increased, the discovery of DDoS signatures (rules) become very difficult
  for current intrusion detection mechanisms. Darknets, which refer to unallocated
  Internet Protocol (IP) addresses in a network, are used to collect attack traffic
  to reveal the potential signatures. Backscatter, a behaviour observed in darknets,
  is a side effect of DDoS attacks generated by victim responds to the spoofed IP
  addresses. This thesis explores general backscatter patterns mostly based on the
  major transport, network and application layer protocols and ports. A detailed evaluation
  expressing the performances of five different signature-based network traffic monitoring
  systems, namely Snort, Bro, Iatmon, Corsaro and Ciscos Adaptive Security Appliance
  (ASA) 5515-X, over backscatter traffic is also presented. Moreover, this thesis
  analyzes the performances of three machine learning techniques, namely C4.5 Decision
  Tree, Naive Bayes and AdaBoost.M1, in terms of the detection rate, false alarm rate,
  computational cost and ease of use of these techniques. Additionally, different
  training sets with different sizes and different feature sets are used to study
  the effects of training datasets and data pre-processing, respectively. Five different
  feature sets depending on the two well-known feature selection approaches, namely
  Chi-Square and Symmetrical Uncertainty, as well as the most commonly used features
  in the literature are included in these studies. All of the evaluations are performed
  on six different publicly available one-way darknet datasets collected between 2004
  and 2012 by CAIDA. The results show that the attack trends in the employed datasets
  are important to understand the nature of DDoS traffic. Furthermore, the signatures
  generated by a machine learning system are robust in detecting DDoS traffic even
  when the training set is small and the attack trends are changing over time.

ABS: Epidemic spreading phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and society. Examples include
  the spreading of diseases, information, and computer viruses. Epidemics can spread
  by local spreading, where infected nodes can only infect a limited set of direct
  target nodes and global spreading, where an infected node can infect every other
  node. In reality, many epidemics spread using a hybrid mixture of both types of
  spreading. In this study we develop a theoretical framework for studying hybrid
  epidemics, and examine the optimum balance between spreading mechanisms in terms
  of achieving the maximum outbreak size. We show the existence of critically hybrid
  epidemics where neither spreading mechanism alone can cause a noticeable spread
  but a combination of the two spreading mechanisms would produce an enormous outbreak.
  Our results provide new strategies for maximising beneficial epidemics and estimating
  the worst outcome of damaging hybrid epidemics.

ABS: This paper proposes a method for optimizing bandwidth usage in Software Defined
  Networks (SDNs) based on OpenFlow. Flows of small packets presenting a high overhead,
  as the ones generated by emerging services, can be identified by the SDN controller,
  in order to remove header fields that are common to any packet in the flow, only
  during their way through the SDN. At the same time, several packets can be multiplexed
  together in the same frame, thus reducing the overall number of frames. The method
  can be useful for providing QoS while the packets are traversing the SDN. Four kinds
  of small-packet traffic flows are considered (VoIP, UDP and TCP-based online games,
  and ACKs from TCP flows). Both IPv4 and IPv6 are studied, and significant bandwidth
  savings (up to 68 % for IPv4 and 78 % for IPv6) can be obtained for the considered
  kinds of traffic. The optimization method is also applied to different public Internet
  traffic traces, and significant reductions in terms of packets per second are achieved.
  Results show that bandwidth consumption is also reduced, especially in those traces
  where the percentage of small packets is high. Regarding the effect on QoS, the
  additional delay can be kept very low (below 1 millisecond) when the throughput
  is high, but it may become significant for low-throughput scenarios. Thus, a trade-off
  between bandwidth saving and additional delay appears in those cases.

ABS: Recent years have seen the rise of middleboxes, such as firewalls, NATs, proxies,
  or Deep Packet Inspectors. Those middleboxes play an important role in todays Internet,
  including enterprise networks and cellular networks. However, despite their huge
  success in modern network architecture, they have a negative impact on the Internet
  evolution as they can slow down the TCP protocol evolution and its extensions. Making
  available a summary of the potential middlebox network interferences is of the highest
  importance as it could allow researchers to confront their new transport protocol
  to potential issues caused by middleboxes. And, consequently, allowing again innovation
  in the Internet. This is exactly what we tackle in this paper. We propose a path
  impairment oriented middlebox taxonomy that aims at categorizing the initial purpose
  of a middlebox policy as well as its potential unexpected complications. Based on
  a measurement campaign on IPv4 and IPv6 networks, we confront our taxonomy to the
  real world. Our dataset is freely available.

TOPKEY: topology-ark-ipv6-traceroute
GEOLOC: College Park, MD, US
ABS: As the IPv6 Internet grows, alias resolution in IPv6 becomes more important.
  Traditional IPv4 alias resolution techniques such as Ally do not work for IPv6 because
  of protocol differences. Recent techniques adopted specifically for IPv6 have shown
  promise, but utilize source routing, which has since been deprecated, or rely upon
  sequential fragment identifiers supported on only a third of router interfaces.
  As a result, IPv6 alias resolution remains an open problem. This paper introduces
  UAv6, a new alias resolution technique for IPv6. UAv6 finds aliases in two phases.
  The first harvest phase gathers potential alias pairs, and is based on our empirical
  observation that addresses adjacent to router interface addresses are often unused.
  UAv6 probes these unused addresses, eliciting ICMPv6 Address Unreachable responses.
  The central assumption of this work is that the source address of such a response
  belongs to a router directly connected to the prefix containing the unused and router
  interface addresses. The second disambiguation phase determines which interface
  address is an alias of the Address Unreachables source address. UAv6 uses both new
  and established techniques to construct proofs or disproofs that two addresses are
  aliases. We confirm the accuracy of UAv6 by running the Too-Big Trick test upon
  the aliases we find, and by comparing them with limited ground truth. We also show
  that the classic address-based technique to resolve aliases in IPv4 works for IPv6
  as well, and show that the address-based technique, UAv6, and the Too-Big Trick
  are complementary techniques in resolving IPv6 aliases.

ABS: Due to the rapid growth of the Internet, the available pool of unique addresses

  the next generation protocol, IPv6, is now widely implemented and rapidly being
  adopted. This thesis examines new methods for active mapping of the IPv6 topology,
  i.e., router and link discovery. Better characterization of the IPv6 topology can
  provide the Department of Defense and other federal agencies the ability to defend
  networks and more effectively respond to cyber attacks. However, given that the
  IPv6 address space is roughly 79 billion billion billion times larger than the IPv4
  space, mapping in IPv6 introduces new network measurement challenges. As a first
  step toward intelligent IPv6 topology discovery, this thesis takes lessons learned
  in efficient IPv4 mapping algorithms and attempts to apply them to IPv6. We develop
  several novel IPv6 mapping techniques and evaluate their probing time and topological
  coverage as compared to current state-of-the-art systems. Finally, we uncover previously
  unrecognized properties of several IPv6 deployments, infer network topologies, and
  characterize common IPv6 subnetting structure.

ABS: While traditional data management systems focus on evaluating single, ad hoc
  queries over static data sets in a centralized setting, several emerging applications
  require (possibly, continuous) answers to queries on dynamic data that is widely
  distributed and constantly updated. Furthermore, such query answers often need to
  discount data that is stale and operate solely on a sliding window of recent data
  arrivals (e.g., data updates occurring over the last 24 h). Such distributed data
  streaming applications mandate novel algorithmic solutions that are both time and
  space efficient (to manage high-speed data streams) and also communication efficient
  (to deal with physical data distribution). In this paper, we consider the problem
  of complex query answering over distributed, high-dimensional data streams in the
  sliding-window model. We introduce a novel sketching technique (termed ECM-sketch)
  that allows effective summarization of streaming data over both time-based and count-based
  sliding windows with probabilistic accuracy guarantees. Our sketch structure enables
  point, as well as inner product, queries and can be employed to address a broad
  range of problems, such as maintaining frequency statistics, finding heavy hitters,
  and computing quantiles in the sliding-window model. Focusing on distributed environments,
  we demonstrate how ECM-sketches of individual, local streams can be composed to
  generate a (low-error) ECM-sketch summary of the order-preserving merging of all
  streams; furthermore, we show how ECM-sketches can be exploited for continuous monitoring
  of sliding-window queries over distributed streams. Our extensive experimental study
  with two real-life data sets validates our theoretical claims and verifies the effectiveness
  of our techniques. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to address
  efficient, guaranteed-error complex query answering over distributed data streams
  in the sliding-window model.

ABS: Every day, adversaries bombard Department of Defense computer networks with scanning

  is typically a precursor to attacks designed to access data, exfiltrate information,

  tool, traceroute, is used to map the network topology of a target network. We implement
  an active network defense tool, dubbed DeTracer, that seeks to thwart network mapping
  attacks through the use of deception. We deploy DeTracer in several environments,
  including the Internet, to demonstrate that an attacker attempting to map a target
  network using traceroute probes can be presented with a false network topology of
  the defenders choosing. Our experiments show that a defender can present an adversary
  with a credible false network topology. We are able to deceive all types of incoming

ABS: Bloom filters (BFs) provide a fast and efficient way to check whether a given
  element belongs to a set. The BFs are used in numerous applications, for example,
  in communications and networking. There is also ongoing research to extend and enhance
  BFs and to use them in new scenarios. Reliability is becoming a challenge for advanced
  electronic circuits as the number of errors due to manufacturing variations, radiation,
  and reduced noise margins increase as technology scales. In this brief, it is shown
  that BFs can be used to detect and correct errors in their associated data set.
  This allows a synergetic reuse of existing BFs to also detect and correct errors.
  This is illustrated through an example of a counting BF used for IP traffic classification.
  The results show that the proposed scheme can effectively correct single errors
  in the associated set. The proposed scheme can be of interest in practical designs
  to effectively mitigate errors with a reduced overhead in terms of circuit area
  and power.

ABS: The contribution of this thesis is the study, design and implementation of a
  resilient and secure communication infrastructure for decentralized peer-to-peer
  networks. On todays Internet, free and unrestricted communication between users
  is often restricted due to limited connectivity between participants, attempts to
  degrade service for certain traffic classes and other filtering and manipulation
  attempts. Peer-to-peer networks are in particular impacted by these effects since
  peer-to-peer networks are a target for censorship attempts due to the lack of a
  centralized node to control, their dependency on end-to-end connectivity and on
  a neutral network treating all traffic classes equally. In this thesis, we design
  and implement a communication infrastructure for decentralized peer-to-peer networks
  employing existing Internet infrastructure and technologies with the goal of re-establishing
  unhindered communication between users. The proposed communication infrastructure
  tries to provide and improve connectivity between participants and to improve quality
  of service for applications by detecting and counteracting traffic management and
  degradation attempts. The communication infrastructure has the goal to make communication
  resilient against censorship attempts and provides with GNS a public key infrastructure
  that provides a secure, resilient, and privacy-preserving way to map human-memorable
  names to addresses and other information.

ABS: We show that the strength of Internet-based network interconnectivity of countries
  is increasing over time. We then evaluate bounds on the extent to which a group
  of colluding countries can disrupt this connectivity. We evaluate the degree to
  which a group of countries can disconnect two other countries, isolate a set of
  countries from the Internet, or even break the Internet up into non-communicative
  clusters. To do this, we create an interconnectivity map of the worldwide Internet
  routing infrastructure at a country level of abstraction. We then examine how groups
  of countries may use their pieces of routing infrastructure to filter out the traffic
  of other countries (or to block entire routes). Overall, bounds analysis indicates
  that the ability of countries to perform such disruptions to connectivity has diminished
  significantly from 2008 to 2013. However, we show that the majority of the gains
  in robustness go to countries that had already displayed significant robustness
  to the types of attacks that we consider. The countries that displayed higher initial
  vulnerability to such attacks did not become significantly more robust over the
  time period of analysis

ABS: Network virtualisation promises to lead to better manageability of the future
  Internet by allowing for adaptable sharing of physical network resources among different
  virtual networks. However, the sharing of resources is not trivial as virtual nodes
  and links should first be mapped onto substrate nodes and links, and thereafter
  the allocated resources managed throughout the lifetime of the virtual network.
  In this paper, we design and evaluate reinforcement learning-based neuro-fuzzy algorithms
  that perform dynamic, decentralised and coordinated self-management of substrate
  network resources. The objective is to achieve better efficiency in the utilisation
  of substrate network resources while ensuring that the quality of service requirements
  of the virtual networks are not violated. The proposed algorithms are evaluated
  through comparisons with a Q-learning-based approach as well as two static resource
  allocation schemes.

ABS: Many researchers have tried to design mechanisms to resist Distributed Denial

  Recently, Yaar et al.[1] suggested Pi (short for Path Identifier) marking scheme
  as one of solutions to thwart DDoS attacks, which is fast and effective in dropping
  the false positive and negative packets from users and attackers. They make use
  of the IP Identification field of which length is 16 bits as marking section. Every
  router en-route to the victim marks 1-bit or 2-bits by wrapping method sequentially.
  The victim drops the false positive and negative packets according to the attack
  markings list. The performance of Pi is measured for marking bit size of 1 or 2
  bits. This paper suggests the method to decide the marking bit size dynamically
  in accordance with the number of hop counts. The performance is quite improved,
  compared with the existing one.

ABS: 'Despite the world-changing success of the Internet, shortcomings in its routing
  and forwarding system have become increasingly apparent. One symptom is an escalating
  tension between users and providers over the control of routing and forwarding of
  packets: providers understandably want to control use of their infrastructure, and
  users understandably want paths with sufficient quality-of-service (QoS) to improve
  the performance of their applications. As a result, users resort to various hacks
  such as sending traffic through intermediate end-systems, and the providers fight
  back with mechanisms to inspect and block such traffic. To enable users and providers
  to jointly control routing and forwarding policies, recent research has considered
  various architectural approaches in which provider- level route determination occurs
  separately from forwarding. With this separation, provider-level path computation
  and selection can be provided as a centralized service: users (or their applications)
  send path queries to a path service to obtain provider- level paths that meet their
  application-specific QoS requirements. At the same time, providers can control the
  use of their infrastructure by dictating how packets are forwarded across their
  network. The separation of routing and forwarding offers many advantages, but also
  brings a number of challenges such as scalability. In particular, the path service
  must respond to path queries in a timely manner and periodically collect topology
  information containing load-dependent (i.e., performance) routing information. We
  present a new design for a path service that makes use of expensive pre- computations,
  parallel on-demand computations on performance information, and caching of recently
  computed paths to achieve scalability. We demonstrate that, us- ing commodity hardware
  with a modest amount of resources, the path service can respond to path queries
  with acceptable latency under a realistic workload. The ser- vice can scale to arbitrarily
  large topologies through parallelism. Finally, we describe how to utilize the path
  service in the current Internet with existing Internet applica- tions.'

ABS: Geolocation systems generally fall into two categories. Commercial systems provide
  precomputed address-to-locationmappings for all IP addresses. We refer to such systems
  as geolocation databases. Upon presenting a geolocation database with a target IP
  address, a location estimate is provided immediately. Almost all systems reported
  in the academic literature, on the other hand, employ active measurements, issuing
  probes to a target after it has been specified, but before estimating the location
  of the target. These systems use constraints derived from the measurements to improve
  the accuracy of their predictions. Both approaches have their advantages. The active
  measurement approach may be more accurate, while the geolocation database approach
  is not intrusive and can answer queries quickly, even when off-line. This paper
  presents Alidade, a geolocation database system that makes extensive use of available
  network measurement data, but does not issue any probes of its own, either before
  or after a target is presented. Like other geolocation databases, Alidade precomputes
  location estimates for all of IP space. Indeed, using the available constraints,
  Alidade computes a joint solution for all addresses. We demonstrate that Alidade
  is competitive with the best commercial systems -- on their own terms -- using six
  different ground-truth data sets. Alidade also provides stronger guarantees of correctness,
  and each of Alidades predictions consists of a geographical region in addition to
  a representative point.

ABS: The advantage of graph-based anomaly detection is that the relationships between
  elements can be analyzed for structural oddities that could represent activities
  such as fraud, network intrusions, or suspicious associations in a social network.
  Traditionally, methods for discovering anomalies have ignored information about
  the relationships between people, e.g., who they know, or who they call. One approach
  to handling such data is to use a graph representation and detect normative patterns
  and anomalies in the graph. However, current approaches to detecting anomalies in
  graphs are computationally expensive and do not scale to large graphs. In this work,
  we describe methods for scalable graph-based anomaly detection via graph partitioning
  and windowing, and demonstrate its ability to efficiently detect anomalies in data
  represented as a graph.

ABS: For the internet to be sustainable for rapidly increasing traffic, each ISP must
  improve its network equipment in response to this increase in traffic. For this
  improvement, ISPs require a sufficient level of economic utility, which is derived
  from network interconnections. However, the evolution of the internet topology may
  degrade economic utility of each ISP because the traffic flow changes with the evolution
  of the internet topology. In this study, we first investigate whether each ISP can
  obtain sufficient economic utility with an increase in traffic. From this investigation,
  we show that the increase in the rate of traffic through each ISP greatly outstrips
  the increased economic utility of each ISP. This means that the internet topology
  is not sustainable for such an increase in traffic. We then develop policies by
  which autonomous systems can construct links such that each ISP continually achieves
  sufficient economic utility for increase in traffic.

ABS: Traffic analysis and traffic abnormality detection are emerged as an efficient
  way of detecting network attacks in recent years. The existing approaches can be
  improved by introducing a new model and a new analysis method of network users traffic
  behaviors. The description dimensions to network users traffic behaviors in the
  current approaches are high, resulting in high processing complexity, high delay
  in differentiating an individual users abnormal traffic behavior from massive network
  data, and low detection rate. To improve the detection rate and efficiency, we develop
  a new method of establishing users traffic behavior analysis system based on a new
  model of network traffic monitoring. First, we establish a more complete feature
  set based on the characteristics of network traffic to describe massive network
  users behaviors. Then, we define a feature selection rule based on the relative
  deviation distance to select the optimized feature set. We use the selected feature
  set to locate the abnormality moment and the users who produce the abnormal traffic
  behavior. Finally, a traffic behavior analysis method based on prediction is developed
  to improve efficiency of the system. This new method is applied to evaluate the
  mobile users on mobile cloud. The experimental results show that the proposed method
  has a higher detection rate and lower delay in the analysis of abnormal users traffic
  behavior than that of the existing approaches.

ABS: It is long known attackers may use forged source IP address to conceal their
  real locations. To capture the spoofers, a number of IP traceback mechanisms have
  been proposed. However, due to the challenges of deployment, there has been not
  a widely adopted IP traceback solution, at least at the Internet level. As a result,
  the mist on the locations of spoofers has never been dissipated till now. This paper
  proposes passive IP traceback (PIT) that bypasses the deployment difficulties of
  IP traceback techniques. PIT investigates Internet Control Message Protocol error
  messages (named path backscatter) triggered by spoofing traffic, and tracks the
  spoofers based on public available information (e.g., topology). In this way, PIT
  can find the spoofers without any deployment requirement. This paper illustrates
  the causes, collection, and the statistical results on path backscatter, demonstrates
  the processes and effectiveness of PIT, and shows the captured locations of spoofers
  through applying PIT on the path backscatter data set. These results can help further
  reveal IP spoofing, which has been studied for long but never well understood. Though
  PIT cannot work in all the spoofing attacks, it may be the most useful mechanism
  to trace spoofers before an Internet-level traceback system has been deployed in
  real.

ABS: Wireless networks are increasingly overwhelmed by Distributed Denial of Service

  communication resources of a victims mobile device within a very short period of

  making to stunt such attacks. We propose a distributed intrusion detection system
  called Cooperative IDS to protect wireless nodes within the network and target nodes
  from DDoS attacks by using a Cooperative Fuzzy Q-learning (Co-FQL) optimization
  algorithmic technique to identify the attack patterns and take appropriate countermeasures.
  The Co-FQL algorithm was trained and tested to establish its performance by generating
  attacks from the NSL-KDD and CAIDA DDoS Attack 2007 datasets during the simulation

ABS: In traditional approach, extracting important features for the application to

  of switch handling. Furthermore, high volumes of network traffic introduce notable
  issues that affect the performance and anomaly detection accuracy. Taking advantage
  of centralized control plane of Software Defined Networking (SDN), the task to handle
  the flow information is much more simplified programmatically. The accuracy of the
  measured flow statistic play important role in anomaly detection. While the use
  of sampling is capable to lessen the scalability problem of traffic monitoring,
  the insufficiency of sampled flow statistic may led to inaccurate detection rate
  of anomaly. In this paper, we propose an adaptive sampling strategy that is able
  to provide essential traffic statistics for accurate anomaly detection in SDN. Our
  sampling mechanism utilizes the clustering analysis, which is used to classify the
  attack in the network to determine the severity of monitored traffic. By manipulating
  the type of service of incoming packet together, these two important parameter formulate

ABS: Over the last few decades, the Internet ecosystem has been continuously evolving
  to meet the demands of its ever-increasing user base. Drastic changes in the Internet
  infrastructure have improved its capacity and throughput performance, enabling a
  wealth of new services. For Internet Service Providers (ISPs), anticipating and
  accommodating the rapidly shifting traffic demands has been a technological, economical,
  and political challenge. Thus far, this challenge has been met in an organic fashion,
  for the most part, based on unilateral actions of many different players such as
  ISPs, content providers, public policy makers, international organizations, and
  large enterprises. This symbiotic relationship among many and often competing change
  factors has led to a system of enormous complexity that was not a product of well-founded
  engineering principles. Despite the continuous efforts of the scientific and enterprise
  communities to discover and to model the Internet, understanding its structure remains
  a hard challenge. In this thesis, we provide a new perspective on the Internets
  evolutionary pat- terns at the Autonomous System (AS) level. While many studies
  have focused on the mathematical models that express the growth of the AS graph
  topology as a whole, little research has been performed to correlate this growth
  with geographic, economic, and political data, as well as related business interests.
  We divide the Internet to five distinct regions using the well-established Internet
  registry classification and show that the structural properties and evolutionary
  patterns differ from region to region. We further analyze the business relationships
  that dominate each region, as well relationships between regions. Conclusions from
  our analysis is used to explain global as well as local Internet structure phenomena.

  in domains such as finance, networking, security. Examples of such continuously
  streaming data include internet traffic data, sensor readings, tweets, stock market
  data, telecommunication records. As a result, processing and analyzing data to derive
  useful insights from them in real time is becoming increasingly important. The goal
  of my research is to propose techniques to effectively find aggregates and patterns
  from massive distributed data stream in real time. In many real world applications,
  there may be specific user requirements for analyzing data. We consider three different
  user requirements for our work - Sliding window, Distributed data stream, and a
  Union of historical and streaming data. We aim to address the following problems
  in our research : First, we present a detailed experimental evaluation of streaming
  algorithms over sliding window for distinct counting, which is a fundamental aggregation
  problem widely applied in database query optimization and network monitoring. Next,
  we present the first communication-efficient distributed algorithm for tracking
  persistent items in a distributed data stream over both infinite and sliding window.
  We present theoretical analysis on communication cost and accuracy, and provide
  experimental results to validate the guarantees. Finally, we present the design
  and evaluation of a low cost algorithm that identifies quantiles from a union of
  historical and streaming data with improved accuracy.'

TITLE: Route leak detection using real-time analytics on local BGP information

ABS: 'A route leak can be defined as a security gap that occurs due to the infringement
  of the routing policies that any two Autonomous Systems (ASes) have agreed upon.
  Route leaks are seemingly simple, but hard to resolve since the ASes keep their
  routing policies confidential. Indeed, the traditional palliatives, such as the
  utilization of route filters, are no longer used by a large number of ASes, given
  the high administrative burden that they entail. Other alternatives, like BGP monitoring
  tools, not only require third party information gathered at multiple vantage points,
  but also they become impotent in many cases, due to their limited view of the interdomain
  routing state. In this paper, we propose a different approach, which allows to autonomously
  detect the occurrence of route leaks by solely inspecting the BGP information available
  at the AS. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows. First, we propose
  a self-contained Route Leak Detection (RLD) technique, which is based on real-time
  analytics on the Route Information Bases (RIBs) of the border routers of an AS.
  Second, we introduce Benign Fool Back (BFB), a harmless bluff that can substantially
  improve the success rate of the RLD technique. Third, we show through exhaustive
  simulations that our technique can detect route leak incidents in various scenarios
  with high success rate. In addition, our solution has the following practical advantages:
  a) no reliance on third party information (e.g., on vantage points); b) no changes
  required to control-plane protocols (e.g., to BGP); and c) allows non-invasive integration
  (e.g., using SDN).'

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are a serious threat to network
  security. Servers of many companies and/or governments have been victims of such
  attacks. DDoS attacks jam the network service of the target using multiple bots
  hijacked by crackers and send numerous packets to the target server. In such an
  attack, detecting the crackers is extremely difficult, because they only send a
  command by multiple bots from another network and then leave the bots quickly after
  command execute. Therefore, we need an intelligent detection system for DDoS attacks
  to defend network services. To develop the system, we utilized machine learning
  techniques to study the patterns of DDoS attacks and detect them. We analyzed large
  numbers of network packets provided by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis,
  and detected some important patterns that affect the accuracy of the detection system.
  We implemented the detection system using the patterns of DDoS attacks. A support
  vector machine with the radial basis function (Gaussian) kernel is its core part.
  The detection system is accurate in detecting DDoS attacks.

ABS: There is an increasing consensus that the locator/identifier separation of IP
  address is necessary to resolve the scalability issues of current Internet routing
  architecture. After identifiers are separated from locators, an identifier-to-locator
  mapping service must be employed to map identifiers onto locators. From this point,
  this paper proposes an anomaly detection and response approach based on mapping
  requests. By using the cumulative sum algorithm for change point detection, this
  approach introduces the anomalous traffic detection of mapping requests to diagnose
  the aberrant network behaviors. Once alarming, two effective response methods can
  be chosen to control the anomalous attack traffic in real time. Furthermore, in
  order to decouple the mapping request traffic from the mapping cache, this approach
  not only takes into account the mapping cache timeout but also puts forward a practical
  mapping request threshold algorithm. In particular, our simulation results show
  that, compared with the anomaly detection approach based on network traffic, the
  proposed approach is more advantageous and efficient. In addition, we also discuss
  the possible false positive and false negative problems, which may be caused by
  some accidental phenomena.

ABS: The amount of spatio-temporal data produced everyday has sky rocketed in the
  recent years due to the commercial GPS systems and smart devices. Together with
  this, the need for tools and techniques to analyze this kind of data have also increased.
  A major task of spatio-temporal data analysis is to discover relationships and patterns
  among spatially and temporally scattered events. However, most of the existing visualization
  techniques implement a top-down approach i.e, they require prior knowledge of existing
  patterns. In this dissertation, I present my novel visualization technique called
  Storygraph which supports bottom-up discovery of patterns. Since Storygraph presents
  and integrated view, analysis of events can be done with losing either of time or
  spatial contexts. In addition, Storygraph can handle spatio-temporal uncertainty
  making it ideal for data being extracted from text. In the subsequent chapters,
  I demonstrate the versatility and the effectiveness of the Storygraph along with
  case studies from my published works. Finally, I also talk about edge bundling in
  Storygraph to enhance the aesthetics and improve the readability of Storygraph.

ABS: Path divergence refers to a situation where a path from source to an intermediate
  router on a source to destination path may not be a prefix of the source to destination
  path. Studying path divergence helps us understand various operational characteristics
  of the underlying network. In this paper, we perform an active measurement study
  to observe the magnitude, causes, and types of path divergence in the Internet.
  We observe that most path divergence cases occur due to load balancing routers but
  policy-based inter domain routing practices also contribute to divergence. We also
  observe that most routers causing path divergence are positioned in the backbone
  of the network but routers closer to the sources are causing more number of divergences.
  Our study combined with peering relationship data between neighboring domains can
  also point out potential routing anomaly cases in the inter domain routing process
  in the Internet. Finally, our techniques to trace to intermediate routers can explore
  new IP addresses, routers, Autonomous Systems (ASes) which can potentially help
  enrich topology mapping procedure and infer new peering relationships among ASes.

ABS: Knowing the detailed topology of the Internet at the Autonomous System (AS) level
  is extremely valuable for both researchers and industry when making network policies.
  Although there are many measurement projects and databases that provide this information,
  such as ARK, RETRO, ONO and PeeringDB, they only offer a partial view for analyzing
  end-to-end Internet routing paths and they do not focus on the hidden direct interconnections
  between Access ISPs and Content Providers. In order to address these shortcomings,
  we present Mercury, a web platform focused on the AS-level interconnection between
  content providers and content consumers. Mercury enables users to visualize the
  AS topology, aggregating data from traceroute measurements of participants and AS
  information from several databases. The advantage of Mercury is that it discovers
  how operators connect to other organizations and how content providers organize
  their servers infrastructure (CDN) to reach their target audience. To this end,
  Mercury identifies Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) and AS relationships along an
  Internet path and presents this information via a web site and a built-in API. We
  evaluate its potential probing a dataset of 100 popular web URLs from the major
  Spanish ISPs and we successfully identify many direct interconnections that were
  hidden for other methodologies.

ABS: We present the CB tree, a counting-based self-adjusting binary search tree in
  which, as in splay trees, more-frequently accessed items move closer to the root.
  In a sequential execution, after mm operations of which c(v)c(v) access item vv,
  an access of vv traverses a path of length [(1+logmc(v))O(1+logmc(v)) while doing
  few if any rotations. Unlike the original splay tree, in which each access moves
  the accessed item all the way to the root via a sequence of rotations, accesses
  in a CB tree do very few rotations, specifically [(n+nlogmn)O(n+nlogmn), during
  a sequence of mm operations of which nn are insertions. This is o(1)o(1) (subconstant)
  amortized per operation if m >> nm >> n. We adapt the CB tree into a scalable concurrent
  self-adjusting BST. We show experimentally that the concurrent CB tree scales well
  because it, too, performs few rotations, and therefore self-adjusts without having
  rotations create a bottleneck. Our evaluation shows that the concurrent CB tree
  performs better than existing concurrent search trees on non-uniform access sequences
  derived from real workloads.

ABS: In the light of the mice-elephant phenomenon of the Internet traffic, TCP congestion
  control algorithm shows unfairness against flows of small sizes (small flows). In
  this context, we find it motivating to study the influence of TCPs initial window
  (IW) size on the response times of small flows. In our previous works, we proposed
  a function that determines IW-size for each flow based on its size; through game-theoretic
  analysis as well as experiments on real testbed, we observed that the size-based
  IW function (in comparison to a single constant IW size) shows considerable improvement
  in the performance of small flows, while at the same time not affecting the performance
  of large flows. In this paper, we share the experience of using some important open
  source tools for developing, experimenting and evaluating the proposed IW function.
  We implement the size-based IW function in the Linux kernel, version 3.7.4; we use
  ipfw/Dummynet for emulating links, open source tool called parallel for executing
  the application in parallel for generating TCP traffic, wireshark (along with lua

ABS: While big data is becoming ubiquitous, interest in handling data stream at scale
  is also gaining popularity, which leads to the sprout of many distributed stream
  computing systems. However, complexity of stream computing and diversity of workloads
  expose great challenges to benchmark these systems. Due to lack of standard criteria,
  evaluations and comparisons of these systems tend to be difficult. This paper takes
  an early step towards benchmarking modern distributed stream computing frameworks.
  After identifying the challenges and requirements in the field, we raise our benchmark
  definition Stream Bench regarding the requirements. Stream Bench proposes a message
  system functioning as a mediator between stream data generation and consumption.
  It also covers 7 benchmark programs that intend to address typical stream computing
  scenarios and core operations. Not only does it care about performance of systems
  under different data scales, but also takes fault tolerance ability and durability
  into account, which drives to incorporate four workload suites targeting at these
  various aspects of systems. Finally, we illustrate the feasibility of Stream Bench
  by applying it to two popular frameworks, Apache Storm and Apache Spark Streaming.
  We draw comparisons from various perspectives between the two platforms with workload
  suites of Stream Bench. In addition, we also demonstrate performance improvement
  of Storms latest version with the benchmark.

  the number of attackers that are observed by the telescope, and the number of attacks
  that are observed by the telescope. Characterizing cybersecurity posture therefore
  becomes investigating the phenomena and statistical properties exhibited by these
  time series, and explaining their cybersecurity meanings. For example, we propose
  the concept of {\em sweep-time}, and show that sweep-time should be modeled by stochastic
  process, rather than random variable. We report that the number of attackers (and
  attacks) from a certain country dominates the total number of attackers (and attacks)

ABS: Detecting malicious traffic streams in modern computer networks is a challenging
  task due to the growing traffic volume that must be analyzed. Traditional anomaly
  detection systems based on packet inspection face a scalability problem in terms
  of computational and storage capacity. One solution to this scalability problem
  is to analyze traffic based on IP flow aggregates. However, IP aggregates can still
  result in prohibitively large datasets for networks with heavy traffic loads. In
  this paper, we investigate whether anomaly detection is still possible when traffic
  is aggregated at a coarser scale . We propose a volumetric analysis methodology
  that aggregates traffic at the Autonomous System (AS) level. We show that our methodology
  reduces the number of flows to be analyzed by several orders of magnitude compared
  with IP flow level analysis, while still detecting traffic anomalies.

ABS: 'Large systems of interacting objects are highly prevalent in todays world. In
  this thesis we primarily address such large systems in computer science. We model
  such large systems using mean-field approximation, which allows to compute the limiting
  behaviour of an infinite population of identical objects. This thesis aims at formulating
  and analysing advanced properties of large systems of interacting objects using
  fast, efficient, and accurate algorithms. We propose to apply model-checking techniques
  to mean-field models. This allows (i) defining advanced properties of mean-field
  models, such as survivability, steady-state availability, conditional instantaneous
  availability using logic; and (ii) automatically checking these properties using
  model-checking algorithms. Existing model-checking logics and algorithms cannot
  directly be applied to mean-field models since the model consist of two layers:
  the local level, describing the behaviour of a randomly chosen individual object
  in a large system, and the global level, which addresses the overall system of all
  interacting objects. Therefore, we define two logics, called Mean Field Continuous
  Stochastic Logic (MF-CSL), and Mean-Field Logic (MFL), for describing properties
  of systems composed of many identical interacting objects, on both the local and
  the global level. We present model-checking algorithms for checking both MF-CSL
  and MFL properties, and illustrated these algorithms using an extensive example
  on virus propagation in a computer network. We discuss the differences in the expressiveness
  of these two logics as well as their possible combination. Additionally, we combine
  the mean-field method with parameter fitting techniques in order to model real-world
  large systems, and obtain a better understanding of the behaviour of such systems.
  We explain how to build a mean-field model of the system, and how to estimate the
  corresponding parameter values, so as to find the best fit between the available
  data and the model prediction. To illustrate the approach we estimate the parameter
  values for the outbreak of the real-world computer worm Code-Red. The techniques
  presented in this thesis allow an involved analysis of large systems of interacting
  objects, including (i) obtaining parameter values of mean-field model using measurements;
  (ii) defining advanced properties of the model; and (iii) automatically checking

  traffic captures from a three-week observation period in April, 2012, are used to
  compare the entropy-based classification with the in-depth traffic analysis. Results
  show that several traffic types present a high correlation to the respective traffic-flow

ABS: This paper presents the design and data-driven overhead analysis of PrefiSec,
  a distributed framework that helps collaborating organizations to effectively maintain
  and share network information in the fight against miscreants. PrefiSec is a novel
  distributed IP-prefix-based solution, which maintains information about the activities
  associated with IP prefixes (blocks of IP addresses) and autonomous systems (AS).
  Within PrefiSec, we design and evaluate simple and scalable mechanisms and policies
  that allow participating entities to effectively share network information, which
  helps to protect against prefix/subprefix attacks, interception attacks, and a wide
  range of edge-based attacks, such as spamming, scanning, and botnet activities.
  Timely reporting of such information helps participants improve their security,
  keep their security footprints clean, and incentivizes participation. Public wide-area
  BGP-announcements, traceroutes, and simulations are used to estimate the overhead,

ABS: How pervasive is the vulnerability to link-flooding attacks that degrade connectivity
  of thousands of Internet hosts? Are some geographic regions more vulnerable than
  others? Do practical countermeasures exist? To answer these questions, we introduce
  the notion of the routing bottlenecks and show that it is a fundamental property
  of Internet design; i.e., it is a consequence of route-cost minimizations. We illustrate
  the pervasiveness of routing bottlenecks in an experiment comprising 15 countries
  and 15 cities distributed around the world, and measure their susceptibility to
  scalable link-flooding attacks. We present the key characteristics of routing bottlenecks,
  including size, link type, and distance from host destinations, and suggest specific
  structural and operational countermeasures to link-flooding attacks. These countermeasures
  can be deployed by network operators without needing major Internet redesign.

ABS: Content centric networking (CCN) has attracted a great deal of attention as a
  network that can efficiently deliver content. In CCN, content is delivered using
  the content name, instead of the host IP address, from cache memory implemented
  at routers. The nodes sending content are not explicitly indicated, and content
  is delivered from routers that have copies of content on the routes where the Interest
  packets are transmitted. Therefore, as a result of introducing CCN in ISP networks,
  the pattern of traffic exchanges among ISPs will change considerably. Customer ISPs
  normally pay a transit fee to transit ISPs based on the traffic volume transmitted
  on the transit links. Therefore, the introduction of CCN by ISPs will affect the
  profit of ISPs. CCN is introduced and operated by ISPs based on their business judgment,
  so it is important to estimate how CCN affects ISP profit in order to investigate
  the likelihood of CCN spreading among many ISPs. In this paper, we formalize the
  profit of ISPs when implementing CCN, assuming a hierarchical topology of ISPs in
  three levels and investigate the likelihood of CCN spreading through numerical evaluation.

ABS: 'The Internet at the interdomain level is a complex network of approximately
  50,000 Autonomous Systems (ASes). ASes interconnect through two types of links:
  (a) transit (customer-provider) and (b) peering links. Recent studies have shown
  that despite being optional for most ASes, a rich and dynamic peering fabric exists
  among ASes. Peering has also grown as one of the main instruments for catching up
  with asymmetric traffic due to CDNs, online video traffic, performance requirements,
  etc. Moreover, peering has been in the spotlight recently because of peering conflicts
  between major ISPs and Content Providers. Such conflicts have led to calls for intervention
  by communication regulators and legislation at the highest levels of government.
  Peering disputes have also sometimes resulted in partitioning of the Internet. Despite
  the broad interest and intense debate about peering, several fundamental questions
  remain elusive. The objective of this thesis is to study peering from a techno-economics
  perspective. We explore the following questions: 1- What are the main sources of
  complexity in Internet peering that defy the development of an automated approach
  to assess peering relationships? 2- What is the current state of the peering ecosystem,
  e.g., which categories of ASes are more inclined towards peering? What are the most
  popular peering strategies among ASes in the Internet? 3- What can we say about
  the economics of contemporary peering practices, e.g., what is the impact of using
  different peering traffic ratios as a strategy to choose peers? Is the general notion
  that peering saves network costs, always valid? 4- Can we propose novel methods
  for peering that result in more stable and fair peering interconnections? We have
  used game-theoretic modeling, large-scale computational agent-based modeling, and
  analysis of publicly available peering data to answer the above questions. The main
  contributions of this thesis include: 1- Identification of fundamental complexities
  underlying the evaluation of peers and formation of stable peering links in the
  interdomain network. 2- An empirical study of the state of the peering ecosystem
  from August 2010 to August 2013. 3- Development of a large-scale agent-based computational
  model to study the formation and evolution of Internet peering interconnections.
  4- A plausible explanation for the gravitation of Internet transit providers towards
  Open peering and a prediction of its future consequences. 5- We propose a variant
  of the Open peering policy and a new policy based on cost-benefit analysis to replace
  the contemporary simplistic policies.'

ABS: Detection and preventing Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) becomes
  a crucial process for the commercial organization that using the internet these
  days. Different approaches have been adopted to process traffic information collected
  by a monitoring stations (Routers and Servers) to distinguish the misbehaving of
  malicious traffic of DDoS attacks in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). In general,
  data mining techniques can be designed and implemented with the intrusion systems
  to protect the organizations from malicious. Specifically, unsupervised data mining
  clustering techniques allow to effectively distinguish the normal traffic from malicious
  traffic in a good accuracy. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach called centroid-based
  rules to detect and prevent a real-world DDoS attacks collected from CAIDA UCSD
  DDoS Attack 2007 Dataset and normal traffic traces from CAIDA Anonymized Internet
  Traces 2008 Dataset using unsupervised k-means data mining clustering techniques
  with proactive rules method. Centroid-based rules are used to effectively detect
  the DDoS attack in an efficient time. The Result of experiments shows that the centroid-based
  rules method perform better than the centroid-based method in term of accuracy and
  detection rate. In term of false alarm rates, the proposed solution obtains very
  low false positive rate in the training process and testing phases. Results of accuracy
  were more than 99% in training and testing processes. The proposed centroid-based
  rules method can be used in a real-time monitoring as DDoS defense system.

ABS: We propose a novel visualization, IMap, which enables the detection of security
  threats by visualizing a large volume of dynamic network data. In IMap, the Internet
  topology at the Autonomous System (AS) level is represented by a canonical map (which
  resembles a geographic map of the world), and aggregated IP traffic activity is
  superimposed in the form of heat maps (intensity overlays). Specifically, IMap groups
  ASes as contiguous regions based on AS attributes (geolocation, type, rank, IP prefix
  space) and AS relationships. The area, boundary, and relative positions of these
  regions in the map do not re ect actual world geography, but are determined by the
  characteristics of the Internets AS topology. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
  IMap, we showcase two case studies, a simulated DDoS attack and a real-world worm
  propagation attack.

  cheaper (virtually no overhead) and more accurate available bandwidth estimation.
  MinProbe performs accurately on high capacity networks up to 10 Gbps and with bursty

ABS: Understanding the Internets topological structure continues to be fraught with

  provider infrastructure can be used to effectively guide topology discovery based
  on network layer TTL-limited measurement. The goal of our work is to focus layer
  3-based probing on broadly identifying Internet infrastructure that has a fixed
  geographic location such as POPs, IXPs and other kinds of hosting facilities. We
  begin by comparing more than 1.5 years of TTL-limited probe data from the Ark [25]
  project with maps of service provider infrastructure from the Internet Atlas [15]
  project. We find that there are substantially more nodes and links identified in
  the service provider map data versus the probe data. Next, we describe a new method
  for probe-based measurement of physical infrastructure called POPsicle that is based
  on careful selection of probe source-destination pairs. We demonstrate the capability
  of our method through an extensive measurement study using existing looking glass
  vantage points distributed throughout the Internet and show that it reveals 2.4
  times more physical node locations versus standard probing methods. To demonstrate
  the deployability of POPsicle we also conduct tests at an IXP. Our results again
  show that POPsicle can identify more physical node locations compared with standard
  layer 3 probes, and through this deployment approach it can be used to measure thousands
  of networks world wide.

ABS: Bloom-filter-based forwarding has been suggested to solve several fundamental
  problems in the current Internet, such as routing-table growth, multicast scalability
  issues, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by botnets. The proposed protocols are
  source-routed and include the delivery tree encoded as a Bloom filter in each packet.
  The network nodes forward packets based on this in-packet information without consulting
  routing tables and without storing per-flow state. We show that these protocols
  have critical vulnerabilities and make several false security assumptions. In particular,
  we present DoS attacks against broad classes of Bloom-filter-based protocols and
  conclude that the protocols are not ready for deployment on open networks. The results
  also help us understand the limitations and design options for Bloom-filter forwarding.

GEOLOC: Chung Li City, TW
ABS: Since adversaries may spoof their source IPs in the attacks, traceback schemes
  have been proposed to identify the attack source. However, some of these schemes
  storage requirements increase with packet numbers. Some even have false positives
  because they use an IP headers fragment offset for marking. Thus, we propose a 16-bit
  single packet hybrid IP traceback scheme that combines packet marking and packet
  logging with high accuracy and low storage requirement. The size of our log tables
  can be bounded by route numbers. We also set a threshold to determine whether an
  upstream interface number is stored in a log table or in a marking field, so as
  to balance the logging frequency and our computational loads. Because we store user
  interface information on small-degree routers, compared with current single packet
  traceback schemes, ours can have the lowest storage requirements. Besides, our traceback
  achieves zero false positive/negative rates and guarantees reassembly of fragmented
  packets at the destination.

ABS: The Internet has significantly expanded in recent years, both in the number of
  networks (Autonomous Systems, ASs) it incorporates and in the number of IP prefixes
  (blocks of addresses) that have been assigned to those networks. According to current
  routing operational practices, every assigned IP prefix has to be propagated to
  all the ASs, and this puts a heavy burden on the Internets routing system. This
  thesis studies the Internet routing scalability problem, using route aggregation
  to reduce the state information that ASs need to maintain and exchange with other
  ASs without compromising the quality of the AS-paths traversed by the data packets.
  Route aggregation purports to judiciously substitute sets of routes pertaining to
  long IP prefixes by single routes pertaining to a shorter IP prefix which summarizes
  the address space of the long IP prefixes. We first analyze the current state of
  the routing system, collecting several statistics concerning the Internet topology,
  business relationships between ASs, and prefix assignments. Then, we present a class
  of distributed route aggregation strategies, accommodating different varieties of
  routing policies and different stages of partial deployment. Lastly, we assess the
  efficiency of that class of route aggregation strategies for realistic Internet
  topologies, business relationships, and prefix assignments. Our experiments show
  that route aggregation reduces the size of the Internets forwarding tables by approximately
  78%.

ABS: Understanding, measuring, and debugging IP networks, particularly across administrative
  domains, is challenging. One particularly daunting aspect of the challenge is the
  presence of transparent middleboxes---which are now common in todays Internet. In-path
  middleboxes that modify packet headers are typically transparent to a TCP, yet can
  impact end-to-end performance or cause blackholes. We develop TCP HICCUPS to reveal
  packet header manipulation to both endpoints of a TCP connection. HICCUPS permits
  endpoints to cooperate with currently opaque middleboxes without prior knowledge
  of their behavior. For example, with visibility into end-to-end behavior, a TCP
  can selectively enable or disable performance enhancing options. This cooperation
  enables protocol innovation by allowing new IP or TCP functionality (e.g., ECN,
  SACK, Multipath TCP, Tcpcrypt) to be deployed without fear of such functionality
  being misconstrued, modified, or blocked along a path. HICCUPS is incrementally
  deployable and introduces no new options. We implement and deploy TCP HICCUPS across
  thousands of disparate Internet paths, highlighting the breadth and scope of subtle
  and hard to detect middlebox behaviors encountered. We then show how path diagnostic
  capabilities provided by HICCUPS can benefit applications and the network.

ABS: 'The persistent spread of a destination host is the number of distinct sources
  that have contacted it persistently in predefined t measurement periods. A persistent
  spread estimator is a software/hardware component on a router that inspects the
  arrival packets and estimates the persistent spread of each destination. This is
  a new primitive for network measurement that can be used to detect long-term stealthy
  malicious activities, which cannot be recognized by the traditional super spreader
  detectors that are designed only for elephant activities. However, the challenge
  is to function such an estimator in fast but small memory space (such as on-chip
  SRAM of line cards), in order to keep up with the high speed of switching fabric
  for packet forwarding. This paper presents an implementation that can use very tight
  memory space to deliver high estimation accuracy: Its memory expense is less than
  one bit per flow element in each time period, Its estimation accuracy is over 90%
  better than a continuous variant of Flajolet-Martin sketches, Its operating range
  to produce effective measurements is hundreds of times broader than the traditional
  bitmap. These advantages originate from a new data structure called multi-virtual
  bitmap, which is designed to estimate the cardinality of the intersection of an
  arbitrary number of sets. We have verified the effectiveness of our new estimator

ABS: Multiple schemes that utilize Probabilistic Packet Marking (PPM) have been proposed
  to deal with Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks by reconstructing their
  attack graphs and identifying the attack sources. By analyzing a set of PPM-based
  schemes, we show that past researchers have evaluated the schemes using disparate
  and often inadequate underlying topologies, which makes a side-by-side comparison
  of the scheme performance a complex problem. To tackle this problem, we evaluate
  selected schemes on a large set of Internet-like topologies and adapt the network
  motif approach to provide a common ground for comparing the schemes performances
  in different network topologies. This approach allows us to determine the level
  of structural similarity between network topologies and consequently enables the
  comparison of scheme performance even when the schemes are implemented on different
  topologies. Our results reveal that both the value of the PPM-based schemes convergence
  times, and their rankings vary depending on the underlying network topology. However
  the variation is considerably less when the topologies are compared within superfamilies
  of structural similarity. More specifically, the standard deviation in convergence
  times across the networks drops to about a tenth of its original value when the
  set of 28 networks are arranged in four superfamilies. To complement our results,
  we present an analytical model showing a link between scheme performance in any
  superfamily, and the motifs exhibited by the networks in that superfamily. Our work
  proposes an effective way of comparing general network protocol performance in which
  the protocol is evaluated on specific representative networks instead of an entire
  set of networks.

ABS: A lot of applications depend on reliable and stable Internet connectivity. These
  characteristics are crucial for mission-critical services such as telemedical applications.  An
  important factor that can affect connection availability is the convergence time
  of BGP, the de-facto inter-domain routing (IDR) protocol in the Internet. After
  a routing change, it may take several minutes until the network converges and BGP
  routing becomes stable again [13]. Kotronis et al. [8,9] propose a novel Internet
  routing approach based on SDN principles that combines several Autonomous Systems
  (AS) into groups, called clusters, and introduces a logically centralized routing
  decision process for the cluster participants. One of the goals of this concept
  is to stabilize the IDR system and bring down its convergence time. However, testing
  whether such approaches can improve on BGP problems requires hybrid SDN and BGP
  experimentation tools that can emulate multiple ASes. Presently, there is a lack
  of an easy to use public tool for this purpose. This work fills this gap by building
  a suitable emulation framework and evaluating the effect that a proof-of-concept
  IDR controller has on IDR convergence time.

  primarily in the rapid growth of IP packet forwarding tables. The forwarding table,
  implemented at the data plane fast path of Internet routers to drive the packet
  forwarding process, currently contains about half a million entries and counting.
  Meanwhile, it needs to support millions of complex queries and updates per second.
  In this paper, we make the curious observation that the entropy of IP forwarding
  tables is very small and, what is more, seems to increase at a lower pace than the
  size of the network. This suggests that a sophisticated compression scheme may effectively
  and persistently reduce the memory footprint of IP forwarding tables, shielding
  operators from scalability matters at least temporarily. Our main contribution is
  such a compression scheme which, for the first time, admits both the required information-theoretical
  size bounds and attains fast lookups, thanks to aggressive level compression. Although
  we find the underlying optimization problem NP-complete, we can still give a lightweight
  heuristic algorithm with firm approximation guarantees. This allows us to squeeze
  real IP forwarding tables, comprising almost 500, 000 prefixes, to just about 140-200
  KBytes of memory within a factor of 2-3 of the entropy bound, so that forwarding
  decisions take only 8-10 memory accesses on average and updates are supported efficiently.
  Our compression scheme may be of more general interest, as it is applicable to essentially
  any prefix tree.

ABS: In order to detect and prevent DoS/DDoS attacks that exploit IP address spoofing,
  the IP traceback technique has been introduced and developed with variety of methods
  including packet marking. By means of inserting marking information on the travel
  path into rarely used fields in the header of IP packets, the destination host can
  trace back the original-source location of received packets, which is useful for
  supporting detection of attacks. Many schemes of packet marking IP traceback have
  been proposed, but still have nevertheless some drawbacks such as low traceback
  rate, heavy computational overhead due to high-required number of marked packets
  and marking size. In this paper, we proposed PLA DFM, a novel efficient enhanced
  solution of Deterministic Flow Marking based on adaptation with real traffic characteristics.
  The analytic result shows that the proposed solution provides a far higher successful
  mark rate, lower computational overhead compared to the original scheme and other
  marking techniques with unnoticeable increased traffic size.

ABS: Energy efficient router is one of the most important and promising devices in
  the roadmap towards green communication and networking. In recent years, automatical
  power scaling adapting with real-time network traffic in a router has been proved
  to be practical on real hardware, which is an implementation under the traffic aware
  philosophy. In this paper, we further explore this direction, and present four real-time
  power scaling algorithms for the fine-grained energy management within a router.
  These algorithms are all based on the traffic aware philosophy. We first classify
  the traffic characteristics into three categories of the core router, access router
  and home router and analyze the differences among them. Then, we propose two design
  methodologies, periodical scaling and threshold scaling, and address four algorithms
  in details. Finally, we use real network traffic to evaluate these algorithms and
  draw the conclusions. The experiments on real traffic show that more than 40% of
  the energy in a router can be saved by using proposed system-level power scaling
  methods. Based on those evaluations, we also find that three status modes with two
  working frequencies and a sleep in a router are enough to achieve near-optimal energy
  efficiency by using our algorithms, which indicates an easy and practical hardware
  modification.

ABS: 'Malware attacks are increasingly popular attack vectors in online crime. As
  trends and anecdotal evidence show, preventing these attacks, regardless of their
  opportunistic or targeted nature, has proven difficult: intrusions happen and devices
  get compromised, even at security-conscious organisations. As a consequence, an
  alternative line of work has focused on detecting and disrupting the individual
  steps that follow an initial compromise and that are essential for the successful
  progression of the attack. In particular, a number of approaches and techniques
  have been proposed to identify the Command and Control (C2) channel that a compromised
  system establishes to communicate with its controller. The success of C2 detection
  approaches depends on collecting relevant network traffic. As traffic volumes increase
  this is proving increasingly difficult. In this paper, we analyse current approaches
  of ISP-scale network measurement from the perspective of C2 detection. We discuss
  a number of weaknesses that affect current techniques and provide suggestions for
  their improvement.'

  identify the Time Periods of Change (TPC) associated with CoIn. We present experimental

ABS: Having dedicated the previous chapter to the second level of SA, we now proceed
  to the third level. The highest level of SA projection involves envisioning how
  the current situation may evolve into the future situation and the anticipation
  of the future elements of the situation. In the context of CSA, particularly important
  is the projection of future cyber attacks, or future phases of an ongoing cyber
  attack. Attacks often take a long time and involve multitudes of reconnaissance,
  exploitations, and obfuscation activities to achieve the goal of cyber espionage
  or sabotage. The anticipation of future attack actions is generally derived from
  the presently observed malicious activities. This chapter reviews the existing state-of-the-art
  techniques for network attack projection, and then explains how the estimates of
  ongoing attack strategies can then be used to provide a prediction of likely upcoming
  threats to critical assets of the network.

GEOLOC: Vienna, AT
ABS: An IP darkspace is an unused IP address range. Addresses are announced by routing,
  but no hosts are attached. Therefore all traffic directed to IP darkspace addresses
  is unsolicited and usually originates from attacks, attack preparation activities
  or misconfigurations. Most of the observed traffic belongs to known phenomena (e.g.
  horizontal scanning targeting a specific port) and is of limited interest to security
  analysts. But hidden in the vast amount of common attacks, smaller unusual events
  may indicate new malicious activities. In this paper we present a methodology to
  distinguish IP darkspace sources with common traffic patterns from sources that
  show uncommon behavior and may be the origin of novel attacks. For this, we model
  IP darkspace sources based on clustering techniques. We extract data from one complete
  month of a large /8 darkspace capture and use a very simple feature vector. Our
  analysis is purely based on clustering techniques and does not require any pre-knowledge
  about phenomena in darkspace traffic. We found that about 75% of the darkspace IP
  sources contributes to a set of very stable clusters, 4% to less stable clusters
  and 21% to outliers. This allows us to concentrate the effort for searching for
  new attacks in just 21% of the sources.

ABS: The Internet is a system-of-system composed of devices and networking technologies
  operated by autonomous systems (AS). The linking decisions made by ASes affect the
  topology and thereby the performance of the Internet. The objective in this paper
  is to estimate AS linking preferences and behaviors in the evolution of the AS-level
  Internet using discrete choice models (DCM). The proposed approach utilities the
  observable Internet topology as the input to estimate preferences  and behaviors
  of ASes by considering not only the network metrics but also the geographic and
  economic aspects, role and provider-customer relationships. The approach provides
  a way to quantify the impact of different variables on the linking probabilities.
  The results show that a) the geographic in the AS linking behaviors and b) heterogeneity
  in the linking preferences of ASes is important for accurate characterization of
  AS linking behaviors. The uniqueness of the proposed approach is that it provides
  an interpretation of AS decisions through the lens of utility-maximization principles.
  The approach can help in developing improved decision?aking models for AS-level

ABS: Due to potentially complex relationships among heterogeneous data sets, recent
  research efforts have involved the representation of this type of complex data as
  a graph. For instance, in the case of computer network traffic, a graph representation
  of the traffic might consist of nodes representing computers and edges representing
  communications between the corresponding computers. However, computer network traffic
  is typically voluminous, or acquired in real-time as a stream of information. In
  previous work on static graphs, we have used a compression-based measure to find
  normative patterns, and then analyzed the close matches to the normative patterns
  to indicate potential anomalies. However, while our approach has demonstrated its
  effectiveness in a variety of domains, the issue of scalability has limited this
  approach when dealing with domains containing millions of nodes and edges. To address
  this issue, we propose a novel approach called Pattern Learning and Anomaly Detection
  on Streams, or PLADS, that is not only scalable to real-world data that is streaming,
  but also maintains reasonable levels of effectiveness in detecting anomalies. In
  this paper we present a partitioning and windowing approach that partitions the
  graph as it streams in over time and maintains a set of normative patterns and anomalies.
  We then empirically evaluate our approach using publicly available network data
  as well as a dataset that represents e-commerce traffic.

ABS: One of the applications of network traffic monitoring is to detect anomalies
  and security threats. Due to the huge number of packets that traverse networks,
  monitoring is typically implemented by sampling the traffic. Sampling can be done
  per packet or per flow. For flow sampling, the decision to select a flow can be
  purely random or based on some properties of the flows. In thislater case, each
  incoming packet has to be compared against the set of flows being monitored to determine
  if the packet belongs to any of those flows. This matching can be implemented using
  a content addressable memory (CAM) or hash based data structures. Among those, one
  option is Cuckoo hashing that provides good memory utilization and a deterministic
  worst number of memory accesses. However, in the case of flow sampling, most packets
  will not belong to any of the flows being monitored. Therefore, all tables will
  be accessed and the worst case number of accesses will be required thus reducing
  throughput. In this letter, a technique to reduce the average number of accesses
  to search for items that are not stored in the Cuckoo hash is proposed and evaluated.
  The results show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the average number
  of accesses in a flow sampling application. This means that the technique can be
  used to increase the throughput substantially.

ABS: 'To debug reachability problems, a network operator often asks operators of other

  the exchange of data plane reachability information between networks in a business
  relationship. A network deploys COVE in a host (its local verifier) which can construct
  both forward and reverse reachability trees in the Internet data plane for the networks
  provider/customer cone. Each edge in a tree is annotated by a set of packets that
  can traverse the edge. COVE was designed with partial deployment in mind. Reachable
  networks that do not deploy COVE are leaf nodes in reachability trees. Partial trees
  are useful. We constructed an Internet dataset of 2,649 ASes and performed experiments
  in which up to 170 workstations ran COVE as local verifiers to construct forward
  and reverse provider (also customer) trees for ASes. The results of these experiments
  demonstrate scalability of COVE to very large ASes in the Internet. We illustrate
  applications of COVE to solve the following network management problems: evaluating
  inbound load balancing policies, what-if analysis before adding a new provider,
  finding additional paths, configuring default routes as backup, black hole detection,

  legacy Remote Triggered Black-Hole (RTBH) routing approach, towards Distributed
  Denial of Service (DDoS) attack mitigation. More specifically, we exploit the network
  programmability of OpenFlow to match and handle traffic on a per-flow level, in
  order to preserve normal operation of the victim, while pushing the mitigation process
  upstream towards the edge of the network. To this end, we implemented and evaluated
  a sketch-based anomaly detection and identification mechanism, capable of pinpointing
  the victim and remotely triggering the mitigation of the offending network traffic.
  The evaluation is based on the combination of datasets containing real DDoS attacks
  and normal background traffic from an operational university campus network. Our
  results demonstrated that the proposed approach succeeds in identifying the victim
  of the attack and efficiently filtering the malicious sources.

ABS: Nowadays, many companies and/or governments require a secure system and/or an
  accurate intrusion detection system (IDS) to defend their network services and the
  users private information. In network security, developing an accurate detection
  system for distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is one of challenging tasks.
  DDoS attacks jam the network service of the target using multiple bots hijacked
  by crackers and send numerous packets to the target server. Servers of many companies
  and/or governments have been victims of the attacks. In such an attack, detecting
  the crackers is extremely difficult, because they only send a command by multiple
  bots from another network and then leave the bots quickly after command execute.
  The proposed strategy is to develop an intelligent detection system for DDoS attacks
  by detecting patterns of DDoS attack using network packet analysis and utilizing
  machine learning techniques to study the patterns of DDoS attacks. In this study,
  we analyzed large numbers of network packets provided by the Center for Applied
  Internet Data Analysis and implemented the detection system using a support vector
  machine with the radial basis function (Gaussian) kernel. The detection system is
  accurate in detecting DDoS attacks.

GEOLOC: Hong Kong, CN
ABS: The settlement-free peering relationships play a vital role in todays Internet,
  notably in helping ISPs cope with the dramatic increase in traffic load caused by
  the recent surge in the demand for videos and user generated content. Because of
  the added caching capability of CCN, peering in CCN can be expanded to encompass
  not only content that is permanently stored in the ISPs network, but also content
  that is temporarily cached at CCN routers in the ISPs network. Intuitively, this
  content-level peering is likely to benefit the networks involved in the peering
  relationship; however, this comes at a non-trivial cost. In this paper, we try to
  answer the question of whether the additional overhead and complexity to extend
  content-level peering is justifiable in view of the benefits it brings. To this
  end, we formulate the content-level peering problem as an optimization problem to
  study its maximum potential benefit. We conduct extensive numerical experiments
  to evaluate the potential peering benefit under realistic AS-level peering graphs,
  using realistic video traffic. The experimental results show that the interconnectivity
  of the peering graph significantly affects the maximum benefit of content-level
  peering. Compared to local greedy caching, cooperative caching can bring higher
  peering benefits; yet it is sensitive to parameters like the peering link bandwidth
  and the AS-level cache size.

ABS: The results of botnet detection methods are usually presented without any comparison.
  Although it is generally accepted that more comparisons with third-party methods
  may help to improve the area, few papers could do it. Among the factors that prevent
  a comparison are the difficulties to share a dataset, the lack of a good dataset,
  the absence of a proper description of the methods and the lack of a comparison
  methodology. This paper compares the output of three different botnet detection
  methods by executing them over a new, real, labeled and large botnet dataset. This
  dataset includes botnet, normal and background traffic. The results of our two methods
  (BClus and CAMNEP) and BotHunter were compared using a methodology and a novel error

  indeed helps to better estimate how good the methods are, to improve the algorithms,
  to build better datasets and to build a comparison methodology.

ABS: The position of the nodes within a network topology largely determines the level
  of their involvement in various networking functions. Yet numerous node centrality
  indices, proposed to quantify how central individual nodes are in this respect,
  yield very different views of their relative significance. Our first contribution
  is then an exhaustive survey and categorization of centrality indices along several
  attributes including the type of information (local vs. global) and processing complexity
  required for their computation. We next study the seven most popular of those indices
  in the context of Internet vulnerability to address issues that remain under-explored
  in literature so far. First, we carry out a correlation study to assess the consistency
  of the node rankings those indices generate over ISP router-level topologies. For
  each pair of indices, we compute the full ranking correlation, which is the standard
  choice in literature, and the percentage overlap between the k top nodes. Then,
  we let these rankings guide the removal of highly central nodes and assess the impact
  on both the connectivity properties and traffic-carrying capacity of the network.
  Our results confirm that the top-k overlap predicts the comparative impact of indices
  on the network vulnerability better than the full-ranking correlation. Importantly,
  the locally computed degree centrality index approximates closely the global indices
  with the most dramatic impact on the traffic-carrying capacity; whereas, its approximative
  power in terms of connectivity is more topology-dependent.

ABS: Protection of critical information infrastructure is a major task for the network
  security experts in any part of the globe. There are certain threats that will never
  evade away despite sophisticated advancements in defense strategy. Among them, Distributed
  Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have witnessed continual growth in scale, frequency
  and intensity. The impact of DDoS attacks can be devastating such that it creates
  severe ripples to the cyberworld. Nowadays, attackers are advancing towards different
  variants of DDoS attacks to escape from the detection mechanisms. In this paper,
  a new DDoS Detection system is proposed. Initially, wavelet based features are extracted
  and classified using semi-supervised learning to detect the DDoS attacks. Different
  wavelet families are studied and the combination of them seems to be robust and
  efficient and hence used as features. Machine learning algorithms are highly appreciated
  in many classification problems. There is a considerable demand for labeled dataset
  and hence to bridge the gap between them and unlabeled dataset, semi-supervised
  learning algorithm is employed to classify the attack from normal traffic. Extensive
  analysis is performed by conducting experiments and by using real-time dataset.
  Results obtained are convincing and hence can be modeled for real-time approach.

ABS: 'The hierarchy of Internet peering and transit interconnection agreements between
  Internet Service Providers (ISPs) defines the core economic structure of the Internet.
  Recent interconnection agreements (e.g., between Netflix and ATT, Comcast or Verizon)
  have generated considerable comment and concern, much of which is misleading as
  to the root causes for new peering agreements and even the future of the Internet
  itself. Given this critical setting, this paper examines how and why Internet peering
  and transit is changing, and discusses the implications of these changes on the
  future evolution of the Internet. What makes this research novel is the analysis
  of new Internet traffic data to identify future trends relevant to Internet interconnection.
  These data provide insight into the congestion level of different interconnects
  in a few places on the Internet. We next develop a framework to describe past evolution
  in Internet Interconnection in order to better understand the changing characteristics
  in Internet traffic, and other new developments impacting the economics of Internet
  interconnection. This framework demonstrates how most network providers have been
  progressively expanding their networks over a larger proportion of the end-to-end
  connection (i.e., increasing their network investment), providing an explanation
  of the changes in Internet interconnection, and resulting controversies, to keep
  pace with this network evolution. The strategic implications of our analysis: 1)
  a more complete understanding of the full network investment undertaken by network
  providers may help avoid, or at least better explain, the future controversies,
  2) rapidly changing nature of Internet content will be constant source of change
  in interconnection, and 3) the changing role of Tier 1 providers will be further
  impacted by increasing peering among Tier 2 and Tier 3 providers through the implementation
  of remote peering based upon open standards for Internet Exchange Providers. Taken
  as a whole, the increasingly overlapping roles of network providers call into question
  the utility of the traditional Tiered framework as a useful description of the current
  Internet peering ecosystem, and suggests the need for a new, updated framework to
  predict and describe future peering relationships.'

ABS: Invasion by Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a serious threat to services
  offered on the Internet. A low-rate DDoS attack allows legitimate network traffic
  to pass and consumes low bandwidth. So, detection of this type of attacks is very
  difficult in high speed networks. Information theory is popular because it allows
  quantifications of the difference between malicious traffic and legitimate traffic
  based on probability distributions. In this paper, we empirically evaluate several
  information metrics, namely, Hartley entropy, Shannon entropy, Renyis entropy and
  Generalized entropy in their ability to detect low-rate DDoS attacks. These metrics
  can be used to describe characteristics of network traffic and an appropriate metric
  facilitates building an effective model to detect low-rate DDoS attacks. We use
  MIT Lincoln Laboratory and CAIDA DDoS datasets to illustrate the efficiency and
  effectiveness of each metric for detecting mainly low-rate DDoS attacks.

ABS: The Internet is a typical complex network, whose traffic load is controlled by
  the inter-domain routing system. Due to the co-location of data plane and control
  plane of Border Gateway Protocol, the survivability of inter-domain routing system
  is sensitive to severe congestion. Therefore, an initial outage may lead to a cascade
  of failures in the Internet. But the cascading failures on links are able to be
  automatically restored when the congestion is mitigated. In this paper, we propose
  a model - CAFEIN for characterizing this special process. Based on CAFEIN, we assess
  the difference of impact under intentional attacks and random breakdowns; identify
  the worst affected part of the Internet; and study the propagation of cascading
  failures. Through simulations, we find that the cascading failures bring a great
  deal of added burden to the routing system. However, the cascading effect is amplified
  globally when the relative capacity of links is very low. Moreover, the difference
  of impact between intentional attack and random breakdown is not as prominent as
  previous research due to the unique automatic-restoration process.

ABS: 'The current Internet has exhibited a remarkable sustenance to evolution and
  growth; however, it is facing unprecedented challenges and may not be able to continue
  to sustain this evolution and growth in the future because it is based on design
  decisions made in the 1970s when the TCP/IP concepts were developed. The research
  thus has provided incremental solutions to the evolving Internet to address every
  new vulnerabilities. As a result, the Internet has increased in complexity, which
  makes it hard to manage, more vulnerable to emerging threats, and more fragile in
  the face of new requirements. With a goal towards overcoming this situation, a clean-slate
  future Internet architecture design paradigm has been suggested by the research
  communities. This research is focused on addressing and routing for a clean-slate
  future Internet architecture, called the Floating Cloud Tiered (FCT) internetworking
  model. The major goals of this study are: (i) to address the two related problems
  of routing scalability and addressing, through an approach which would leverage
  the existing structures in the current Internet architecture, (ii) to propose a
  solution that is acceptable to the ISP community that supports the Internet, and
  lastly (iii) to provide a transition platform and mechanism which is very essential

ABS: Network traffic monitoring supports fundamental network management tasks. However,
  monitoring tasks introduce non-trivial overhead to network devices such as switches.
  We propose a Distributed and Collaborative Monitoring system, named DCM, with the
  following properties. First, DCM allows switches to collaboratively achieve flow
  monitoring tasks and balance measurement load. Second, DCM is able to perform per-flow
  monitoring, by which different groups of flows are monitored using different actions.
  Third, DCM is a memory-efficient solution for switch data plane and guarantees system
  scalability. DCM uses novel two-stage Bloom filters to represent monitoring rules
  using small memory space. It utilizes the centralized SDN control to install, update,
  and reconstruct the two-stage Bloom filters in the switch data plane. We study how
  DCM performs two representative monitoring tasks, namely flow size counting and
  packet sampling, and evaluate its performance. Experiments using real data center
  and ISP traffic data on real network topologies show that DCM achieves highest measurement
  accuracy among existing solutions given the same memory budget of switches.

ABS: Unlike the current Internet where applications have little control over the path
  that their data travels, emerging network architectures enable applications to control
  the path their packets/flows take. Although an application can select its paths,
  providing an application with the up-to-date information needed to make an informed
  decision is a difficult problem. In particular, monitoring (i.e., collecting performance
  information about) a network the size of the Internet presents serious scalability
  challenges. In this paper, we present a network monitoring service that can provide
  applications with up-to-date network information, yet scale to the size of the Internet.
  Our network monitoring service dynamically selects and enables/disables monitoring
  points to focus on paths currently needed by applications. We present experimental
  results based on real-world traffic traces that show our system can provide up-to-date
  information for 80% of the paths used by applications by monitoring as few as 100
  strategically identified locations in the Internet.

ABS: Prevalent computing devices with networking capabilities have become critical
  network infrastructure for government, industry, academia and every-day life. As
  their value rises, the motivation driving network attacks on this infrastructure
  has shifted from the pursuit of notoriety to the pursuit of profit or political
  gains, leading to network attack on various scales. Facing diverse network attack
  strategies and overwhelming alters, much work has been devoted to correlate observed
  malicious events to pre-defined scenarios, attempting to deduce the attack plans
  based on expert models of how network attacks may transpire. We started the exploration
  of characterizing network attacks by investigating how temporal and spatial features
  of attack sequence can be used to describe different types of attack sources in
  real data set. Attack sequence models were built from real data set to describe
  different attack strategies. Based on the probabilistic attack sequence model, attack
  predictions were made to actively predict next possible actions. Experiments through
  attack predictions have revealed that sophisticated attackers can employ a number
  of obfuscation techniques to confuse the alert correlation engine or classifier.
  Unfortunately, most exiting work treats attack obfuscations by developing ad-hoc
  fixes to specific obfuscation technique. To this end, we developed an attack modeling
  framework that enables a systematical analysis of obfuscations. The proposed framework
  represents network attack strategies as general finite order Markov models and integrates
  it with different attack obfuscation models to form probabilistic graphical model
  models. A set of algorithms is developed to inference the network attack strategies
  given the models and the observed sequences, which are likely to be obfuscated.
  The algorithms enable an efficient analysis of the impact of different obfuscation
  techniques and attack strategies, by determining the expected classification accuracy
  of the obfuscated sequences. The algorithms are developed by integrating the recursion
  concept in dynamic programming and the Monte-Carlo method. The primary contributions
  of this work include the development of the formal framework and the algorithms
  to evaluate the impact of attack obfuscations. Several knowledge-driven attack obfuscation
  models are developed and analyzed to demonstrate the impact of different types of
  commonly used obfuscation techniques. The framework and algorithms developed in
  this work can also be applied to other contexts beyond network security. Any behavior
  sequences that might suffer from noise and require matching to pre-defined models
  can use this work to recover the most likely original sequence or evaluate quantitatively
  the expected classification accuracy one can achieve to separate the sequences.

ABS: Software-defined networking (SDN) has attracted many research interests among
  the networking community and has been deployed in many small to moderate networks.
  Although many approaches have been proposed to address the scalability issue of
  SDN, however, it is still an open problem whether SDN can be applied to large scale
  networks such as Tier-1 Internet service providers (ISP) when it works in passive
  mode. To address this problem, we in this paper analyze the number of flow entries
  that a switch needs to maintain and the number of flow setup requests per second
  that a controller needs to deal with, based on real data traces collected from a
  link between two routers in a Tier-1 ISP. The results show that, if we store a unique
  flow entry for every flow, SDN cannot be applied to large ISPs. In addition, if
  switches are required to deal with 12-tuple flow entries, SDN still cannot be applied
  to large Tier-1 ISPs even if we only setup unique flow entries for flows whose sizes
  are larger than 100 MB. However, if switches are required to deal with only 2-tuple
  flow entries, SDN can be applied to large Tier-1 ISPs if we only setup unique flow
  entries for flows whose sizes are larger than 10 MB.

ABS: After several IPv4 address exhaustion milestones in the last three years, it
  is becoming apparent that the world is running out of IPv4 addresses, and the adoption
  of the next generation Internet protocol, IPv6, though nascent, is accelerating.
  In order to better understand this unique and disruptive transition, we explore
  twelve metrics using ten global-scale datasets to create the longest and broadest
  measurement of IPv6 adoption to date. Using this perspective, we find that adoption,
  relative to IPv4, varies by two orders of magnitude depending on the measure examined
  and that care must be taken when evaluating adoption metrics in isolation. Further,
  we find that regional adoption is not uniform. Finally, and perhaps most surprisingly,
  we find that over the last three years, the nature of IPv6 utilization - in terms
  of traffic, content, reliance on transition technology, and performance - has shifted
  dramatically from prior findings, indicating a maturing of the protocol into production
  mode. We believe IPv6s recent growth and this changing utilization signal a true
  quantum leap.

ABS: A spectrum slot is the frequency range allocated to a single channel within a

  width granularity. The slot width of the spectrum slots to be used for an optical
  path in flexgrid optical networks can be adjusted in time to align with time-varying

  frequent adjustment of the slot width of optical paths places substantial signaling
  load on the control plane. In this paper, an online slot width adjustment mechanism
  is proposed for flexgrid optical networks under slot width update rate constraints
  in order to maintain the associated signaling load at acceptable levels. Real traffic

ABS: Software-defined networks can enable a variety of concurrent, dynamically instantiated,
  measurement tasks, that provide fine-grain visibility into network traffic. Recently,
  there have been many proposals to configure TCAM counters in hardware switches to
  monitor traffic. However, the TCAM memory at switches is fundamentally limited and
  the accuracy of the measurement tasks is a function of the resources devoted to
  them on each switch. This paper describes an adaptive measurement framework, called
  DREAM, that dynamically adjusts the resources devoted to each measurement task,
  while ensuring a user-specified level of accuracy. Since the trade-off between resource
  usage and accuracy can depend upon the type of tasks, their parameters, and traffic
  characteristics, DREAM does not assume an a priori characterization of this trade-off,
  but instead dynamically searches for a resource allocation that is sufficient to
  achieve a desired level of accuracy. A prototype implementation and simulations
  with three network-wide measurement tasks (heavy hitter, hierarchical heavy hitter
  and change detection) and diverse traffic show that DREAM can support more concurrent
  tasks with higher accuracy than several other alternatives.

  view of network state, and respond to changing network conditions. One of the main
  challenges in designing SDN enabled switches is efficient packet classification
  in the data plane. As the complexity of SDN applications increases, the data plane
  becomes more susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which can result in
  increased delays and packet loss. Accordingly, there is a strong need for network
  architectures that operate efficiently in the presence of malicious traffic. In
  particular, there is a need to protect authorized flows from DoS attacks. In this
  work we utilize a probabilistic data structure to pre-classify traffic with the
  aim of decoupling likely legitimate traffic from malicious traffic by leveraging
  the locality of packet flows. We validate our approach by examining a fundamental
  SDN application: software defined network firewall. For this application, our architecture
  dramatically reduces the impact of unknown/malicious flows on established/legitimate
  flows. We explore the effect of stochastic pre-classification in prioritizing data
  plane classification. We show how pre-classification can be used to increase the
  effective Quality of Service (QoS) for established flows and reduce the impact of
  adversarial traffic.'

ABS: Since adversaries may spoof their source IPs in their attacks, traceback schemes
  have been proposed to identify the attack source. Among these methods, Hybrid IP
  traceback schemes fuse packet marking and packet logging, using only one packet
  for traceback and reducing the storage requirements during packet logging. However,
  if a hybrid traceback scheme logs a packets digests on a router, the routers storage
  requirements will increase with the packet numbers. Its storage requirements cannot
  be bounded. Thus, we propose a 16-bit single packet hybrid IP traceback scheme.
  In our logging, the storage requirements can be bounded by the number of routes.
  And our marking can guarantee that fragmented packets can be re-assembled at the
  destination. Thus, compared with existing hybrid traceback schemes, our proposed
  scheme has higher accuracy in source tracking and has lower storage requirements
  for the routers.

  have the opportunity to design an internetwork layer routing protocal that provides
  efficient anonymity by decoupling identity from network location. Prior work in
  anonymity for the next-generation Internet fully trusts the users ISP. We propose
  Dovetail, which provides anonymity against an active attacker located at any single
  point within the network, including the users ISP. A major design challenge is to
  provide this protection without including an application layer proxy in data transmission.
  We address this in path construction by using a matchmaker node (an end host) to
  overlap two path segments at a dovetail node (a router). The dovetail then trims
  away part of the path so that data transmission bypasses the matchmaker. We develop
  a systematic mechanism to measure the topological anonymity of our designs, and
  we demonstrate their privacy and efficiency by Internet-scale simulations at the
  AS-level.

  evaluated to analyze the performance of the RBPBoost classification algorithm. From
  the simulation results, it is evident that RBPBoost algorithm achieves high detection
  accuracy (99.4%) with fewer false alarms and outperforms the existing ensemble algorithms.
  RBPBoost algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms with maximum gain of 6.6%

ABS: As an attempt to make network managers life easier, we present M3Omon, a system
  architecture that helps to develop monitoring applications and perform network diagnosis.
  M3Omon behaves as an intermediate layer between the traffic and monitoring applications
  that provides advanced features, high performance and low cost. Such advanced features
  leverage a multi-granular and multi-purpose approach to the monitoring problem.
  Multi-granular monitoring provides answers to tasks that use traffic aggregates
  to identify an event, and requires either flow records or packet data or even both
  to understand it and, eventually, take convenient countermeasures. M3Omon provides
  a simple API to access traffic simultaneously at several different granularities,
  i.e. packet-level, flow-level and aggregate statistics. The multi-purposed design
  of M3Omon allows not only performing tasks in parallel that are specifically targeted
  to different traffic-related purposes (e.g. traffic classification and intrusion
  detection) but also sharing granularities between applications, e.g. several concurrent
  applications fed from flow records that are provided by M3Omon. Finally, the low-cost
  characteristic is brought by off-the-shelf systems (the combination of open-source
  software and commodity hardware) and the high performance is achieved thanks to
  modifications in the standard NIC driver, low-level hardware interaction, efficient
  memory management and programming optimization.

ABS: An important task for network operators is to properly dimension the capacity
  of their links. Often, this is done by simple rules of thumb based on coarse traffic
  measurements provided, e.g., by SNMP. More accurate estimations of the required
  link capacity typically require packet-level measurements, which are hard to implement
  in todays high-speed networks. The challenge is, therefore, to accurately estimate
  the traffic statistics needed for estimating the required link capacity with minimal
  traffic measurement effort. This paper proposes a novel, hybrid procedure for link
  dimensioning that combines flow-level measurements, minimal efforts on packet captures,
  and an analytical traffic model. The result is an efficient and robust method to
  estimate required link capacities. Although the idea of estimating required capacities
  from flows is not new, the novelty of this paper is that it proposes a complete,
  efficient and deployable procedure. The proposed procedure has been extensively
  validated using real-world traffic captures dating from 2011 to 2012. Results show
  that, with minimal measurement effort, we are able to efficiently estimate the required
  bandwidth at timescales as low as 1 ms.

ABS: Multipath routing can provide a better solution for several of the current BGPs
  problems in the inter-domain scenario by allowing a cleaner separation between routing
  and traffic engineering and better failure containment. The separation between routing
  control logic and data forwarding, and the use of software defined networking principles
  open space to easier deployments of new routing protocols at the inter-domain level.
  This paper explores the potential of using a multipath policy based inter-domain
  routing algorithm based on an algebraic model. The algorithm establishes multiple
  paths to a destination following a policy-based architecture and works with simple
  destination-based hop-by-hop forwarding. We focus on the definition of algebraic
  models for the links, their composition and the resulting paths ranking. Our algorithm
  addresses the most common situations in the Internet and we include others not so
  common as backup links and sibling relations. We prove the correctness of the algorithm
  under conditions that open several implementation options and describe how it can
  use multipath for failure containment, using the extra paths to make each failure
  less important. The paper finishes with the presentation of some experimental results
  that illustrate the algorithm capabilities.

ABS: A variety of solutions have been proposed for detecting and preventing IP hijack
  attacks. Despite potentially serious consequences these solutions have not been
  widely deployed, partially because many ISPs do not view their risk as large enough
  to warrant investment. Nevertheless, a number of organizations such as critical
  national infrastructure are at a very high risk level and require a deployed solution.
  Is it possible for these sites to be protected despite the majority apathy, given
  that a critical mass of ISPs is generally required to participate in the solution?
  We examine this conflict by presenting an approach which determines AS vulnerability
  based on topological location. We next examine the effectiveness of incremental
  security deployment. We separately examine BGP hijack detection which, if improperly
  peered, may completely miss a hijack. Finally, we address a pessimistic view with
  respect to deployment and propose an approach in which an autonomous system can
  act in its own self-interest to determine a minimal threshold for hijack detection
  or prevention.

ABS: 'In response to high-profile Internet outages, BGP security variants have been
  proposed to prevent the propagation of bogus routing information. The objective
  of this paper is to inform discussions of which variant should be deployed in the
  Internet. To do this, we quantify the ability of the key protocols (origin authentication,
  soBGP, S-BGP, and data-plane verification) to limit the impact of traffic-attraction
  attacks; i.e., when an attacker deliberately draws traffic to its own network, in
  order to drop, tamper, or eavesdrop on packets. Our results and contributions are
  as follows: (1) One might expect that an attacker could maximize the volume of traffic
  it attracts by using the following intuitive strategy: the attacker should announce,
  to as many of its neighbors as possible, the shortest path that is not flagged as
  bogus by the secure protocol. Through simulations on an empirically-determined AS-level
  topology, we show that this strategy is surprisingly effective, even when an advanced
  security solution like S-BGP or data-plane verification is fully deployed. (2) Next,
  we show that these results underestimate the severity of attacks. In fact, counterintuitive
  strategies, like announcing longer paths, announcing to fewer neighbors, or triggering
  BGP loop-detection, can be used to attract even more traffic than the strategy above.
  We illustrate this using counterintuitive examples. We also demonstrate that these
  attacks are not merely hypothetical, by searching the empirical AS-level topology
  and identifying specific ASes that can launch these attacks. (3) We prove that it
  is NP hard to find a traffic-attraction attack strategy that attracts the maximum
  volume of traffic. Our results suggest that a clever export policy (i.e., where
  the attacker announces a legitimate path to a carefully chosen set of neighbors)
  an often attract almost as much traffic as a bogus path announcement. Thus, our
  work implies that mechanisms that police export policies (e.g., prefix filtering)
  are crucial, even if more advanced cryptographic solutions like S-BGP are fully
  deployed.'

ABS: 'Numerous cyberattack incidents have demonstrated adversaries capability to cause
  Internet outages lasting hours or even days, jeopardizing governmental, financial,
  telecommunication, transportation, and healthcare services. With the intensity and
  frequency of cyberattacks constantly growing, it becomes crucial to find a way to
  provide availability guarantees despite active adversaries. As an initial step toward
  building a highly available Internet, this dissertation explores how to secure the
  data plane against off-path adversaries that flood the network (Distributed Denial
  of Service attacks) as well as on-path adversaries that discriminate against traffic
  (selective dropping attacks). These two types of attacks are increasingly prevalent,
  and their mitigation will lead to substantial improvement in Internet availability.
  However, DDoS and selective dropping attacks have yet to be addressed efficiently
  and effectively in the current Internet, primarily due to the fact that many security
  problems are too pervasive and fundamental to be fixed using patches constrained
  by the underlying Internet architecture. To address this challenge, this dissertation
  studies complementary defense mechanisms on top of a recently proposed clean-slate
  Internet architecture. This new architecture is a key enabler of this dissertation,
  as it provides several useful architectural primitives to support fine-grained isolation
  and fair access to resources - two driving principles behind the design of the defense
  mechanisms in this work. Fine-grained isolation protects legitimate traffic from
  interference with other traffic, including attack traffic. When isolation is not
  possible, fair access guarantees that legitimate traffic receives a fair share of
  resources during resource competition. Guided by these two principles, the first
  part of the dissertation describes novel solutions that cover three aspects of DDoS
  defense: (1) isolating DDoS traffic via bandwidth reservation, (2) bounding the
  waiting time before a successful reservation of flow bandwidth, and (3) ensuring
  that every flow complies with its allocated bandwidth limit without keeping per-flow
  state. The second part of the dissertation explores the prevention of address-based
  selective dropping through topological anonymity, and describes a lightweight anonymous
  forwarding scheme with near-optimal latency under a relaxed attacker model. The
  integration of these mechanisms achieves end-to-end availability guarantees on top
  of the clean-slate architecture under the assumptions that the lower layers are
  available and the routing paths are given. The resulting guarantees are independent
  of the strength of remote attackers, a feature that none of the existing work is
  able to achieve. Since several of the proposed mechanisms can be deployed incrementally
  for incremental protection, they can also improve the availability of the current
  Internet.'

  sets of elements observed by network adversaries. We present a modular system that
  allows users to efficiently and conveniently create such distributions and use them
  to improve their security. The major components of this system are (i) an ontology
  of network-element types that represents the main threats to and vulnerabilities
  of anonymous communication over Tor, (ii) a formal language that allows users to
  naturally express trust beliefs about network elements, and (iii) a conversion procedure
  that takes the ontology, public information about the network, and user beliefs
  written in the trust language and produce a Bayesian Belief Network that represents
  the probability distribution in a way that is concise and easily sampleable. We
  also present preliminary experimental results that show the distribution produced
  by our system can improve security when employed by users; further improvement is
  seen when the system is employed by both users and services.

ABS: 'A distributed hash table (DHT) is an important kind of P2P system that provides
  decentralized services to look up resources in various applications. In this context,
  Chord and Kademlia are two relevant DHTs and several pieces of work have appeared
  in the literature where their performance is evaluated. Unfortunately, available
  results are neither consistent nor concluding. This situation arises from the use
  of different churn models (i.e., peer arrivals and departures); all of them neglecting
  the fact that churn happens since the beginning of the lifetime of DHTs. Furthermore,
  available performance evaluations do not consider that DHT parameter settings are
  nonequivalent. To address these concerns, in this paper we present an exhaustive,
  fair and realistic evaluation framework integrated by: 1) A state-of-the-art churn
  model executed by peers since their creation. 2) An evaluation methodology that
  considers the difference in meaning of the parameters belonging to different DHTs.
  3) A churn metric that quantifies the rate of change of the P2P population. By means
  of this evaluation framework, we found that under similar conditions, Kademlia exhibits
  higher performance than Chord. We conclude that DHTs must have mechanisms to deal
  with high churn during their whole existence, otherwise, they may not achieve a
  state where peers are correctly connected. Furthermore, our findings suggest that
  DHTs should rely on less-dynamic peers to improve their performance.'

ABS: Facing diverse network attack strategies and overwhelming alters, much work has

  a systematic analysis of the impact of attack obfuscation, this paper models attack
  strategies as general finite order Markov models, and treats obfuscated observations
  as noises. Taking into account that only finite observation window and limited computational
  time can be afforded, this work develops an algorithm to efficiently inference on
  the joint distribution of clean and obfuscated attack sequences. The inference algorithm
  recovers the optimal match of obfuscated sequences to attack models, and enables
  a systematic and quantitative analysis on the impact of obfuscation on attack classification.

ABS: This project aims to design an entropy based model to detect anomalies in Internet
  traffic addressed to IP darkspace, formed by a group of IP addresses that are not
  assigned to any host but also receive unsolicited traffic which may be suspicious.
  We want to obtain an anomaly detection system that does not require deep packet
  inspection and therefore is fast, lightweight and without great computing cost.
  To do this we calculate for the received packets an entropy vector including the
  parameters source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, protocol,
  TCP flags, TTL, and IP length. We have compared our results with other methods to
  try to predict attacks and anomalies previously detected and we obtained around
  80% accuracy. As a first approximation the results are positive. However, we leave
  as future work to make some adjustments to our model to get better predictions.

ABS: With the growth in number and significance of the emerging applications that
  require extremely low latencies, network operators are facing increasing need to
  perform latency measurement on per-flow basis for network monitoring and troubleshooting.
  In this paper, we propose COLATE, the first per-flow latency measurement scheme
  that requires no probe packets and time stamping. Given a set of observation points,
  COLATE records packet timing information at each point so that later for any two
  points, it can accurately estimate the average and standard deviation of the latencies
  experienced by the packets of any flow in passing the two points. The key idea is
  that when recording packet timing information, COLATE purposely allows noise to
  be introduced for minimizing storage space, and when querying the latency of a target
  flow, COLATE uses statistical techniques to denoise and obtain an accurate latency
  estimate. COLATE is designed to be efficiently implementable on network middleboxes.
  In terms of processing overhead, COLATE performs only one hash and one memory update
  per packet. In terms of storage space, COLATE uses less than 0.1 bit per packet,
  which means that, on a backbone link with about half a million packets per second,
  using a 256GB drive, COLATE can accumulate time stamps of packets traversing the
  link for over 1.5 years. We evaluated COLATE using three real traffic traces that
  include a backbone traffic trace, an enterprise network traffic trace, and a data
  center traffic trace. Results show that COLATE always achieves the required reliability
  for any given confidence interval.

ABS: Network virtualisation is a promising technique for a better future Internet
  by allowing for network resource sharing. However, resource sharing requires that
  virtual nodes and links be embedded onto substrate nodes and links (virtual network
  embedding), and thereafter the allocated resources dynamically managed throughout
  the lifetime of the virtual network (dynamic resource allocation). Since the constrained
  virtual network embedding problem is NP-Hard, many existing approaches are not only
  static, but also propose heuristics by making simplifying assumptions, most of which
  would not apply in practical environments. This PhD research proposes improvements
  to both virtual network embedding and dynamic resource allocation. The objective
  is to achieve an efficient utilisation of physical network resources. To this end,
  we propose a path generation-based approach for a one-shot, unsplittable flow virtual
  network embedding, and a reinforcement learning-based dynamic allocation of substrate
  network resources

ABS: Network virtualisation has received attention as a way to allow for sharing of
  physical network resources. Sharing resources involves mapping of virtual nodes
  and links onto physical nodes and links respectively, and thereafter managing the
  allocated resources to ensure efficient resource utilisation. In this paper, we
  apply artificial neural networks for a dynamic, decentralised and autonomous allocation
  of physical network resources to the virtual networks. The objective is to achieve
  better efficiency in the utilisation of substrate network resources while ensuring
  that the quality of service requirements of the virtual networks are not violated.
  The proposed approach is evaluated by comparison with two static resource allocation
  schemes and a reinforcement learning-based approach.

ABS: 'Internet transit is an economy where providers sell traffic-delivery services.
  Traffic attraction refers to BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) techniques enabling an
  AS (Autonomous System) to receive traffic that would otherwise flow elsewhere. Unlike
  prior studies that present security perspectives on traffic attraction or deal with
  economic considerations in game-theoretic settings, this paper focuses on the economics
  of customer-traffic attraction by transit providers and report extensive simulations
  in an Internet-scale model configured with realistic data on traffic, topology,
  and pricing. We consider traffic attraction by tier-1, tier-2, and tier-3 networks
  with 3 types of reactions by other networks: filtering, customer-disconnections,
  and attempts of losing ASes to attract traffic to themselves. Our results demonstrate
  that transit providers can derive substantial financial benefits from attracting
  customer traffic, with tier-1 networks being in the strongest position to do so.
  The traffic attraction remains effective despite the countermeasures unless participation
  in them is broad.'

ABS: Gaussian traffic models are widely used in the domain of network traffic modeling.
  The central assumption is that traffic aggregates are Gaussian distributed. Due
  to its importance, the Gaussian character of network traffic has been extensively
  assessed by researchers in the past years. In 2001, researchers showed that the
  property of Gaussianity can be disturbed by traffic bursts. However, assumptions
  on network infrastructure and traffic composition made by the authors back in 2001
  are not consistent with those of todays networks. The goal of this paper is to study
  the impact of traffic bursts on the degree of Gaussianity of network traffic. We
  identify traffic bursts, uncover applications and hosts that generate them and,
  ultimately, relate these findings to the Gaussianity degree of the traffic expressed
  by a goodness-of-fit factor. In our analysis we use recent traffic captures from
  2011 and 2012. Our results show that Gaussianity can be directly linked to the presence
  or absence of extreme traffic bursts. In addition, we also show that even in a more
  homogeneous network, where hosts have similar access speeds to the Internet, we
  can identify extreme traffic bursts that might compromise Gaussianity fit.

ABS: The problem of embedding a graph metric into a nice and simpler host metric space
  with low distortion has been a subject of extensive research, motivated from several
  applications in various domains. Nice metric spaces are those with well-studied
  structural properties, allowing to design efficient approximation algorithms. Particular
  host metrics of choice, also favored from the algorithmic point of view, are trees,
  spanning trees and collection of them. We investigate the embedability of a graph
  metric into a tree metric, a spanning tree metric and a collection of them and detect
  such metric tree-like structure in graphs. First, we investigate few graph parameters
  which capture and quantify the phenomenon of being metrically close to a tree. By
  bringing all those parameters together, we not only provide efficient means for
  detecting such metric tree-like structures in large-scale networks but also show
  how such structures can be used for fundamental primitives in many data and graph
  mining algorithms. Also, we present strong evidences that a number of real-life
  networks, taken from different domains exhibit tree-like structures from a metric
  point of view. Second, we study collective tree spanners for graphs enjoying special
  Robertson Seymours tree-decompositions, and demonstrate interesting consequences
  of obtained results. Specifically, we demonstrate a polynomial time algorithm that,
  given an n-vertex graph G admitting a multiplicative tree t-spanner (NP-hard problem),
  constructs a system of log2 n collective additive tree O(t log n)-spanners of G.
  That is, with a slight increase in the number of trees and in the stretch, one can
  turn a multiplicative tree spanner into a small set of collective additive tree
  spanners. We extend this result to demonstrate that, for every fixed k, there is
  a polynomial time algorithm that, given an n-vertex graph G admitting a multiplicative
  t-spanner with tree-width k-1, constructs a system of at most k(1+log2 n) collective
  additive tree O(t log n)-spanners of G. Finally, we provide an efficient algorithm
  to embed weighted graphs into tree metrics with proven theoretical bounds and good
  embedding results on real-world datasets.

ABS: 'Can we model complex networks as hyper graphs and compress them for faster storage,
  transmission, and mining of data? In this paper, we propose a modeling and compression
  technique that consists of two phases: (i) mapping networks to hyper graphs by exploiting
  inherent or structural semantic features, and (ii) partitioning the resulting hyper
  graph such that similar nodes are grouped into a number of possibly disconnected
  parts. The partitioned hyper graph is then processed in order to yield more structural
  redundancy to increase compression. We provide empirical results that compare the
  proposed method to random and natural orderings of select real networks using an
  information-theoretic measure. When modeling networks using hyper graphs as proposed
  here, the potential for compactness and compression increases, as observed in our
  experimental evaluation. This benefits a variety of domains in a variety of ways,
  such as social networks, biological systems, and the need to represent these as
  compactly as possible for faster execution of queries. We also address questions

ABS: Routing policies used in the Internet can be restrictive, limiting communication
  between source-destination pairs to one path, when often better alternatives exist.
  To avoid route flapping, recovery mechanisms may be dampened, making adaptation
  slow. Unstructured overlays have been proposed to mitigate the issues of path and
  performance failures in the Internet by routing through an indirect-path via overlay
  peer(s). Choosing alternate-paths in overlay networks is a challenging issue. Ensuring
  both availability and performance guarantees on alternate paths requires aggressive
  monitoring of all overlay paths using active probing; this limits scalability. An
  alternate technique to select an overlay-path is to bias its selection based on
  physical disjointness criteria to bypass the failure on the primary-path. Recently,
  several techniques have emerged which can optimize the selection of a disjoint-path
  without incurring the high costs associated with probing paths. In this paper, we
  show that using only commodity approaches, i.e. running infrequent traceroutes between
  overlay hosts, a lot of information can be revealed about the underlying physical
  path diversity in the overlay network which can be used to make informed-guesses
  for alternate-path selection. We test our approach using datasets between real-world
  hosts in AMP and RIPE networks.

ABS: As inter-domain routing on todays Internet does not and basically cannot consider
  traffic load when determining best traffic forwarding paths, it is not always optimal
  for a router to forward packets along its default path, especially when the routers
  default output port incurs a long queuing delay. In this paper, we design a new
  approach called TED in which border routers of autonomous systems (AS) adaptively
  deflect outbound traffic from a congested default path to an alternative path to
  significantly improve inter-domain traffic engineering (TE) and end-to-end throughput.
  With TED, every router only needs to examine the queue length of its own outgoing
  ports to orchestrate its deflection operation and ensure traffic forwarding is at
  line speed. It does not need to communicate or coordinate with other TED-capable
  routers or modify packet content, making TED incrementally deployable. Our evaluation
  shows that TED significantly increases the average throughput of traffic flows,
  and the improvement is comparable to directly upgrading router hardware and capacity.
  Finally, a prototype of TED on NetFPGA is also implemented.

ABS: To access to the Internet, regional Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have to
  buy transit service from global ISPs. Provider selection strategies are related
  closely to ISPs economic interests. With the growing number of potential transit
  provider and the flattening topology of the Internet, its getting harder for ISPs
  to select upstream provider empirically as before. In this paper, we propose a concept
  of bargaining power as an important decision-making criterion of ISPs during their
  provider selection process, and design a value based framework to help ISPs provider
  selection based on it. The bargaining power of each involved ISP is computed by
  applying the Shapley Value based transit value distribution mechanism to each involved
  traffic flow, taking into consideration the cooperative possibility among ISPs and
  the market roles these ISPs play, i.e., potential providers or potential competitors.
  It reflects not only the cost and link level transit performance, geographical constraints,
  but also includes the influence of interconnection impacts, demand/supply relationships
  by analyzing the traffic content and commercial relationships among ISPs. We then
  design a quantitative provider selection framework and instantiate our framework
  using the operation data of a real-world network, CERNET, a national ISP in . In
  addition, we evaluate our provider selection results for CERNET and the experimental
  results show the effectiveness and practicability of our solution in this paper.

ABS: Botnets are a well recognized global cyber-security threat as they enable attack
  communities to command large collections of compromised computers (bots) on-demand.
  Peer to-peer (P2P) distributed hash tables (DHT) have become particularly attractive
  botnet command and control (C&amp;C) solutions due to the high level resiliency
  gained via the diffused random graph overlays they produce. The injection of Sybils,
  computers pretending to be valid bots, remains a key defensive strategy against
  DHT-structured P2P botnets. This research uses packet level network simulations
  to explore the relative merits of random, informed, and partially informed Sybil
  placement strategies. It is shown that random placements perform nearly as effectively
  as the tested more informed strategies, which require higher levels of inter-defender
  co-ordination. Moreover, it is shown that aspects of the DHT-structured P2P botnets
  behave as statistically nonergodic processes, when viewed from the perspective of
  stochastic processes. This suggests that although optimal Sybil placement strategies
  appear to exist they would need carefully tuning to each specific P2P botnet instance.

ABS: Networks arise from modeling complex systems in various fields, such as computer
  science, social science, biology, psychology and finance. Understanding and analyzing
  networks help us better understand these complex systems and extract useful information.
  In this dissertation, we study problems on network sampling, network modeling and
  data mining on networks. Random graphs with given vertex degrees have been widely
  used as a model for many real-world complex networks. However, both statistical
  inference and analytic study of such networks present great challenges. In Chapter
  2, we propose new sequential importance sampling methods for sampling networks with
  a given degree sequence. These samples can be used to approximate closely the null
  distributions of a number of test statistics involved in such networks, and provide
  an accurate estimate of the total number of networks with given vertex degrees.
  We study the asymptotic behavior of the proposed algorithm and prove that the importance
  weight remains bounded as the size of the graph grows. This property guarantees
  that the proposed sampling algorithm can still work efficiently even for large sparse
  graphs. We apply our method to a range of examples to demonstrate its efficiency
  in real problems. One important question for complex networks is how the networks
  connectivity will be affected if the network is under targeted attacks, i.e., the
  nodes with the most links are attacked. In Chapter 3, we found that a dolphin network
  is resilient to targeted attacks. To further study the resilient property, we fit
  an exponential random graph model to the dolphin network. The fitted model characterizes
  network resiliency and identifies local structures that can reproduce the global
  resilience property. Such a statistical model can be used to build the Internet
  and other networks to increase the attack tolerance of those networks. The problem
  of finding densely connected subgraphs in a network has attracted a lot of recent
  attention. Such subgraphs are sometimes referred to as communities in social networks
  or molecular modules in protein networks. In Chapter 4, we propose two Monte Carlo
  optimization algorithms for identifying the densest subgraphs with a fixed size
  or with size in a given range. The new algorithms combine the idea of simulated
  annealing and efficient moves for the Markov chain, and both algorithms are shown
  to converge to the set of optimal states (densest subgraphs) with probability one.
  When applied to a yeast protein interaction network and a stock market graph, the
  algorithms identify interesting new densely connected subgraphs. One of the most
  relevant features of networks representing real systems is the community structure.
  Detecting communities is of great importance in understanding, analyzing, organizing
  networks. In Chapter 5, we describe a statistical framework for modularity-based
  network community detection. We derive the modularity function under the proposed
  statistical framework, and propose a fast modularity maximization algorithm based
  on the eigen-spectrum of the modularity matrix. A hypothesis testing procedure is
  developed to determine the significance of an identified community structure. The
  modularity formulated under the proposed statistical framework is shown to be consistent
  under the degree-corrected stochastic block model framework. Several synthetic networks
  and real world networks are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

ABS: Data-driven cyber security analytics is one important approach to understanding
  cyber attacks. Despite its importance, there are essentially no systematic studies
  on characterizing the statistical properties of cyber attacks. The present dissertation
  introduces a systematic statistical framework for analyzing cyber attack data. It
  also presents three specific results that are obtained by applying the framework
  to analyze some honeypot- and blackhole-captured cyber attack data, while noting
  that the framework is equally applicable to other data that may contain richer attack
  information. The first result is that honeypot-captured cyber attacks often exhibit
  Long-Range Dependence (LRD). The second result is that honeypot-captured cyber attacks
  can exhibit Extreme Values (EV). The third result describes spatial and temporal
  characterizations that are exhibited by blackhole-captured cyber attacks. The dissertation
  shows that by exploiting the statistical properties exhibited by cyber attack data,
  it is possible to achieve certain gray-box predictions with high accuracy. Such
  prediction capability can be exploited to guide the proactive allocation of resources
  for effective defense.

ABS: Network virtualisation is considerably gaining attention as a solution to ossification
  of the Internet. However, the success of network virtualisation will depend in part
  on how efficiently the virtual networks utilise substrate network resources. In
  this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach to virtual network resource
  management. We propose to model the substrate network as a decentralised system
  and introduce a learning algorithm in each substrate node and substrate link, providing
  self-organization capabilities. We propose a multiagent learning algorithm that
  carries out the substrate network resource management in a coordinated and decentralised
  way. The task of these agents is to use evaluative feedback to learn an optimal
  policy so as to dynamically allocate network resources to virtual nodes and links.
  The agents ensure that while the virtual networks have the resources they need at
  any given time, only the required resources are reserved for this purpose. Simulations
  show that our dynamic approach significantly improves the virtual network acceptance
  ratio and the maximum number of accepted virtual network requests at any time while
  ensuring that virtual network quality of service requirements such as packet drop
  rate and virtual link delay are not affected.

ABS: Energy efficiency has become an important design goal for networking equipment.
  Traditionally routers and switches have been designed to minimize peak power consumption
  but they operate most of the time with settings and traffic that is far from that
  peak. Therefore, many elements and functions of networking equipment are being redesigned
  to improve energy efficiency. A common functionality in networking is flow identification
  that is needed in many applications. Flow identification can be implemented with
  Content Addressable Memories (CAMs) or alternatively with several data structures.
  Among those, one efficient option is Cuckoo hashing that enables fast searches and
  high memory utilization at the cost of complicating the insertion procedure. In
  this letter, first the energy efficiency of exact matching using Cuckoo hashing
  is analyzed and then a technique is presented to improve the energy efficiency of
  Cuckoo hashing. The proposed scheme is evaluated using a traffic monitoring application
  and compared with the traditional Cuckoo hashing. The results show that significant
  energy savings can be obtained by using the proposed technique.

ABS: 'Reneging occurs when a transport layer data receiver first selectively acks
  data, and later discards that data from its receiver buffer prior to delivery to
  the receiving application or socket buffer. Reliable transport protocols such as
  TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)
  are designed to tolerate reneging. We argue that this design should be changed because:
  (1) reneging is a rare event in practice, and the memory saved when reneging does
  occur is insignificant, and (2) by not tolerating reneging, transport protocols
  have the potential for improved performance as has been shown in the case of SCTP.
  To support our argument, we analyzed TCP traces from three different domains (Internet
  backbone, wireless, enterprise). We detected reneging in only 0.05% of the analyzed
  TCP flows. In each reneging case, the operating system was fingerprinted thus allowing
  the reneging behavior of Linux, FreeBSD and Windows to be more precisely characterized.
  The average main memory returned each time to the reneging operating system was
  on the order of two TCP segments. Reneging saves so little memory that it is not
  worth the trouble. Since reneging happens rarely and when it does happen, reneging
  returns insignificant memory, we recommend designing reliable transport protocols
  to not permit reneging.'

ABS: 'Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are one of the challenging network
  security problems to address. The existing defense mechanisms against DDoS attacks
  usually filter the attack traffic at the victim side. The problem is exacerbated
  when there are spoofed IP addresses in the attack packets. In this case, even if
  the attacking traffic can be filtered by the victim, the attacker may reach the
  goal of blocking the access to the victim by consuming the computing resources or
  by consuming a big portion of the bandwidth to the victim. This paper proposes a
  Trace back-based Defense against DDoS Flooding Attacks (TDFA) approach to counter
  this problem. TDFA consists of three main components: Detection, Trace back, and
  Traffic Control. In this approach, the goal is to place the packet filtering as
  close to the attack source as possible. In doing so, the traffic control component
  at the victim side aims to set up a limit on the packet forwarding rate to the victim.
  This mechanism effectively reduces the rate of forwarding the attack packets and
  therefore improves the throughput of the legitimate traffic. Our results based on
  real world data sets show that TDFA is effective to reduce the attack traffic and
  to defend the quality of service for the legitimate traffic.'

ABS: Research in systems engineering and design is increasingly focused on complex
  sociotechnical systems whose structures are not directly controlled by the designers,
  but evolve endogenously as a result of decisions and behaviors of self-directed
  entities. Examples of such systems include smart electric grids, Internet, smart
  transportation networks, and open source product development communities. To influence
  the structure and performance of such systems, it is crucial to understand the local
  decisions that result in observed system structures. This paper presents three approaches
  to estimate the local behaviors and preferences in complex evolutionary systems,
  modeled as networks, from its structure at different time steps. The first approach
  is based on the generalized preferential attachment model of network evolution.
  In the second approach, statistical regression-based models are used to estimate
  the local decision-making behaviors from consecutive snapshots of the system structure.
  In the third approach, the entities are modeled as rational decision-making agents
  who make linking decisions based on the maximization of their payoffs. Within the
  decision-centric framework, the multinomial logit choice model is adopted to estimate
  the preferences of decision-making nodes. The approaches are illustrated and compared
  using an example of the autonomous system (AS) level Internet. The approaches are
  generally applicable to a variety of complex systems that can be modeled as networks.
  The insights gained are expected to direct researchers in choosing the most applicable
  estimation approach to get the node-level behaviors in the context of different
  scenarios.

ABS: An accurate Internet topology graph is important in many areas of networking,
  from understanding ISP business relationships to diagnosing network anomalies. Most
  Internet mapping efforts have derived the network structure, at the level of interconnected
  autonomous systems (ASes), from a rather limited set of vantage points. In this
  paper, we argue that a promising approach to revealing the hidden areas of the Internet
  topology is through active measurement from an observation platform that scales
  with the growing Internet. By leveraging measurements performed by an extension
  to a popular P2P system, we show that this approach indeed exposes significant new
  topological information. Our study is based on traceroute measurements from more
  than 992,000 IPs in over 3,700 ASes distributed across the Internet hierarchy, many
  in regions of the Internet not covered by publicly available path information. To
  address this issue we develop heuristics that identify 23,914 new AS links not visible
  in the publicly-available BGP data-12.86 percent more customer-provider links and
  40.99 percent more peering links, than previously reported. We validate our heuristics
  using data from a tier-1 ISP, and show that they successfully filter out all false
  links introduced by public IP-to-AS mapping. We analyze properties of the Internet
  graph that includes these new links and characterize why they are missing. Finally,
  we have made the identified set of links and their inferred relationships publicly
  available.

ABS: Scalable routing schemes for large-scale networks, especially future Internet,
  are required. Geometric routing scheme is a promising candidate to solve the scalability
  issue of routing tables in conventional IP routing based on longest prefix matching.
  In this scheme, network nodes are assigned virtual coordinates and packets are forwarded
  towards their intended destination following a distance-decreasing policy. Dynamics
  in the network such as node/link failures might affect this forwarding and lead
  packets to a dead end. We proposed recovery techniques in geometric routing to deliver
  packets to the destination in case of failures. In this paper, we perform an analysis
  on the availability of the proposed protection techniques on the Internet graph.
  The routing scheme over optical transport network is considered and the reliability
  data of physical components and a known network availability model are used. This
  evaluation is compared with the shortest cycle scheme which finds two node disjoint
  paths between every source and destination in the topology and also with geometric
  routing with no protection. The results show that the proposed scheme performs reasonably
  well compared to the shortest cycle scheme and significantly enhances the availability
  compared to geometric routing without any protection.

ABS: The deployment and operation of global network architectures can exhibit complex,
  dynamic behavior and the comprehensive validation of their properties, without actually
  building and running the systems, can only be achieved with the help of simulations.
  Packet-level models are not feasible in the Internet scale, but we are still interested
  in the phenomena that emerge when the systems are run in their intended environment.
  We argue for the high-level simulation methodology and introduce a simulation environment
  based on aggregate models built on state-of-the-art datasets available while respecting
  invariants observed in measurements. The models developed are aimed at studying
  a clean slate name-based interdomain routing architecture and provide an abundance
  of parameters for sensitivity analysis and a modular design with a balanced level
  of detail in different aspects of the model. In addition to introducing several
  reusable models for traffic, topology, and deployment, we report our experiences
  in using the high-level simulation approach and potential pitfalls related to it.

  a general model that encompasses all these methods.  With this model, we compute
  the Cramer-Rao lower bounds and the variances of HCDD estimations. The theoretic

ABS: Online network traffic measurements and analysis is critical for detecting and
  preventing any real-time anomalies in the network. We propose, implement, and evaluate
  an online, adaptive measurement platform, which utilizes real-time traffic analysis
  results to refine subsequent traffic measurements. Central to our solution is the
  concept of Multi-Resolution Tiling (MRT), a heuristic approach that performs sequential
  analysis of traffic data to zoom into traffic subregions of interest. However, MRT
  is sensitive to transient traffic spikes. In this paper, we propose three novel
  traffic streaming algorithms that overcome the limitations of MRT and can cater
  to varying degrees of computational and storage budgets, detection latency, and
  accuracy of query response. We evaluate our streaming algorithms on a highly parallel
  and programmable hardware as well as a traditional software-based platforms. The
  algorithms demonstrate significant accuracy improvement over MRT in detecting anomalies
  consisting of synthetic hard-to-track elephant flows and global icebergs. Our proposed
  algorithms maintain the worst-case complexities of the MRT while incurring only
  a moderate increase in average resource utilization.

  access to the physical layer of a network stack allows for timing channels that
  are virtually invisible: Sub-microsecond modulations that are undetectable by software
  endhosts. Therefore, covert timing channels implemented in the physical layer can
  be a serious threat to the security of a system or a network. In fact, we empirically
  demonstrate an effective covert timing channel over nine routing hops and thousands
  of miles over the Internet (the National Lambda Rail). Our covert timing channel
  works with cross traffic, less than 10% bit error rate, which can be masked by forward
  error correction, and a covert rate of 81 kilobits per second. Key to our approach
  is access and control over every bit in the physical layer of a 10 Gigabit network
  stack (a bit is 100 picoseconds wide at 10 gigabit per seconds), which allows us
  to modulate and interpret interpacket spacings at sub-microsecond scale. We discuss

ABS: Content delivery networks (CDNs) deploy globally distributed systems of caches
  in a large number of autonomous systems (ASes). It is important for a CDN operator
  to satisfy the performance requirements of end users, while minimizing the cache
  deployment cost. In this paper, we study the cache deployment optimization (CaDeOp)
  problem of determining how much server, energy, and bandwidth resources to provision
  in each cache AS, i.e., each AS chosen for cache deployment. The CaDeOp objective
  is to minimize the total cost incurred by the CDN, subject to meeting the end-user
  performance requirements. We formulate the CaDeOp problem as a mixed integer program
  (MIP) and solve it for realistic AS-level topologies, traffic demands, and non-linear
  energy and bandwidth costs. We also evaluate the sensitivity of the results to our
  parametric assumptions. When the end-user performance requirements become more stringent,
  the CDN footprint rapidly expands, requiring cache deployments in additional ASes
  and geographical regions. Also, the CDN cost increases several times, with the cost
  balance shifting toward bandwidth and energy costs. On the other hand, the traffic
  distribution among the cache ASes stays relatively even, with the top 20% of the
  cache ASes serving around 30% of the overall traffic.

  on IPv6 infrastructure and analyzed location accuracy against ground truth. Results
  show that overall IPv6 CBG had up to 30% larger average error distance estimates
  as compared to IPv4 CBG. However, CBG performance varied depending on the location
  of the target host. Hosts located in the Asia-Pacific region performed the worst,
  while hosts located in Europe had the best performance in median error distance.
  AS-level path differences between IPv4 and IPv6 and the number of landmarks had

ABS: Packet filtering performance of basic firewalls largely affects the throughput
  of a network protected by the firewall. The packet filtering firewalls filter packets
  based on a set of filtering rules. The traditional approach for packet filtering
  works by checking a packet against the filtering rules by scanning from the first
  rule in the set and continuing to scan rules until a match is found. If no match
  is found, then a default rule is applied. This approach is inefficient if the number
  of rules is too large and majority of the packets match with rules located towards
  the end of the rule set. In this paper, we propose a data mining based technique
  for packet filtering. We consider each rule in the rule set a class. A classifier
  is first trained with labeled training data. Each such labeled data point contains
  a packet header info and the corresponding class label (i.e., rule number with which
  the packet matches). Then the classifier is used to classify new incoming packets.
  The predicted class (i.e., rule number) is checked against the packet to see if
  this packet really matches the predicted rule. If yes, the corresponding action
  (i.e., accept or deny) of the rule is taken. Otherwise (if prediction of the classifier
  is wrong), we go back to the traditional way of matching rules. The advantage of
  this data mining firewall is that it offers a much faster rule matching. We have
  proven both analytically and empirically that even with millions of real network
  traffic packets and hundreds of rules, the classifier can achieve very high accuracy,
  thereby making firewall six times or more faster in making filtering decision.

ABS: Among outstanding challenges to Internet-wide topology mapping using active probes
  is balancing efficiency, e.g. induced load and time, with coverage. Toward maximizing
  probe utility, we introduce Ingress Point Spreading (IPS). IPS utilizes ingress
  diversity discovered in prior rounds of probing to rank-order available vantage
  points such that future probes traverse all known paths into a target network. We
  implement and deploy IPS to probe ~49k random prefixes drawn from the global BGP
  table using a distributed collection of vantage points. As compared to existing
  mapping systems, we discover 12% more unique vertices and 12% more edges using ~50%
  fewer probes, in half the time.

ABS: How pervasive is the vulnerability to linkflooding attacks that degrade connectivity
  of thousands of Internet hosts? Are some network topologies and geographic regions
  more vulnerable than others? Do practical countermeasures exist? To answer these
  questions, we introduce the notion of the routing bottlenecks and show that it is
  a fundamental property of Internet design; i.e., it is a consequence of route-cost
  minimizations. We illustrate the pervasiveness of routing bottlenecks in an experiment
  comprising 15 countries and 15 cities distributed around the world, and measure
  their susceptibility to linkflooding attacks. We present the key characteristics
  of routing bottlenecks, including size, link type, and distance from host destinations,
  and suggest specific structural and operational countermeasures to linkflooding
  attacks. These countermeasures can be deployed by network operators without major
  Internet redesign.

ABS: IP address lookup is very crucial in performance of routers. Several works have
  been done on prefix caching to enhance the performance of IP address lookup. Since
  a prefix represents a range of IP addresses, a prefix cache shows better performance
  than an IP address cache.However, not every prefix is cacheable in itself. In a
  prefix cache it causes false hit to cache a non-leaf prefix because there is possibly
  the longer matching prefix in the routing table. Prefix expansion techniques such
  as complete prefix tree expansion (CPTE) make it possible to cache the non-leaf
  prefixes as the expanded forms, but it is hard to manage the expanded prefixes.
  The expanded prefixes sometimes incur a great deal of update overhead in a routing
  table. We propose a bitmap-based prefix cache (BMCache) to provide low update overhead
  as well as low cache miss ratio. The proposed scheme does not have any expanded
  prefixes in the routing table, but it can expand a non-leaf prefix using a bitmap
  on caching time. The trace-driven simulation shows that BMCache has very low miss
  ratio in spite of its low update overhead compared to other schemes.

ABS: Social, technical and business connections can all give rise to security risks.
  These risks can be substantial when individual compromises occur in combinations,
  and difficult to predict when some connections are not easily observed. A significant
  and relevant challenge is to predict these risks using only locally-derivable information.
  We illustrate by example that this challenge can be met if some general topological
  features of the connection network are known. By simulating an attack propagation
  on two large real-world networks, we identify structural regularities in the resulting
  loss distributions, from which we can relate various measures of a networks risks
  to its topology. While deriving these formulae requires knowing or approximating
  the connective structure of the network, applying them requires only locally-derivable
  information. On the theoretical side, we show that our risk-estimating methodology
  gives good approximations on randomly-generated scale-free networks with parameters
  approximating those in our study. Since many real-world networks are formed through
  preferential attachment mechanisms that yield similar scale-free topologies, we
  expect this methodology to have a wider range of applications to risk management
  whenever a large number of connections is involved.

GEOLOC: Brisbane, AU
ABS: An intrinsic challenge associated with evaluating proposed techniques for detecting
  Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and distinguishing them from Flash
  Events (FEs) is the extreme scarcity of publicly available real-word traffic traces.
  Those available are either heavily anonymised or too old to accurately reflect the
  current trends in DDoS attacks and FEs. This paper proposes a traffic generation
  and testbed framework for synthetically generating different types of realistic
  DDoS attacks, FEs and other benign traffic traces, and monitoring their effects
  on the target. Using only modest hardware resources, the proposed framework, consisting
  of a customised software traffic generator, Botloader, is capable of generating
  a configurable mix of two-way traffic, for emulating either large-scale DDoS attacks,
  FEs or benign traffic traces that are experimentally reproducible. Botloader uses
  IP-aliasing, a well-known technique available on most computing platforms, to create
  thousands of interactive UDP/TCP endpoints on a single computer, each bound to a
  unique IP-address, to emulate large numbers of simultaneous attackers or benign
  clients.

ABS: 'Current network infrastructures exhibit low power efficiency, running network
  devices at full capacity all the time regardless of traffic demand. Power-aware
  traffic engineering schemes such as GreenTE improve network energy efficiency by
  adapting routing paths to traffic demand: when the demand is low, traffic is merged
  onto fewer links so that idle links can go to sleep, and when the demand is high,
  more links are being used to satisfy the demand. The effectiveness of this approach,
  however, depends on path diversity in the network. Existing research work considers
  only intra-domain part of routing paths, where both ingress point and egress point
  are fixed. It is unclear whether considering inter-domain path diversity would bring
  any additional power saving and by how much. In this paper we extend GreenTE to
  consider inter-domain path and quantify gains in power saving. By making egress
  point a variable in GreenTE, we are able to utilize more path diversity and get
  more power saving. Using network topologies from several wide-area networks, our
  evaluation shows that power saving increases when inter-domain paths are considered,
  but the amount of additional saving is modest, and depends on various factors.'

ABS: Decoy routing is a recently proposed approach for censorship circumvention. It
  relies on cooperating ISPs in the middle of the Internet to deploy the so called
  decoy routers that proxy network traffic from users in the censorship region. A
  recent study, published in an award-winning CCS 2012 paper [24], suggested that
  censors in highly connected countries like China can easily defeat decoy routing
  by selecting Internet routes that do not pass through the decoys. This attack is
  known as routing around decoys (RAD). In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis
  of the true costs of the RAD attack, based on actual Internet data. Our analysis
  takes into account not just the Internet topology, but also business relationships
  between ISPs, monetary and performance costs of different routes, etc. We demonstrate
  that even for the most vulnerable decoy placement assumed in the RAD study, the
  attack is likely to impose tremendous costs on the censoring ISPs. They will be
  forced to switch to much more costly routes and suffer from degradation in the quality
  of service. We then demonstrate that a more strategic placement of decoys will further
  increase the censors costs and render the RAD attack ineffective. We also show that
  the attack is even less feasible for censors in countries that are not as connected
  as China since they have many fewer routes to choose from. The first lesson of our
  study is that defeating decoy routing by simply selecting alternative Internet routes
  is likely to be prohibitively expensive for the censors. The second, even more important
  lesson is that a fine-grained, data-driven approach is necessary for understanding
  the true costs of various route selection mechanisms. Analyses based solely on the
  graph topology of the Internet may lead to mistaken conclusions about the feasibility
  of decoy routing and other censorship circumvention techniques based on interdomain
  routing.

ABS: Exponentially growing number of devices on Internet incurs an ever-increasing

  has recently become an unavoidable means to scale up the router performance. The
  research effort elaborated in this paper is focused on exploiting the modern trends
  of general-purpose computing on graphics processing unit computing in speeding up
  the execution of network protocols. An additional benefit is off-loading the CPU,
  which can now be fully dedicated to the packet processing and forwarding. To this
  end, the Shortest Path First algorithm in the Open Shortest Path First protocol
  and the choice of the best routes in the Border Gateway Protocol are parallelized
  for efficient execution on Compute Unified Device Architecture platform. An evaluation
  study was conducted on three different graphics processing units with representative
  network workload for a varying number of routes and devices. The obtained speedup
  results confirmed the viability and cost-effectiveness of such an approach.

ABS: Defense mechanisms against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks usually
  mitigate the attack by filtering out the excess traffic targeted at the victim.
  These defenses should be able to discriminate the attack from the legitimate traffic
  so that filtering can be selectively applied. The problem is exacerbated when spoofed
  addresses are used in attack packets. This paper proposes traceback-based distributed
  packet filter (TDPF), a novel distributed packet filtering mechanism that employs
  IP traceback as a means for traffic discrimination. In this defense mechanism, packet
  filters are relocated to the routers nearer the attack sources whenever the traceback
  algorithm adds such nodes to the attack tree. The filtering probabilities at packet
  filters are also dynamically adjusted to the volume of traffic the victim receives
  from each filtering router. In this way, TDPF is able to achieve a high throughput
  of legitimate traffic while blocking malicious flows. The burden it imposes on a
  participating router is negligible as well. Moreover, unlike the earlier traceback-based
  defenses, it can defend against intense DDoS attacks. Experimental results show
  that TDPF is effective in different attack scenarios.

ABS: Most organizations or CERTs deploy and operate Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)
  to carry out the security monitoring and response service. Although IDSs can contribute
  for defending our information property and crucial systems, they have a fatal drawback
  in that they are able to detect only known attacks that were matched to the predefined
  signatures. In our previous work, we proposed a security monitoring and response
  framework based on not only IDS alerts, but also darknet traffic. The proposed framework
  regards all incoming darknet packets that were not detected by IDSs as unknown attacks.
  In our further analysis, we recognized that not all of darknet traffic is related
  to the real attacks. In this paper, we propose an advanced classification method
  of darknet packets to effectively identify whether they were caused by the real
  attacks or not. With the proposed method, the security analyst can ignore the darknet
  packets that were not related to the real attacks. In fact, the experimental results
  show that it succeeded in removing 23.45% of unsuspicious darknet packets.

ABS: Traffic congestion in isolated complex networks has been investigated extensively
  over the last decade. Coupled network models have recently been developed to facilitate
  further understanding of real complex systems. Analysis of traffic congestion in
  coupled complex networks, however, is still relatively unexplored. In this paper,
  we try to explore the effect of interconnections on traffic congestion in interconnected
  BA scale-free networks. We find that assortative coupling can alleviate traffic
  congestion more readily than disassortative and random coupling when the node processing
  capacity is allocated based on node usage probability. Furthermore, the optimal
  coupling probability can be found for assortative coupling. However, three types
  of coupling preferences achieve similar traffic performance if all nodes share the
  same processing capacity. We analyze interconnected Internet AS-level graphs of
  South Korea and Japan and obtain similar results. Some practical suggestions are
  presented to optimize such real-world interconnected networks accordingly.

ABS: Hash tables are one of the most commonly used data structures in computing applications.
  They are used for example to organize a data set such that searches can be performed
  efficiently. The data stored in a hash table is commonly stored in memory and can
  suffer errors. To ensure that data stored in a memory is not corrupted when it suffers
  errors, Error Correction Codes (ECCs) are commonly used. In this research note a
  scheme to efficiently implement ECCs for the entries stored in hash tables is presented.
  The main idea is to use an ECC as the hash function that is used to construct the
  table. This eliminates the need to store the parity bits for the entries in the
  memory as they are implicit in the hash table construction thus reducing the implementation
  cost.

  Yes, say the authors, and they recommend that regulators address these possibly

ABS: Accurate IP geo-location is crucial to the effectiveness of a wide array of Internet-based
  services ranging from targeted advertising and website localization to content delivery,
  security logging and authentication. The most widely used technique for remote IP
  geo-location is to passively query a pre-built database mapping IP blocks to physical
  locations. Recent analysis of commercially available databases has revealed limited
  global coverage and limited accuracy below the country level. In this work, we first
  present a new form of geo-location technique which cross-references Regional Internet
  Registry (RIR) entries with topology information derived from Border Gateway Protocol
  (BGP) routing data. Second, we present a Hadoop integrated PATRICIA tree designed
  to store this dataset. Finally, we present a system for accurately and efficiently
  mapping location strings to representative alpha-shape polygons. Our experiments
  show that cross-referencing RIR entries with topology information allows for improvements
  in location accuracy below the country level in comparison with traditional databases.
  Furthermore, we show that use of a PATRICIA tree provides maximum storage efficiency
  with minimal performance impact. Finally, we show that representing locations as
  alpha shapes provides a high level of accuracy with minimal performance overhead.

ABS: Prevalent computing devices with networking capabilities have become critical
  cyber infrastructure for government, industry, academia and everyday life. As their
  value rises, the motivation driving cyber attacks on this infrastructure has shifted
  from the pursuit of notoriety to the pursuit of profit [1, 2] or political gains,
  leading to cyber terrorism on various scales. Cyber terrorism has had its share
  of case studies and definitions since late 1990s and early 2000s [3-5]. A common
  denominator of the definition of cyber terrorism is the threat posed through the
  use of cyber infrastructure, especially the Internet. Stuxnet, a malware discovered
  in June 2010, which was a directed attack against the Iranian nuclear program [6],
  represented a milestone on cyber warfare and posed a new challenge to analyze and
  understand cyber attacks due to its complexity in attack strategy. While cyber terrorism
  can have many elements beyond exploiting cyber vulnerabilities, this chapter focuses
  on analyzing techniques that process observables of malicious activities in the
  cyberspace.

ABS: In this paper, we present a novel approach to IP traceback - deterministic flow
  marking (DFM). We evaluate this novel approach against two well-known IP traceback
  schemes. These are the probabilistic packet marking (PPM) and the deterministic
  packet marking (DPM) techniques. In order to do so, we analyzed these techniques
  in detail in terms of their performances and feasibilities on five Internet traces.
  These traces consist of Darpa 1999 traffic traces, CAIDA October 2012 traffic traces,
  MAWI December 2012 traffic traces, and Dal2010 traffic traces. We have employed
  16 performance metrics to evaluate their performances. The empirical results show
  that the novel DFM technique can reduce the number of marked packets by 91% compared
  to the DPM, while achieving the same or better performance in terms of its ability
  to trace back the attack. Additionally, DFM provides an optional authentication
  so that a compromised router cannot forge markings of other uncompromised routers.
  Unlike PPM and DPM that trace the attack up to the ingress interface of the edge
  router close to the attacker, DFM allows the victim to trace the origin of incorrect
  or spoofed source addresses up to the attacker node, even if the attack has been
  originated from a network behind a network address translation (NAT) server. Our
  results show that DFM can reach up to approximately 99% traceback rate with no false
  positives.

ABS: Centrality measures are crucial in quantifying the roles and positions of vertices
  in complex network analysis. An important and popular measure is betweenness centrality,
  which is computed based on the number of shortest paths that vertices fall on. However,
  betweenness is computationally expensive to derive, resulting in much research on
  efficient computation techniques. We note that in many applications, it is the set
  of vertices with high betweenness that is of key interest and that their betweenness
  rankings rather than the exact values is usually adequate for analysts to work with.
  Hence, we have developed a novel algorithm that efficiently returns the set of vertices
  with highest betweenness. The convergence criterion for our algorithm is based on
  the membership stability of the high-betweenness set. Through experiments on various
  artificial and real-world networks, we show that the algorithm is both efficient
  and accurate. From the experiments, we also demonstrated that the algorithm tends
  to perform better on networks with heterogeneous betweenness distributions.

ABS: Large-scale botnet attacks against Internet links using low-rate flows cannot
  be effectively countered by any of the traditional rate-limiting and flow-filtering
  mechanisms deployed in individual routers. In this paper, we present a collaborative
  defense mechanism, called CoDef, which enables routers to distinguish low-rate attack
  flows from legitimate flows, and protect legitimate traffic during botnet attacks.
  CoDef enables autonomous domains that are uncontaminated by bots to collaborate
  during link flooding attacks and reroute their customers legitimate traffic in response
  to requests from congested routers. Collaborative defense using multi-path routing
  favors legitimate traffic while limiting the bandwidth available to attack traffic
  at a congested link. We present CoDefs design and evaluate its effectiveness by
  exploring the domain-level path-diversity of the Internet and performing simulations
  under various traffic conditions.

ABS: A comprehensive understanding of outage threats is critical for robust network
  design and operation, and evaluating cost trade-offs for recovery planning. In this
  paper, we describe a study of network infrastructure events due to outage events
  and a framework for mitigating these risks through backup routing and additional
  provisioning. We evaluate risk via the concept of bit-risk miles, the geographically-scaled
  outage risk of traffic in a network. Our focus on bit-risk miles allows for first-of-its-kind
  analysis of the tradeoffs of shortest path routing and risk-averse routing. We leverage
  the concept of bit-risk miles to present RiskRoute, a flexible routing framework
  that allows for backup routes to be configured to respond to both historical and
  immediately forecasted outage threats. Specifically, RiskRoute is an optimization
  framework that minimizes bit-risk miles between arbitrary points in a network. RiskRoute
  also reveals the best locations for provisioning additional network infrastructure
  in the form of new PoP-to-PoP links for single-network domains, and the best new
  peering relationships for multi-network domains. To assess and evaluate RiskRoute,
  we assemble diverse datasets including (i) - detailed topological maps and peering
  relationships of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the US, and (ii) - historical
  information on different types of natural disasters which threaten physical infrastructure.
  Our analysis reveals the providers that have the highest risk to disaster-based
  outage events. We also provide provisioning recommendations for network operators
  that can in some cases significantly lower bit-risk miles for their infrastructures.

ABS: Botnets are networks of computers which have been compromised by malicious software
  which enables a remotely located adversary to control them and focus their collective
  power on specific tasks. Botnets pose a significant global threat, with tangible
  political, economic and military ramifications and have resultingly become a field
  of significant interest within the cyber-security research community. While a number
  of effective defence techniques have been devised for botnets utilizing centralized
  command and control infrastructures, few of these techniques are suitable for defending
  against larger-scale peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets. In contrast, the sybil attack,
  combined with index poisoning is an established defence technique for P2P botnets.
  During a sybil attack, fake bots (ie sybils) are inserted into the botnet. These
  sybils distribute fake commands to bots, causing them not to carry out illicit activities.
  Bots also then unwittingly redistribute the fake commands to other bots in the botnet.
  This work uses packet-level simulation of a Kademlia-based P2P botnet to evaluate
  1) the impact that the location of sybils within the underlying network topology
  can have on the effectiveness of sybil attacks and 2) several potential optimizations
  to the placement of sybils within the underlying network topology.

ABS: Statistical models for networks have been typically committed to strong prior
  assumptions concerning the form of the modeled distributions. Moreover, the vast
  majority of currently available models are explicitly designed for capturing some
  specific graph properties (such as power-law degree distributions), which makes
  them unsuitable for application to domains where the behavior of the target quantities
  is not known a priori. The key contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we
  introduce the Fiedler delta statistic, based on the Laplacian spectrum of graphs,
  which allows to dispense with any parametric assumption concerning the modeled network
  properties. Second, we use the defined statistic to develop the Fiedler random field
  model, which allows for efficient estimation of edge distributions over large-scale
  random networks. After analyzing the dependence structure involved in Fiedler random
  fields, we estimate them over several real-world networks, showing that they achieve
  a much higher modeling accuracy than other well-known statistical approaches.

ABS: In high-speed network monitoring, the ever-growing traffic calls for a high-performance

  the current commodity multi-core processors opens up new opportunities in parallelization.
  In this paper, we present a novel precision integrated framework (PRIF) that exploits
  the great parallel capability of multi-cores to speed up the famous frequent algorithm.
  PRIF equally distributes the input data stream into sub-threads that use the optimized
  weighted frequent algorithm to track local frequent items. The items with frequency
  increments exceeding a pre-defined threshold are sent to a merging thread which
  is able to return the global continuous epsilon-deficient frequent items. The theoretical
  correctness and complexity analyses are presented. Experiments with real and synthetic
  traces confirm the theoretical analyses and demonstrate the excellent performance
  as well as the effects of parameters and data skewness. The results show that PRIF
  is able to provide continuous frequent items and near-linear speedup at the cost
  of greater memory use.

ABS: We present a new technique, which we call socket overloading, that we apply for
  off-path attacks on DNS. Socket overloading consists of short, low-rate, bursts
  of inbound packets, sent by off-path attacker to a victim host. Socket overloading
  exploits the priority assigned by the kernel to hardware interrupts, and enables
  an off-path attacker to illicit a side-channel on client hosts, which can be applied
  to circumvent source port and name server randomisation. Both port and name server
  randomisation are popular and standardised defenses, recommended in [RFC5452], against
  attacks by offpath adversaries. We show how to apply socket overloading for DNS
  cache poisoning and name server pinning against popular systems that support algorithms
  recommended in [RFC6056] and [RFC4097] respectively. Our socket overloading technique
  may be of independent interest, and can be applied against other protocols for different
  attacks.

ABS: The advantage of graph-based anomaly detection is that the relationships between
  elements can be analyzed for structural oddities that could represent activities
  such as fraud, network intrusions, or suspicious associations in a social network.
  However, current approaches to detecting anomalies in graphs are computationally
  expensive and do not scale to large graphs. For instance, in the case of computer
  network traffic, a graph representation of the traffic might consist of nodes representing
  computers and edges representing communications between the corresponding computers.
  However, computer network traffic is typically voluminous, or acquired in real-time
  as a stream of information. In this work, we describe methods for graph-based anomaly
  detection via graph partitioning and windowing, and demonstrate their ability to
  efficiently detect anomalies in data represented as a graph.

ABS: The position of the nodes within a network topology largely determines the level

  yield very different views of their relative significance. Our first contribution
  in this paper is then an exhaustive survey and categorization of centrality indices
  along several attributes including the type of information (local vs. global) and
  processing complexity required for their computation. We next study the seven most
  popular of those indices in the context of Internet vulnerability to address issues
  that remain under-explored in literature so far. First, we carry out a correlation
  study to assess the consistency of the node rankings those indices generate over
  ISP router-level topologies. For each pair of indices, we compute the full ranking
  correlation, which is the standard choice in literature, and the percentage overlap
  between the k top nodes. Then, we let these rankings guide the removal of highly
  central nodes and assess the impact on both the connectivity properties and traffic-carrying
  capacity of the network. Our results confirm that the top-k overlap predicts the
  comparative impact of indices on the network vulnerability better than the full-ranking
  correlation. Importantly, the locally computed degree centrality index approximates
  closely the global indices with the most dramatic impact on the traffic-carrying
  capacity; whereas, its approximative power in terms of connectivity is more topology-dependent.

ABS: IP flow analysis is an effective way of doing network forensic analysis which
  aims to detect attack patterns and identify attackers in a given network traffic
  data. For attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), efficiently identifying
  the botnet in time can be a challenge. Recently, the unsupervised learning methods
  such as the K-means, self-organizing map (SOM), and growing hierarchical self-organizing
  map (GHSOM) have been shown to be able to facilitate network anomaly detection.
  However, there is no study focusing on mining IP flows with high variability of
  attacks in an intuitive way. In this study, we leverage the visualization specialty
  of GHSOM to help analyze the static IP flow data, also called the network traces
  of victims, to identify any suspicious IP source. The GHSOM can generate a hierarchical
  architecture based on the input data and help reveal their inherent hierarchical
  relationships. For example, the geometric distances between each attack pattern
  and its descriptive information are revealed in the topological space which forms
  the signature of a botnet. The IP flows clustered by GHSOM are grouped with distinctive
  connecting features, and the differences between each cluster are visualized with
  sequential time stamps which can be used to portray various attack patterns, help
  explore the sources of attacks and understand the behaviors of attacks. The experimental
  results from real-world traffic data show that forensic analysis using GHSOM can
  efficiently identify several DDoS attack patterns and generate filtering rules for
  intrusion detection system (IDS) by further inspecting and book marking the suspicious
  IP sources.

ABS: 'Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are considered to be among the
  most crucial security challenges in current networks because they significantly
  disrupt the availability of a service by consuming extreme amount of resource and/or
  by creating link congestions. One type of countermeasure against DDoS attacks is
  a filter-based approach where filter-based intermediate routers within the network
  coordinate with each other to filter undesired flows. The key to success for this
  approach is effective filter propagation and management techniques. However, existing
  filter-based approaches do not consider effective filter propagation and management.
  In this paper, we define three necessary properties for a viable DDoS solution:
  how to practically propagate filters, how to place filters to effective filter routers,
  and how to manage filters to maximize the efficacy of the defense. We propose a
  novel mechanism, called Adaptive Probabilistic Filter Scheduling (APFS), that effectively
  defends against DDoS attacks and also satisfies the three necessary properties.
  In APFS, a filter router adaptively calculates its own marking probability based
  on three factors: 1) hop count from a sender, 2) the filter routers resource availability,
  and 3) the filter routers link degree. That is, a filter router that is closer to
  attackers, has more available resources, or has more connections to neighbors inserts
  its marking with a higher probability. These three factors lead a victim to receive
  more markings from more effective filter routers, and thus, filters are quickly
  distributed to effective filter routers. Moreover, each filter router manages multiple
  filters using a filter scheduling policy that allows it to selectively keep the
  most effective filters depending on attack situations. Experimental results show
  that APFS has a faster filter propagation and a higher attack blocking ratio than
  existing approaches that use fixed marking probability. In addition, APFS has a
  44% higher defense effectiveness than existing filter-based approaches that do not
  use a filter scheduling policy.'

ABS: The Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) traffic model is important because it captures
  the self-similar characteristics of Internet traffic, accurately represents traffic
  generated as an aggregate of many sources, which is a prevalent characteristic of
  many Internet traffic streams, and, as we show in this paper, it is amenable to
  analysis. This paper introduces a new, simple, closed-form approximation for the
  stationary workload distribution (virtual waiting time) of a single server queue
  fed by an fBm input. Next, an efficient approach for producing a sequence of simulations
  with finer and finer detail of the fBm process is introduced and applied to demonstrate
  good agreement between the new formula and the simulation results. This method is
  necessary in order to ensure that the discrete-time simulation accurately models
  the continuous-time fBm queueing process. Then we study the limitations of the fBm
  process as a traffic model using two benchmark models -- the Poisson Pareto Burst
  Process model and a truncated version of the fBm. We determine by numerical experiments
  the region where the fBm can serve as an accurate traffic model. These experiments
  show that when the level of multiplexing is sufficient, fBm is an accurate model
  for the traffic on links in the core of an internet. Using our result for the workload
  distribution, we derive a closed-form expression for service rate provisioning when
  the desired blocking probability as a measure of quality of service is given, and
  apply this result to a range of examples. Finally, we validate our fBm-based overflow
  probability and link dimensioning formulae using results based on a queue fed by
  a real traffic trace as a benchmark and demonstrate an advantage for the range of
  overflow probability below 1% over traffic modelling based on the Markov modulated
  Poisson process.

ABS: The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is critical to the global internet infrastructure.
  Unfortunately BGP routing was designed with limited regard for security. As a result,
  IP route hijacking has been observed for more than 15 years. Well known incidents
  include a 2008 hijack of YouTube, loss of connectivity for Australia in 2012, and
  an event that partially crippled Google in November 2012. The extent of an IP Hijack
  can be localized to a small region or can propagate to become a world-wide event.
  Concern has been escalating as critical national infrastructure is reliant on a
  secure foundation for the internet. Disruptions to military, banking, utilities,
  industry, and commerce can be catastrophic. The paper addresses the question of
  why some autonomous systems are more prone to attack than others. We present a series
  of findings related to the manner in which IP hijacks propagate through the global
  routing infrastructure. We examine why some attacks extend widely while others remain
  isolated and explore topological patterns that enhance or inhibit attacks.

ABS: This paper presents BGPfuse, a scheme for visualizing and exploring BGP (Border
  Gateway Protocol) path change anomalies. BGPfuse uses a set of BGP features that
  are capable of quantifying the degree of anomaly of each path change event. Moreover,
  visual methods are introduced for performing the efficient fusion of these multiple
  features. The exploitation of the human perception, allows to overcome the static-nature
  of the existing weight-based fusion approaches. A Parallel Coordinates approach
  is used to visualize these features, which is further enhanced with filtering capabilities,
  so as to discriminate between normal and abnormal events. BGPfuse uses multiple
  linked graph views so as to represent in depth the relationships among the involved
  Autonomous Systems (ASes), as well as a combined graph view to highlight structural
  similarities between all the individual feature graphs. The structural similarities
  as well as the filtering capabilities provided by BGPfuse, enable the analyst to
  perform visual fusion of the BGP features, so as to detect any suspicious behavior
  and focus only in the most interesting cases. Experimental demonstration of BGPfuse,
  shows the analytical potential of the proposed approach by decisively capturing
  malicious BGP hijacking events.

ABS: While accurate and complete modeling of the Internet topology at the Autonomous

  simulation and analysis, still it remains a challenge to construct its accurate
  representation. In this paper, we collect BGP route announcements of ASes from Looking
  glass (LG) servers. By querying LG servers, we build an AS topology estimate of
  around 116 K AS links, from which we discover 11 K new AS links and 686 new ASes.
  We conclude that collecting BGP traces from LG servers can help enhance the current
  view of the AS topology from the BGP collector projects (e.g., RouteViews).

ABS: 'Content distribution systems have traditionally adopted one of two architectures:
  infrastructure-based content delivery networks (CDNs), in which clients download

  clients download content from each other. The advantages and disadvantages of each
  architecture have been studied in great detail. Recently, hybrid, or peer-assisted,
  CDNs have emerged, which combine elements from both architectures. The properties
  of such systems, however, are not as well understood. In this paper, we discuss
  the potential risks and benefits of peer-assisted CDNs, and we study one specific
  instance, Akamais NetSession system, to examine the impact of these risks and benefits
  in practice. NetSession is a mature system that has been operating commercially
  since 2010 and currently has more than 25 million users in 239 countries and territories.
  Our results show that NetSession can deliver several of the key benefits of both
  infrastructure-based and peer-to-peer CDNs -- for instance, it can offload 70-80%
  of the traffic to the peers without a corresponding loss of performance or reliability
  -- and that the risks can be managed well. This suggests that hybrid designs may

ABS: New applications such as soft real-time data center applications, algorithmic
  trading, and high-performance computing require extremely low latency (in microseconds)
  from networks. Network operators today lack sufficient fine-grain measurement tools
  to detect, localize, and repair delay spikes that cause application service level
  agreement (SLA) violations. A recently proposed solution called LDA provides a scalable
  way to obtain latency, but only provides aggregate measurements. However, debugging
  application-specific problems requires per-flow measurements since different flows
  may exhibit significantly different characteristics even when they are traversing
  the same link. To enable fine-grained per-flow measurements in routers, we propose
  a new scalable architecture called reference latency interpolation (RLI) that is
  based on our observation that packets potentially belonging to different flows that
  are closely spaced to each other exhibit similar delay properties. In our evaluation
  using simulations over real traces, we show that while having small overhead, RLI
  achieves a median relative error of 12% and one to two orders of magnitude higher
  accuracy than previous per-flow measurement solutions. We also observe RLI achieves
  as high accuracy as LDA in aggregate latency estimation, and RLI outperforms LDA
  in standard deviation estimation.

ABS: Lately, there has been an upsurge of interest in compressed data structures,
  aiming to pack ever larger quantities of information into constrained memory without
  sacrificing the efficiency of standard operations, like random access, search, or
  update. The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate how data compression can benefit
  the networking community, by showing how to squeeze the IP Forwarding Information
  Base (FIB), the giant table consulted by IP routers to make forwarding decisions,
  into information-theoretical entropy bounds, with essentially zero cost on longest
  prefix match and FIB update. First, we adopt the state-of-the-art in compressed
  data structures, yielding a static entropy-compressed FIB representation with asymptotically
  optimal lookup. Then, we re-design the venerable prefix tree, used commonly for
  IP lookup for at least 20 years in IP routers, to also admit entropy bounds and
  support lookup in optimal time and update in nearly optimal time. Evaluations on
  a Linux kernel prototype indicate that our compressors encode a FIB comprising more
  than 440K prefixes to just about 100-400 KBytes of memory, with a threefold increase
  in lookup throughput and no penalty on FIB updates.

ABS: Everyone is concerned about Internet security, yet most traffic is not cryptographically
  protected. Typical justification is that most attackers are off-path and cannot
  intercept traffic; hence, intuitively, challenge-response defenses should suffice
  to ensure authenticity. Often, the challenges re-use existing header fields to protect
  widely-deployed protocols such as TCP and DNS. We argue that this practice may often
  give an illusion of security. We review recent off-path TCP injection and DNS poisoning
  attacks, enabling attackers to circumvent existing challenge-response defenses.
  Both TCP and DNS attacks are non-trivial, yet practical. The attacks foil widely
  deployed security mechanisms, and allow a wide range of exploits, such as long-term
  caching of malicious objects and scripts. We hope that this review article will
  help improve defenses against off-path attackers. In particular, we hope to motivate,
  when feasible, adoption of cryptographic mechanisms such as SSL/TLS, IPsec and DNSSEC,
  providing security even against stronger Man-in-the-Middle attackers.

ABS: With ever increasing network traffic rates, multicore architectures for network
  processors have successfully provided performance improvements through high parallelism.
  However, naively allocating the network traffic to multiple cores without considering
  diversified applications and flow locality results in issues such as packet reordering,
  load imbalance and inefficient cache usage. Consequently, these issues degrade the
  performance of latency sensitive network processors by dropping packets or delivering
  packets out of order. In this paper, we propose a packet scheduling scheme that
  considers the multiple dimensions of locality to improve the throughput of a network
  processor while minimizing out of order packets. Our scheduling policy tries to
  maintain packet order by maintaining the flow locality, minimizes the migration
  of flows from one core to another by identifying the aggressive flows, and partitions
  the cores among multiple services to gain instruction cache locality. The scheduler
  uses a novel low cost two-level caching scheme to identify top aggressive flows.
  Our light weight hardware implementation shows improvement of 60% in the number
  of packets dropped and 80% improvement in the out-of-order packet deliveries over
  previously proposed techniques.

  is to characterize this condition in terms of the network topology and the number/placement
  of monitors, under the constraint that measurement paths must be cycle-free. Our
  main results are: (i) it is generally impossible to identify all the link metrics
  by using two monitors; (ii) nevertheless, metrics of all the interior links not
  incident to any monitor are identifiable by two monitors if the topology satisfies
  a set of necessary and sufficient connectivity conditions; (iii) these conditions
  naturally extend to a necessary and sufficient condition for identifying all the
  link metrics using three or more monitors. We show that these conditions not only
  allow efficient identifiability tests, but also enable an efficient algorithm to

ABS: The cost of a single zero-day network worm outbreak on the global Internet has
  been estimated at US$2.6 billion. In addition, zero-day network worm outbreaks have
  been observed that spread at a significant pace across the Internet, with an observed
  infection proportion of more than 90% of vulnerable hosts within 10 minutes. The
  threat posed by such fast-spreading malware to defence systems and national security
  is therefore significant, particularly given the fact that network operator/administrator
  intervention is not likely to take effect within the typical epidemiological timescale
  of such infections. An accepted technology that is used to research the security
  threat presented by zero-day worms is that of simulation systems; however, only
  a subset of these focus on the Internet and issues persist regarding how representative
  these are of the Internet. The design of a novel simulator developed to address
  these issues, the Internet Worm Simulator (IWS), is presented along with experimental
  results for a selection of previous worm outbreaks compared against observed, empirical
  data and hypothetical outbreak scenarios. Based on a finite state machine for each
  network host, the IWS incorporates the dynamic, heterogeneous characteristics of
  the Internet and, on a single workstation, is able to simulate an IPv4-sized network.
  Based on the analysis presented, the authors conclude that the IWS has the capability
  to simulate zero-day worm epidemiology on the dynamic, heterogeneous Internet for
  a variety of scenarios. These include simulating previous worm outbreaks that demonstrate
  random-scanning and hit list behaviour, as well as hypothetical scenarios that include
  a large susceptible populous and stealth-like behaviour.

ABS: Operators use link dimensioning to provision network links. In practice, traffic
  averages are obtained via SNMP are used to roughly estimate required capacity. More
  accurate solutions often require traffic statistics easily obtained from packet
  captures, e.g. variance. However, packet capturing may not be trivial in high-speed
  links. Aiming scalability, operators often deploy packet sampling on monitoring,
  but little is known how it affects link dimensioning. In this paper we assess the
  feasibility of lightweight link dimensioning using sFlow, which is a widely-deployed
  traffic monitoring tool. We implement sFlow sampling algorithm and use a previously
  proposed and validated dimensioning formula that needs traffic variance. We validate
  our approach using packet captures from real networks. Results show that the proposed
  procedure is successful for a range of sampling rates and that, due to randomness
  of sampling algorithm, the error introduced by scaling the traffic variance yields
  more conservative results that cope with short-term traffic fluctuations.

ABS: With the enormous growth in network connectivity resulting in high bandwidth
  Internet services, and huge increase in the number of Internet-based applications,
  network security is becoming increasingly important. Almost all computer systems
  suffer from security vulnerabilities which are economically costly and impossible
  to be solved by manufacturers alone. Therefore, the role of intrusion detection
  systems as special purpose applications to detect anomalies and attacks in a network,
  is becoming very important. Traditional intrusion detection systems are reactive
  in the sense that they use a set of signatures to identify malicious traffic patterns;
  the size of the signature set grows as new vulnerabilities are discovered. Anomaly
  detection systems are a category of intrusion detection systems that act more proactively.
  They derive a model of the normal system behavior and issue alarms whenever the
  behavior changes, making a stable assumption that such changes are frequently caused
  by malicious or disruptive events. Anomaly detection has been a field of intense
  research over the years as it poses many challenging problems. Data mining techniques
  have proven to be useful in effective identification of anomalous traffic patterns.The
  contributions of this thesis pertain to the area of network traffic anomaly detection
  using data mining techniques. This thesis has three parts including background and
  literature review, a systematic approach to generate real-life network intrusion
  datasets, and approaches for network anomaly detection. In the first part, it presents
  an overview of networks attack, a taxonomy and categories of detection methods with
  architectures, and an extensive review of network anomaly detection methods, systems
  and tools. In the second part, it introduces a systematic approach to generate real-life
  network intrusion datasets using the TUIDS testbed architecture, such up-to-date
  datasets are useful for the network security research community to test detection
  methods and systems. In the third part, this thesis introduces approaches for network
  anomaly detection. It presents an outlier-based approach by introducing an outlier
  score function to rank each candidate object and report traffic patterns as normal
  or coordinated scan as early as possible. This thesis includes a tree-based subspace
  clustering technique for high dimensional large datasets. It generates reference
  points to estimate outlier score values to detect large scale network anomalies.
  This thesis also includes an unsupervised approach for network anomaly detection
  in large datasets with a focus on detection of known as well as unknown attacks
  without using any labelled traffic or signatures or training. The approach includes
  two algorithms, viz., TreeCLUSS and CLUSSLab. CLUSSLab is an effective cluster labelling
  technique to label each cluster based on a stable cluster set obtained from TreeCLUSS
  using multiple objectives. It also presents an effective unsupervised feature clustering
  technique to identify a dominant feature subset for each cluster, to be used for
  cluster labelling. Finally, this thesis includes an extended entropy metric-based
  DDoS flooding attack detection approach to detect four classes DDoS attacks, viz.,
  constant rate, pulsing rate, increasing rate and subgroup attacks. It can successfully
  identify the DDoS attacks by measuring the metric difference between legitimate
  traffic and attack traffic using extended entropy metric. This approach also extends
  the mechanism to use an ensemble of extended entropy metrics for increasing detection
  rate in near real-time. The proposed techniques are validated using real-life datasets
  and have been found to perform well in comparison to competing algorithms. All network
  anomaly detection algorithms have been validated in terms of detection rate, false
  positive rate, ROC, precision, recall and F-measure.

ABS: A simple model of service rate control system is presented that may be used to
  design energy-aware control rules for the processors capable of adjusting their
  operating capabilities to the observed workload. The model exploits a bi-objective
  processing performance index aggregating the cost of energy consumption and the
  cost of service delivery. An approximate solution to the related stochastic optimal
  control problem is presented. Based on the obtained results a collection of CPU
  frequency control governors for the Linux kernel was designed and implemented. Performance
  of the designed controllers was next experimentally compared to the performance
  of the Linux cpufreq_ondemand governor. The obtained results suggest ways to improve
  efficiency of the Linux kernel CPU frequency control mechanisms. A brief description
  of the experimental environment is given.

ABS: By measuring network changes, we can get a better understanding of a network.
  Extending this to the Internet, we are able to understand the constantly occuring
  changes on an international scale. In this research, we propose a measure that conveys
  the relative magnitude of the change between two networks (i.e., Internet topology).
  The measure is normalised and intuitively gives an indication of whether the change
  is small or large. We start off by applying this measure to standard common graphs,
  as well as random graphs. These graphs were first simulated and the measurements
  taken; results were then proved theoretically. These corresponded to the simulation
  results, thus demonstrating correctness. For case studies, we compared actual implemented
  networks with that which is inferred by probes. This comparison was done to study
  how accurate the probes were in discovering actual network topology. Finally, we
  conducted real-world experiments by applying the measurements to certain segments
  of the Internet. We observed that the measurements indeed do pick up events which
  significantly influenced structural changes to the Internet.

ABS: Passive TCP session reconstruction essential for many kinds of network forensics
  and law enforcement operations, but it is is complicated by packet loss, retransmissions,
  and possible attacks by adversaries. The key problem is that participants in the
  TCP session may observe the TCP segments differently than the monitor. An Added
  complication is the lack of familiarity with network protocols by many forensic
  analysts, resulting in the need for tools that are easy-to-use and able to tolerate
  a wide range of data. To address these issues we rewrote the open source network
  forensics tool tcpflow, making it more robust to anomalies that had been reported
  to us by users. We also improved the programs usability and performance on large
  packet captures, and added simple visualization that produces a one-page summary

GEOLOC: Potsdam, GE; London, UK
ABS: 'The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the core routing protocol in the Internet.
  It maintains reachability information towards IP networks, called prefixes. The
  adoption of BGP has come at a price: a steady growth in the routing table size (Meng
  et al., 2005) [1] as well as BGP updates (Cittadini et al., 2010) [2]. In this work,
  we take a different look at BGP updates, by quantifying the amount of prefix correlation
  in the BGP updates received by different routers in the Internet. We design a method
  to classify sets of BGP updates, called spikes, into either correlated or non-correlated,
  by comparing streams of BGP updates from multiple vantage points. Based on publicly
  available data, we show that a significant fraction of all BGP updates are correlated.
  Most of these correlated spikes contain updates for a few BGP prefixes only. When
  studying the topological scope of the correlated spikes, we find that they are relatively
  global given the limited AS hop distance between most ASs in the Internet, i.e.,
  they propagate at least 2 or 3 AS hops away. Most BGP updates visible from publicly
  available vantage points are therefore related to small events that propagate across
  multiple AS hops in the Internet, while a limited fraction of the BGP updates appear
  in large bursts that stay mostly localised. Our results shed light on a fundamental
  while often misunderstood aspect of BGP, namely the correlation between BGP updates
  and how it impacts our beliefs about the share of local and global BGP events in
  the Internet. Our work differs from the literature in that we try as much as possible
  to explicitly account in our methodology for the visibility of BGP vantage points,
  and its implication on the actual claims that can be made from the data.'

ABS: 'Raw Cyber attack traffic can present more questions than answers to security

  This work proposes online processing to simultaneously model coordinating actors
  and segment traffic that is relevant to a target of interest, all while it is being
  received. The goal is not just to aggregate similar attack behaviors, but to provide
  situational awareness by grouping potential coordinators and isolating an attack
  area of interest around a particular target. The clustering problem is recast as
  a supervised learning problem: classifying received traffic to the most likely attack
  model, and iteratively introducing new attack models to explain received traffic.
  A novel graphical prior probability is defined based on the macroscopic attack structure
  to improve classification. Malicious traffic captures provided by the Cooperative
  Association for Internet Data Analysis are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the
  online model generation and segmentation.'

  Our algorithm considers the degree information of nodes and of their neighbors to
  combine consensus in order to model how reputations travel within the network. In
  our algorithm, each node updates reputations on its neighbors by considering past
  interactions, computing the velocity of the interactions to measure how frequent
  the interactions have been occurring recently, and adjusting the feedback values
  according to the velocity of the interaction. The algorithm also captures the phenomena
  of accuracy of reputations decaying over time if interactions have not occurred
  recently. We present two contributions through experiments: (1) We show that an
  agents reputation value is influenced by the position of the agent in the network

ABS: DNSSEC extends DNS with a public-key infrastructure, providing compatible clients
  with cryptographic assurance for DNS records they obtain, even in the presence of
  an active network attacker. As with many Internet protocol deployments, administrators
  deciding whether to deploy DNSSEC for their DNS zones must perform cost/benefit
  analysis. For some fraction of clients -- those that perform DNSSEC validation --
  the zone will be protected from malicious hijacking. But another fraction of clients
  -- those whose DNS resolvers are buggy and incompatible with DNSSEC -- will no longer
  be able to connect to the zone. Deploying DNSSEC requires making a cost-benefit
  decision, balancing security for some users with denial of service for others. We
  have performed a large-scale measurement of the effects of DNSSEC on client name
  resolution using an ad network to collect results from over 500,000 geographically-distributed
  clients. Our findings corroborate those of previous researchers in showing that
  a relatively small fraction of users are protected by DNSSEC-validating resolvers.
  And we show, for the first time, that enabling DNSSEC measurably increases end-to-end
  resolution failures. For every 10 clients that are protected from DNS tampering
  when a domain deploys DNSSEC, approximately one ordinary client (primarily in Asia)
  becomes unable to access the domain.

ABS: 'The dependence of society on Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
  over the past decade has brought with it an increased vulnerability to Distributed
  Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks harness the power of thousands,
  and sometimes tens or hundreds of thousands of compromised computers to attack information-providing
  web-services and online trading sites, resulting in significant down-time and financial
  losses. Consequently, the study of DDoS attacks, and the development of techniques
  to accurately and reliably detect and mitigate their impact is an important area
  of research. One particular challenge in detecting such attacks is distinguishing
  them from similar looking Flash Events (FEs), which occur when a server experiences
  an unexpected surge of requests from its legitimate clients. Distinguishing DDoS
  attacks from FEs is important because each requires a different set of actions to
  be undertaken by a network administrator. However, developing and investigating
  realistic techniques to distinguish between the two is complicated by an extreme
  lack of experimental datasets that record representative real traffic, whether attack
  or benign. The work presented in this thesis addresses the above challenges and
  makes a number of related contributions. The first contribution of the thesis is
  the design of a DDoS attack detection technique based on the change in the rate
  of previously unseen source IP addresses (IPs) of the incoming packets, and its
  proof-of-concept implementation. Using this simple feature of source IPs provides
  good scalability at higher network speeds. The second contribution is the design
  and implementation of a model that provides the foundation for both detecting and
  synthesising Flash Events. The detection part is based on the subtle differences
  between DDoS attacks and FEs. Analysing two widely used and publicly available datasets,
  representing a DDoS attack and an FE, three parametric differences between DDoS
  attacks and FEs are identified: change in the rate of incoming traffic, change in
  the rate of new source IP addresses, and the distribution of requests among source
  IPs. With a view to synthetic generation of FEs, the model classifies them into
  three broad categories: predictable, unpredictable and secondary, and describes
  each type via three key components: a) the volume of incoming traffic, b) the number
  of source IP addresses, and c) the resources being accessed. The third contribution
  is the design and experimental implementation of an ensemble-based DDoS attack detection
  technique. The proposed technique combines the analysis of both network traffic
  features and server load characteristics to detect a wide range of network and application
  layer DDoS attacks and to effectively distinguish them from FEs. The fourth contribution
  of the thesis is a traffic generation and testbed framework, cooperatively developed
  as part of this research, to synthetically generate different types of DDoS attacks
  and FEs, and to monitor their effects on the target. The testbed makes use of modest
  hardware through the exploitation of IP aliasing, a well-known technique available
  on most computing platforms, to generate synthetic benign and attack traffic originating
  from a wide range of valid IP addresses.'

ABS: 'Network Processors are multicore processors capable of processing network packets
  at wire speeds of multi-Gbps. Due to their high performance and programmability,
  these processors have become the main computing elements in many demanding network
  processing equipments like enterprise, edge and core routers. With the ever increasing
  use of the internet, the processing demands of these routers have also increased.
  As a result, the number and complexity of the cores in network processors have also
  increased. Hence, efficiently managing these cores has become very challenging.
  This dissertation discusses two main issues related to efficient usage of large
  number of parallel cores in network processors: (1) How to allocate work to the
  processing cores to optimize performance? (2) How to meet the desired performance
  requirement power efficiently? This dissertation presents the design of a hash based
  scheduler to distribute packets to cores. The scheduler exploits multiple dimensions
  of locality to improve performance while minimizing out of order delivery of packets.
  This scheduler is designed to work seamlessly when the number of cores allocated
  to a service is changed. The design of a resource allocator is also presented which
  allocates different number of cores to services with changing traffic behavior.
  To improve the power efficiency, a traffic aware power management scheme is presented
  which exploits variations in traffic rates to save power. The results of simulation
  studies are presented to evaluate the proposals using real and synthetic network
  traces. These experiments show that the proposed packet scheduler can improve performance
  by as much as 40% by improving locality. It is also observed that traffic variations
  can be exploited to save significant power by turning off the unused cores or by
  running them at lower frequencies. Improving performance of the individual cores
  by careful scheduling also helps to reduce the power consumption because the same
  amount of work can now be done with fewer cores with improved performance. The proposals
  made in this dissertation show promising improvements over the previous work. Hashing
  based schedulers have very low overhead and are very suitable for data rates of
  100 Gbps and even beyond.'

ABS: Web 2.0 changed the interaction paradigm of Internet users, placing them in a
  more active role as both producers and consumers of digital contents. This concept
  has also triggered the appearance of social networks and cloud computing services,
  which have an increasing contribution to the total traffic amount. The increasing
  Internet complexity brings new challenges to network operators and managers, which
  need to understand new applications and know the exact properties of the generated
  traffic. The ability to accurately map traffic patterns to their corresponding application
  can be used to build efficient traffic and user profiles, which can be extremely
  helpful in several critical tasks like network resources optimization, service differentiation
  and personalization, network management and security. This paper proposes a classification
  approach that is able to accurately differentiate traffic flows in a core network
  and associate them with their underlying applications, allowing the construction
  of accurate traffic and user profiles. By performing a wavelet decomposition and
  analyzing the obtained scalograms, the captured traffic can be fully characterized
  in terms of its time and frequency components. As the different frequency components
  of the traffic are inferred, an appropriate communication profile characteristic
  of each application type can be defined. This way, it is possible to identify the
  distinct applications that are being used by the different connected clients and
  build useful user profiles.

ABS: Previous work on network measurements have explored several primitives of increasing
  complexity for measurement tasks at individual nodes, ranging from counters to hashing
  to arbitrary code fragments. In an SDN network, these primitives may require significant
  bandwidth, memory and processing resources, and the resources dedicated to these
  can affect the accuracy of the eventual measurement. In this paper, we first qualitatively
  discuss the tradeoff space of resource usage versus accuracy for these different
  primitives as a function of the spatial and temporal measurement granularity, then
  quantify these tradeoffs in the context of hierarchical heavy hitter detection.

ABS: Over the past decade, the Cyberspace has seen an increasing number of attacks
  coming from botnets using the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture. Peer-to-Peer botnets
  use a decentralized Command and Control architecture. Moreover, a large number of
  such botnets already exist, and newer versions- which significantly differ from
  their parent bot- are also discovered practically every year. In this work, the
  authors propose and implement a novel hybrid framework for detecting P2P botnets
  in live network traffic by integrating Neural Networks with Bayesian Regularization.
  Bayesian Regularization helps in achieving better generalization of the dataset,
  thereby enabling the detection of botnet activity even of those bots which were
  never used in training the Neural Network. Hence such a framework is suitable for
  detection of newer and unseen botnets in live traffic of a network. This was verified
  by testing the Framework on test data unseen to the Detection module (using untrained
  botnet dataset), and the authors were successful in detecting this activity with
  an accuracy of 99.2 %.

ABS: In the internet, BGP is de-facto inter-domain routing protocol. It is unprotected
  against number of attacks such as prefix hijacking and traffic interference. There
  have been many incidents of prefix hijacking on internet. To protect BGP against
  these kinds of attacks several mechanisms exist but they are not implemented fully
  because it requires cooperation among tens of thousands of independent ASes. This
  paper proposes two mechanisms which will show that safety can be achieved by implementing
  these mechanisms on small group of ASes.

ABS: Drive-by downloads are the preferred distribution vector for many malware families.
  In the drive-by ecosystem many exploit servers run the same exploit kit and it is
  a challenge understanding whether the exploit server is part of a larger operation.
  In this paper we propose a technique to identify exploit servers managed by the
  same organization. We collect over time how exploit servers are configured and what
  malware they distribute, grouping servers with similar configurations into operations.
  Our operational analysis reveals that although individual exploit servers have a
  median lifetime of 16 hours, long-lived operations exist that operate for several
  months. To sustain long-lived operations miscreants are turning to the cloud, with
  60% of the exploit servers hosted by specialized cloud hosting services. We also
  observe operations that distribute multiple malware families and that pay-per-install
  affiliate programs are managing exploit servers for their affiliates to convert
  traffic into installations. To understand how difficult is to take down exploit
  servers, we analyze the abuse reporting process and issue abuse reports for 19 long-lived
  servers. We describe the interaction with ISPs and hosting providers and monitor
  the result of the report. We find that 61% of the reports are not even acknowledged.
  On average an exploit server still lives for 4.3 days after a report.

ABS: We study the CXPST attack which aims at the destruction of interdomain routing
  system and propose a spreading model to represent the threatening scale. By analyzing
  the process we illuminate the mechanism of how CXPST seizes the BGP deficiencies
  to paralyze the Internet control plane from the traffic attack of data plane, and
  then the spreading model named as EDM-CS is presented based by the epidemic dynamics
  theory. Parameters of the model are closely associated with the real network topology
  and BGP router overloading condition which reflect the features of the CXPST spreading.
  In virtue of the classical BA scale-free network, spreading density that derives
  from EDM-CS behaves great consistency with the simulation results based on the collected
  data from CAIDA. This model can help understanding CXPST attack and providing a
  basis for predicting the spreading trend, as well as investigating effective defense
  strategy.

ABS: The Internet is designed to bypass failures by rerouting around connectivity
  outages. Consequently, dynamical redistribution of loads may result in congestion
  in other networks. Due to the co-location of data plane and control plane traffic
  of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the survivability of inter-domain routing system
  is sensitive to severe congestion. Therefore, an initial outage may lead to a cascade
  of failures in the Internet. In this paper, we characterize the survivability of
  inter-domain routing system by reachability and number of rerouting messages, and
  propose a model for studying the relationship between the survivability and the
  capacity of AS links under intentional attacks and random breakdowns. Through simulations
  on an empirical topology of the Internet, we find that the cascading failures bring
  a great deal of added burden to almost all the core ASes. When the tolerance parameter
  of AS links is less than 0.1, the cascading effect tends to be amplified globally.
  Moreover, the effect triggered by intentional attack is greater than that triggered
  by random breakdown. But the difference between them is not as prominent as previous
  research due to the unique automatic-restoration process in inter-domain routing
  system.

TOPKEY: topology-ark-itdk
GEOLOC: Beijing, CN
ABS: Blocking attack flows to protect the threatened resources is a necessary step
  in defending against the Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. Two kinds
  of reactive packet filtering technologies have been proposed as close to victim-end
  filtering and close to source-ends filtering. The first scheme only involves a single
  Active Filtering Routers (AFRs) but damages the whole network bandwidth resource;
  another extreme scheme requires millions of AFRs and thus degrades the network transmission
  performance, but it has the best defense effect. A feasible scheme should use a
  certain quantity of AFRs to filter attack flows between the victim end and the source
  ends. Going one step further, in this paper, we make the first effort on studying
  the filtering location to maximize the protected network bandwidth while not permitting
  any attack flow to reach the victim. We formulate this problem to an integer linear
  programming problem and design an efficient heuristic filtering location algorithm.
  We evaluate our algorithm through integrating it into the existing filtering architecture
  and implementing this integration scheme on the emulated DDoS scenarios based on
  real-world Internet topology. Our evaluation results show that compared to the state-of-the-art
  source-ends filtering scheme (Active Internet Traffic Filtering), this integration
  scheme only uses 20% of its AFRs to achieve more than 70% of its protection effect.

GEOLOC: Stony Brook, NY, US
ABS: In this paper, we study multicast scheduling in all-optical packet switches.
  We first propose a novel optical buffer called multicast-enabled Fiber-Delay-Lines
  (M-FDLs), which can provide flexible delay for copies of multicast packets using
  only a small number of FDL segments. We then present a Delay-Guaranteed Multicast
  Scheduling (DGMS) algorithm that considers the schedule of each arriving packet
  for multiple time slots. We show that DGMS has several desirable features, such
  as guaranteed delay upper bound and adaptivity to transmission requirements. To
  relax the time constraint of DGMS, we further propose a parallel and pipeline architecture
  for DGMS that distributes the scheduling task to multiple pipelined processing stages,
  with N processors in each stage, where N is the switch size. Finally, by using a
  simple combination logic circuit, we show that each processor can finish the scheduling
  for one time slot in O(1) time. The performance of DGMS is tested extensively against
  statistical traffic models and real Internet traffic, and the results show that
  the proposed DGMS algorithm can achieve ultra-low average packet delay with minimum
  packet drop ratio.

ABS: Reliability is a major concern for memories. To ensure that errors do not affect
  the data stored in a memory, error correction codes (ECCs) are widely used in memories.
  ECCs introduce an overhead as some bits are added to each word to detect and correct
  errors. This increases the cost of the memory. Content addressable memories (CAMs)
  are a special type of memories in which the input is compared with the data stored,
  and if a match is found, the output is the address of that word. CAMs are used in
  many computing and networking applications. In this brief, the specific features
  of CAMs are used to reduce the cost of implementing ECCs. More precisely, the proposed
  technique eliminates the need to store the ECC bits for each word in the memory.
  This is done by embedding those bits into the address of the key. The main potential
  issue of the new scheme is that it restricts the addresses in which a new key can
  be stored. Therefore, it can occur that a new key cannot be added into the CAM when
  there are addresses that are not used. This issue is analyzed and evaluated showing
  that, for large CAMs, it would only occur when the CAM occupancy is close to 100%.
  Therefore, the proposed scheme can be used to effectively reduce the cost of implementing
  ECCs in CAMs.

ABS: Firewalls are ubiquitous security functions and exist in almost all network connected
  devices whether protecting host stacks or providing transient packet filtering.
  Firewall performance, which is a key ingredient for network performance, can be
  greatly degraded by traffic crafted to exploit its filtering algorithms. These attacks
  can greatly reduce the Quality of Service (QoS) received by existing authorized
  flows in the firewall. This paper proposes a novel architecture that decouples this
  linkage between authorized flow QoS and adversarial traffic, marginalizing disruption
  caused by unauthorized flows, and ultimately improving overall performance of software
  defined firewalls. We show substantial improvements in throughput, packet loss,
  and latency over baseline software defined firewalls with varying ratios of attack
  traffic. All results are obtained using the cycle accurate architecture simulator
  gem5, and Internet packet traces obtained from 10 Gbps interfaces of core Internet
  routers.

ABS: In the present Internet, inter-domain routing is based on BGP-4 which does not
  allow for the use of multiple paths, but rather selects a single path per destination
  prefix. However, as the global Internet connectivity graph displays vast inherent
  path diversity, we believe that there is a lack of mechanisms which put this latent
  potential into use. To this end, we propose Inter-Domain Route Diversity (IDRD)
  as a mechanism which allows for diverse inter-domain paths to be propagated among
  carriers and used for packet forwarding. Our proposal is aimed to be efficient,
  backwards compatible, and incrementally deployable. In order to make use of the
  existing path diversity, we also propose a relaxation of the multipath route selection
  policy that is provably stable, while being more flexible. Our extensive evaluation
  of path disjointness in the Internet connectivity graph illustrates the potential
  benefits of IDRD. While the evaluation shows that the traditional prefer customer
  rule heavily impedes the use and propagation of the underlying diversity, it also
  demonstrates that our proposed relaxation of the multipath route selection policy
  enables near-optimal utilization of the underlying path diversity in the real Internet
  inter-domain topology.

ABS: Internet congestion existing solutions such as active queue management algorithms

  highly affected by the environment and the parameters that are used. In this paper
  we are proposing a mechanism that is capable of detecting congestions by monitoring
  passively an aggregation link. The proposed mechanism does not need parameterizations
  since all the used parameters are deduced from public real internet traces using
  statistical approaches and uses TCP delays as a detection parameter. It is dynamic
  since the detection is proportional to the severity of the congestion. Experimental
  results have shown that the proposed mechanism is able to detect congestion rapidly
  and does not suffer from false alarms.

ABS: A future content-centric Internet would likely consist of autonomous systems

  networks, each of them optimized for local performance. To understand the influence
  of interactions between autonomous cache networks, in this paper we consider ASes
  that maintain peering agreements with each other for mutual benefit, and engage
  in content-level peering to leverage each others cache contents. We propose a model
  of the interaction and the coordination between the caches managed by peering ASes.
  We address whether stable and efficient content-level peering can be implemented
  without explicit coordination between the neighboring ASes in order for the system
  to be stable. We show that content-level peering leads to stable cache configurations,
  and that avoiding simultaneous updates by peering ISPs provides faster and more
  cost efficient convergence to a stable configuration. We validate our analytical
  results using simulations on the measured peering topology of more than 600 ASes.

ABS: It has been demonstrated that traffic analysis can disclose information supposedly

  purpose are packet lengths, inter-packet times, direction of packets. This work
  aims at assessing the overhead and delay implied by traffic masking algorithms that
  conceal the information leakage exploited by statistical traffic analysis. Traffic
  masking is obtained by reshaping packet lengths and inter-arrival times in a masking
  device. It is shown that the overhead-delay trade-off of the masking device is optimized
  by using circuit like traffic shaping, under the constraint of removing information
  leakage entirely (full privacy). Numerical examples are provided with real traffic
  traces both for full privacy and for a relaxed heuristic masking algorithm that
  leaks some information on packet lengths to mitigate the overhead.

  is potentially transformative for cybersecurity, but issues of scale and data complexity
  pose challenges for current technology. In this paper, we outline requirements and
  opportunities for graph-structured IPFLOW analytics based on our experience with

ABS: 'Operating networks is hard. When a network goes down, network administrators
  have only a rudimentary set of tools at their disposal to track down the root cause
  of the outage. As networks have become more complicated, with more network protocols
  modifying the forwarding behavior below, and more application types running above,
  the debugging toolkit has remained essentially unchanged, with little or no innovation
  in years. Today, skilled network administrators frequently use manual, heuristic-
  driven procedures to configure and maintain networks. Humans are involved almost
  every time something goes wrong, and we are still far from an era of automated troubleshooting.
  In this dissertation, I show how packet histories--the full story of every packets
  journey through the network--can simplify network diagnosis. A packet history is
  the route a packet takes through a network, combined with the switch state and header
  modifications it encounters at each switch on the route. Using packet history as
  the core construct, I propose an abstraction for systematic network troubleshooting,
  a framework with which to express the observed error symptoms and pose questions
  to the network. To demonstrate the usefulness of packet histories and the practical
  feasibility of constructing them, I built NetSight, an extensible platform that
  captures packet histories and enables applications to concisely and flexibly retrieve
  packet histories of interest. Atop NetSight I built four applications that illustrate
  its flexibility: an interactive network debugger, a live invariant monitor, a path-aware
  history logger, and a hierarchical network profiler. On a single modern multi-core
  server, NetSight can process packet histories for the traffic of multiple 10 Gb/s
  links. For larger networks, NetSight scales linearly with additional servers. To
  scale it even further to bandwidth-heavy enterprises and datacenter networks, I
  present two optimized NetSight variants using straightforward additions to switch
  ASICs and hypervisor-based switches.'

ABS: Internet is an ever-growing network. The network equipment has to be improved
  to cope with this growth, including those devices used to classify the network traffic.
  Internet service providers and network operators require to apply different QoS
  policies for specific protocols. Then, such classifying systems are critical. However,
  classification by port does not provide good results, and it is necessary to apply
  other more complex techniques. These classification techniques have to be fast enough
  to work at line rates. This paper presents a system that unifies the entire process
  involved in flow classification at high speed. It captures the traffic, builds flows
  from the received packets and finally classifies them inside a GPU. All the process
  is possible at 10 Gbps using commodity hardware. Our results show that the achieved
  performance is very influenced by the number of protocols to find, and it is limited
  by the number of network flows. In any case, our system reaches up to 24.4 Gbps

ABS: Link provisioning is used in backbone links to ensure that quality of service
  goals are met. This relies on accurate estimations of the required capacity for
  a link. Current approached lack this accuracy which may result in problems of over-
  and underdimensioning of links. Alternative approaches, as found in the literature,
  often require network traffic measurements at the packet level. These measurements
  are most of the time costly and not scalable at high-speed networks. Therefore,
  a new method for doing link dimensioning is proposed. This method relies on traffic
  measurements at the flow-level and the results are promising. This research further
  investigates this method by assessing the impact of flow timeouts on the accuracy
  of the bandwidth provisioning formula. Our results show that the smaller the timeouts,
  the higher the costs for doing bandwidth dimensioning. On the other hand do smaller
  timeouts not automatically result in more accurate results.

ABS: We propose STRIDE, a new DDoS-resilient Internet architecture that isolates attack
  traffic through viable bandwidth allocation, preventing a botnet from crowding out
  legitimate flows. This new architecture presents several novel concepts including
  tree-based bandwidth allocation and long-term static paths with guaranteed bandwidth.
  In concert, these mechanisms provide domain-based bandwidth guarantees within a
  trust domain -- administrative domains grouped within a legal jurisdiction with
  enforceable accountability; each administrative domain in the trust domain can then
  internally split such guarantees among its endhosts to provide (1) connection establishment
  with high probability, and (2) precise bandwidth guarantees for established flows,
  regardless of the size or distribution of the botnet outside the source and the
  destination domains. Moreover, STRIDE maintains no per-flow state on backbone routers
  and requires no key establishment across administrative domains. We demonstrate
  that STRIDE achieves these DDoS defense properties through formal analysis and simulation.
  We also show that STRIDE mitigates emerging DDoS threats such as Denial-of-Capability
  (DoC) [6] and N 2 attacks [22] based on these properties that none of the existing
  DDoS defense mechanisms can achieve.

ABS: Autonomous Systems(ASes) discover routing paths to the destination AS via BGP
  announcements advertised by neighbor ASes in interdomain routing. However, the actual

  paths. Lying about data routing path is the main cause of path inconsistency. Prior
  work on this issue could not stop ASes announcing non-best routing path. This paper
  search for constraint conditions on routing policy to make the single AS have no
  incentive to unilaterally lie about its actual routing path, if the other ASes in
  the network honestly advertise their actual routing paths. We model routing policy
  with AS business relationships and propose AS revenue function to quantify AS incentive.
  Relying on traffic attraction models, we propose the constraint conditions. We demonstrate,

GEOLOC: Pullman, WA, US
ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose one of the most serious security
  threats to the Internet. In this work, we aimed to develop a collaborative defense
  framework against DDoS attacks in networks. We focus on two main phases, which are
  anomaly detection and filtering of malicious traffic, to achieve a successful defense
  against DDoS attacks. Our first accomplishment is to effectively detect DDoS traffic
  at local nodes. Our conducted experiments can be divided into three categories which
  are described as follows. Firstly, in order to detect the stealthy DDoS attack at
  an early stage, we proposed an effective detection scheme based on time-series decomposition
  method. Moreover, in order to more effectively defend against the attacks, our credit-based
  defense method is designed for pinpointing the malicious flows. In addition, in
  order to adapt to the high-speed environment, we present a two-level approach for
  scalable and accurate attack detection by exploiting the asymmetry in the attack
  traffic. At both detection levels, sketch structures are utilized to ensure the
  scalability of our scheme. Secondly, current defense systems are not scalable well
  to high-speed networks and few of them are able to defend against attacks originated
  from both spoofed and genuine source addresses effectively. Aimed at this problem,
  we propose a two-stage defense scheme to mitigate attacks. The main advantage of
  our defense approach is its space efficiency since it does not need to keep per-flow
  state. Moreover, both spoofed and genuine IP DDoS attacks can be well regulated.
  We finally extend the single-host sketch-based scheme to a distributed detection
  scheme and finally develop a collaborative defense scheme. In the distributed detection
  scheme, we deploy detectors in a certain number of edge routers at the edge side.
  The local analyzer periodically reports the local processed result to the global
  analyzer in order to infer the anomaly. The collaborative defense scheme is further
  developed to filter the malicious traffic. By combing both the host-based solutions
  with the network-wide solutions, we develop a comprehensive solution that can detect
  and defend against attacks more effectively. Experimental results using the real
  Internet traffic demonstrate its effectiveness.

ABS: The Internet has been evolving into a more heterogeneous internetwork with diverse
  new applications imposing more stringent bandwidth and QoS requirements. Already
  new applications such as YouTube, Hulu, and Netflix are consuming a large fraction
  of the total bandwidth. We argue that, in order to engineer future internets such
  that they can adequately cater to their increasingly diverse and complex set of
  applications while using resources efficiently, it is critical to be able to characterize
  the load that emerging and future applications place on the underlying network.
  In this article, we investigate entropy as a metric for characterizing per-flow
  network traffic complexity. While previous work has analyzed aggregated network
  traffic, we focus on studying isolated traffic flows. Per-application flow characterization
  caters to the need of network control functions such as traffic scheduling and admission
  control at the edges of the network. Such control functions necessitate differentiating
  network traffic on a per-application basis. The entropy fingerprints that we get
  from our entropy estimator summarize many characteristics of each applications network
  traffic. Not only can we compare applications on the basis of peak entropy, but
  we can also categorize them based on a number of other properties of the fingerprints.

ABS: A flow cache is a fundamental building block for flow-based traffic processing.
  Its efficiency is critical for the overall performance of a number of networked
  devices and systems. The efficiency is mainly dependent on a utilized replacement
  policy. This work proposes an approach based on Genetic Algorithm. The proposed
  approach starts from recorded traffic traces and uses Genetic Algorithm to evolve
  innovative replacement policies tailored for the flow cache management in particular
  deployments. An extension of the replacement policy is proposed to improve the already
  optimized policy even further. The extension is based on an evolution of a replacement
  policy and a classifier of packet-header fields. The results show a consistent decrease
  in an eviction ratio in case of two considered problems -- reduction of overall
  number of evictions and reduction of eviction in case of heavy-hitting flows.

  large-scale network simulation and high-fidelity network emulation, and thereby
  enables real instances of network applications and protocols to run in real operating
  environments, and be tested under large-scale simulated network settings. In our
  approach, network simulation and emulation form a symbiotic relationship, through
  which they are synchronized for an accurate representation of the large-scale traffic
  behavior. We introduce a model downscaling method, along with an efficient queuing
  model  and a traffic reproduction technique, which can significantly reduce the
  synchronization overhead and improve computational efficiency, while maintaining
  the accuracy of the sys-  tem. We validate our approach with extensive experiments  via
  simulation and with a real-system prototype.

  scheme are highlighted. This evaluation is based on CAIDA Internet traces October
  2012 dataset. The results show that using DFM may reduce as many as 90% of marked
  packets on average required for tracing attacks with no false positives, while it
  eliminates the spoofed marking embedded by the attacker as well as compromised routers
  in the attack path. Moreover, unlike DPM that traces the attack up to the ingress
  interface of the edge router close to the attacker, DFM allows the victim to trace
  the origin of incorrect or spoofed source addresses up to the attacker node, even
  if the attack has been originated from a network behind a network address translation
  (NAT), firewall, or a proxy server.

ABS: 'In many networks with distributed operation and self-organization features,
  acquiring their global topological information is impractical, if feasible at all.
  Internet protocols drawing on node centrality indices may instead approximate them
  with their egocentric counterparts, computed out over the nodes ego-networks. Surprisingly,
  however, in router-level topologies the approximative power of localized ego-centered
  measurements has not been systematically evaluated. More importantly, it is unclear
  how to practically interpret any positive correlation found between the two centrality
  metric variants. The paper addresses both issues using different datasets of ISP
  network topologies. We first assess how well the egocentric metrics approximate
  the original sociocentric ones, determined under perfect network-wide information.
  To this end we use two measures: their rank-correlation and the overlap in the top-k
  node lists the two centrality metrics induce. Overall, the rank-correlation is high,
  in the order of 0.8-0.9, and, intuitively, becomes higher as we relax the ego-network
  definition to include the egos r-hop neighborhood. On the other hand, the top-k
  node overlap is low, suggesting that the high rank-correlation is mainly due to
  nodes of lower rank. We then let the node centrality metrics drive elementary network
  operations, such as local search strategies. Our results suggest that, even under
  high rank-correlation, the locally-determined metrics can hardly be effective aliases
  for the global ones. The implication for protocol designers is that rank-correlation
  is a poor indicator for the approximability of centrality metrics.'

ABS: The assumption of Gaussian traffic is widely used in network modeling and planning.
  Due to its importance, researchers have repeatedly studied the Gaussian character
  of traffic aggregates. However, dedicated studies on this subject date back to 2002
  and 2006. It is well known that network traffic has changed in the past few years
  due the the increasing use of social networks, clouds and video streaming websites.
  Therefore, the goal of this paper is to verify whether the Gaussianity assumption
  still holds for current network traffic. To this end, we study the characteristics
  of a large dataset, consisting of traces from four continents. The employed analysis
  methodology is similar to that found in previous works. In addition to the analysis
  of recent measurements, we also perform tests for a very long measurement period
  of six years. Our results show that the evolution of network traffic has not had
  a significant impact on its Gaussian character. Our findings also indicate that
  it is safer to relate the degree of Gaussianity to traffic bandwidth than to the
  number of users for high-speed links.

  comparisons, because they treat each level independently. We propose a new approach
  called rtd that eliminates the redundancy, therefore improves the analysis efficiency,
  by integrating all levels recursively. Our extensive evaluations on simulated traces

  85% comparisons on average and doubles the analysis speed. Finally, we design a

ABS: A future content-centric Internet would likely consist of autonomous systems
  (ASes) just like todays Internet. It would thus be a network of interacting cache
  networks, each of them optimized for local performance. To understand the influence
  of interactions between autonomous cache networks, in this paper we consider ASes
  that maintain peering agreements with each other for mutual benefit, and engage
  in content-level peering to leverage each others cache contents. We propose a model
  of the interaction and the coordination between the caches managed by peering ASes.
  We address whether stable and efficient content-level peering can be implemented
  without explicit coordination between the neighboring ASes or alternatively, whether
  the interaction needs to rely on explicit announcements of content reachability
  in order for the system to be stable. We show that content-level peering leads to
  stable cache configurations, both with and without coordination. If the ASes do
  coordinate, then coordination that avoids simultaneous updates by peering ISPs provides
  faster and more cost efficient convergence to a stable configuration. Furthermore,
  if the content popularity estimates are inaccurate, content-level peering is likely
  to lead to cost efficient cache allocations. We validate our analytical results
  using simulations on the measured peering topology of more than 600 ASes.

ABS: 'The eigenvalues of matrices representing the structure of large-scale complex
  networks present a wide range of applications, from the analysis of dynamical processes

  structure of a network and its eigenvalues is to use synthetic random networks in
  which structural properties of interest, such as degree distributions, are prescribed.
  Although very common, synthetic models present two major flaws: 1) These models
  are only suitable to study a very limited range of structural properties; and 2)
  they implicitly induce structural properties that are not directly controlled and
  can deceivingly influence the network eigenvalue spectrum. In this paper, we propose
  an alternative approach to overcome these limitations. Our approach is not based
  on synthetic models. Instead, we use algebraic graph theory and convex optimization
  to study how structural properties influence the spectrum of eigenvalues of the
  network. Using our approach, we can compute, with low computational overhead, global
  spectral properties of a network from its local structural properties. We illustrate
  our approach by studying how structural properties of online social networks influence

ABS: The Internet is a complex network, comprised of thousands of interconnected Autonomous
  Systems. Considerable research is done in order to infer the undisclosed commercial
  relationships between ASes. These relationships, which have been commonly classified
  to four distinct Type of Relationships (ToRs), dictate the routing policies between
  ASes. These policies are a crucial part in understanding the Internets traffic and
  behavior patterns. This work leverages Internet Point of Presence (PoP) level maps
  to improve AS ToR inference. We propose a method which uses PoP level maps to find
  complex AS relationships and detect anomalies on the AS relationship level. We present
  experimental results of using the method on ToR reported by CAIDA and report several
  types of anomalies and errors. The results demonstrate the benefits of using PoP
  level maps for ToR inference, requiring considerable less resources than other methods
  theoretically capable of detecting similar phenomena.

ABS: We show that fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 traffic is vulnerable to effective interception
  and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by an off -path attacker. Specifically, we demonstrate
  a weak attacker intercepting more than 80% of the data between peers and causing
  over 94% loss rate. We show that our attacks are practical through experimental
  validation on popular industrial and open-source products, with realistic network
  setups that involve NAT or tunneling and include concurrent le- gitimate traffic
  as well as packet losses. The interception attack requires a zombie agent behind
  the same NAT or tunnel-gateway as the victim destination; the DoS attack only requires
  a puppet agent, that is, a sandboxed applet or script running in web-browser context.
  The complexity of our attacks depends on the predictability of the IP Identification
  (ID) field which is typically implemented as one or multiple counters, as allowed
  and recommended by the IP specifications. The attacks are much simpler and more
  efficient for implementations, such as Windows, which use one ID counter for all
  destinations. Therefore, much of our focus is on presenting effective attacks for
  implementations, such as Linux, which use per-destination ID counters. We present
  practical defenses for the attacks presented in this article, the defenses can be
  deployed on network firewalls without changes to hosts or operating system kernel.

GEOLOC: Waterloo, CA
ABS: Inspired by the challenges of designing a robust, and undetectable covert channel,
  in this paper we introduce a design methodology for timing covert channels that
  achieve provable polynomial-time undetectability. This means that the covert channel
  can not be detected by any polynomial-time statistical test that analyzes the samples
  of the covert traffic and the legitimate traffic. The proposed framework is based
  on modeling the covert channel as a differential communication channel, and the
  formulation for modulation/demodulation processes that are derived according to
  the communication model. The proposed scheme incorporates a trellis structure in
  modulating the covert message. The trellis structure is also used at the covert
  receiver to perform iterative demodulation/decoding of the covert message that significantly
  enhances the channel reliability. In addition, the paper presents an adaptive modulation
  strategy that improves the channel robustness without compromising the stealthiness
  of the channel. The combination of the adaptive modulation and the trellis structure
  gives the covert channel considerable flexibility and low error rate at the covert
  receiver. In fact, performance analysis of the channel reveals that the proposed
  covert communication scheme withstands extremely high levels of network noise and
  adversarial disruption, while it maintains an outstanding undetectability level
  and covert rate.

ABS: 'Cyber-attacks are happening every day, with a variety of behaviors and objects.
  For example, email spammers may compromise computers to sign-up millions of email
  accounts for sending spam emails; during worm spreading, each infected host may
  try to connect to many hosts to further spread the worm, etc. However, many such
  large-scale and often distributed cyber-attacks share a common characteristic that
  the activities involved in them result in changes in the cardinality of attack traffic.
  Examples include: the cardinality of the accounts signed up by a compromised host
  often increases in spam email delivery scenarios, and the cardinality of the connections
  made from a host may increase in worm spreading scenarios. In this paper, we focus
  on changes in the cardinality of the network/attack traffic that may indicate on-going
  cyber-attacks. We formulate this problem as cardinality-based change point detection
  in distributed streams of attack traffic, and develop a nonparametric error-bounded
  scheme for it. Our scheme supports the capability of merging information collected
  from multiple monitoring points to detect large-scale attacks. Also, our scheme
  uses small space as well as constant processing time, which makes it applicable
  for spaceconstrained network or security systems. We have conducted experiments
  using both real-world traces and synthetic data. Experimental results and theoretical
  analysis show that our scheme can detect changes in the cardinality within given
  time and error bounds. We expect the solutions of this work will be deployed as
  a building block in network and security monitoring systems to detect large distributed

ABS: 'Most network management tasks in software-defined networks (SDN) involve two
  stages: measurement and control. While many efforts have been focused on net-work
  control APIs for SDN, little attention goes into measurement. The key challenge

  speed and low cost). We propose a software defined traffic measurement architecture
  OpenSketch, which separates the measurement data plane from the control plane. In
  the data plane, OpenSketch provides a simple three-stage pipeline (hashing, filtering,
  and counting), which can be implemented with commodity switch components and support
  many measurement tasks. In the control plane, OpenSketch provides a measurement
  library that automatically configures the pipeline and allocates resources for different
  measurement tasks. Our evaluations of real-world packet traces, our prototype on
  NetFPGA, and the implementation of six measurement tasks on top of OpenSketch, demonstrate
  that OpenSketchis general, efficient and easily programmable.'

ABS: Bloom filter based forwarding was proposed recently in several protocol alternatives
  to IP multicast. Even though some of these protocols avoid the state in intermediate
  routers, they still have scalability limitations and require explicit network management
  as well as non-trivial functionality from the network components. In this work we
  propose an architecture based on in-packet Bloom filter forwarding, in which the
  burden of scalability management is left to the multicast source and end-hosts.
  We present several algorithms to improve the scalability of multicast transmission
  and evaluate them in a real Internet topology. Our evaluation confirms the ability
  of the proposed stateless design to save up to 70% of traffic volume in the large
  scale topology for big groups of subscribers, and up to 30% for small groups.

ABS: An effective Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) defense mechanism must guarantee
  legitimate users access to an Internet service masking the effects of possible attacks.
  That is, it must be able to detect threats and discard malicious packets in a online
  fashion. Given that emerging data streaming technology can enable such mitigation
  in an effective manner, in this paper we present STONE, a stream-based DDoS defense
  framework, which integrates anomaly-based DDoS detection and mitigation with scalable
  data streaming technology. With STONE, the traffic of potential targets is analyzed
  via continuous data streaming queries maintaining information used for both attack
  detection and mitigation. STONE provides minimal degradation of legitimate users
  traffic during DDoS attacks and it also faces effectively flash crowds. Our preliminary
  evaluation based on an implemented prototype and conducted with real legitimate
  and malicious traffic traces shows that STONE is able to provide fast detection
  and precise mitigation of DDoS attacks leveraging scalable data streaming technology.

  is a prerequisite to prevent such abuse; thus, this is fundamentally important for
  both theoretical researches and practical applications. Existing researches mainly
  focus on the confirmation of anonymous communication relationship and cannot be
  used to identify and block anonymous communication traffic. To solve this problem,
  the operation mechanism is deeply analyzed and traffic characteristics are summarized
  for the widely used Tor anonymous communication system. On this basis, a TLS fingerprint-based
  and packet-size distributions based methods are proposed to identify Tor anonymous
  communication traffic, respectively. The advantages, disadvantages and applicability
  of these two methods are analyzed and discussed in detail, and are validated by
  CAIDA dataset and online deployment. Experimental results prove that both methods
  are effective in identifying Tor anonymous communication traffic.

ABS: Time-Decaying Bloom Filters are efficient, probabilistic data structures used
  to answer queries on recently inserted items. As new items are inserted, memory
  of older items decays. Incorrect query responses incur penalties borne by the application
  using the filter. Most existing filters may only be tuned to static penalties, and
  they ignore Bayesian priors and information latent in the filter. We address these
  issues in an integrated way by converting existing filters into inferential filters.
  Inferential filters combine latent filter information with Bayesian priors to make
  query-specific optimal decisions. Our methods are applicable to any Bloom Filter,
  but we focus on developing inferential time-decaying filters, which support new
  query types and sliding window queries with varying error penalties. We develop
  the inferential version of the existing Timing Bloom Filter. Through experiments
  on real and synthetic datasets, we show that when penalties are query-specific and
  prior probabilities are known, the inferential Timing Bloom Filter reduces penalties
  for incorrect responses to sliding-window queries by up to 70%.

ABS: Estimating per-flow performance characteristics such as latency, loss, and jitter

  problems affecting end-to-end flows. However, doing this accurately in real-time

  infeasible on nodes that process large volumes of traffic. In this paper, we propose
  an approximate and scalable method to estimate TCP flow latency in the network.
  Our method scales with the number of flows by keeping approximate TCP state in a
  compressed, probabilistic data structure that requires less memory and compute,
  but sacrifices a small amount of accuracy. We validate our method using backbone
  link traces and compare it against an exact, baseline approach. In our approximate
  method, 99% of the reported latencies are within 10.3 ms of the baseline reported
  value, while taking an order of magnitude less memory.

ABS: Multipath interdomain routing has been proposed to enable flexible traffic engineering
  for transit Autonomos Systems (ASes). Yet, there is a lack of solutions providing
  maximal path diversity and backwards compatibility at the same time. The BGP-XM
  (Border Gateway Protocol-eXtended Multipath) extension presented in this paper is
  a complete and flexible approach to solve many of the limitations of previous BGP
  multipath solutions. ASes can benefit from multipath capabilities starting with
  a single upgraded router, and without any coordination with other ASes. BGP-XM defines
  an algorithm to merge into regular BGP updates information from paths which may
  even traverse different ASes. This algorithm can be combined with different multipath
  selection algorithms, such as the K-BESTRO (K-Best Route Optimizer) tunable selection
  algorithm proposed in this paper. A stability analysis and stable policy guidelines
  are provided. The performance evaluation of BGP-XM, running over an Internet-like
  topology, shows that high path diversity can be achieved even for limited deployments
  of the multipath mechanism. Further results for large-scale deployments reveal that
  the extension is suitable for large deployment since it shows a low impact in the
  AS path length and in the routing table size.

ABS: Based on CAIDAs (cooperative association for Internet data analysis )statistics
  at AS-level collected from April 2009 to April 2010, it is found that network size,
  degree correlations and clustering have changed significantly three times. According
  to the definition of k-core, the Internet topology is divided into different levels.
  In this paper, by analyzing the changing connection on each level at the three time
  spots, we found that the connection difference between the highest and the lowest
  level varies cyclically. Before Internet has significant change, the connection
  difference between the highest and the lowest shell changes acutely. At that time
  point it is the later stage of the fluctuation period which is the accumulation
  of small fluctuation. The concept of catastrophe coefficient is proposed for quantifying
  the probability of Internet catastrophe so that the catastrophe coefficient of Internet
  could be calculated on real time, and the catastrophe time spots could be predicted.
  Using real data for verification, it turns out that catastrophe coefficient can
  accurately predict the giant fluctuations occurrence in the macroscopic structure.
  With the proposal of the concept of catastrophe coefficient, the research can play
  an important guiding role in understanding the actual network internal development
  and changes, analyzing the cause of Internet catastrophe, preventing devastating

ABS: IP prefix hijacking remains a serious security threat to the traditional services
  in the Internet. It also harms the confidentiality and integrity of user data in
  Internet-enabled cloud services because of its great dependence on Internet routing
  infrastructure. In addition, collaborations between networks in the cloud environment,
  especially in cross-domain deployment, bring about new types of prefix hijacking
  attack, which may cause greater impact due to side-effect of the cooperation of
  victim and infected autonomous systems. It is important to understand what impact
  a prefix hijacking attack can cause and how the number and locations of participants
  can affect the attacking results. In this paper, we model this problem as an attack
  planning task and solve it by applying a genetic algorithm. By analyzing the best
  solution to the problem, we find that the type of victims plays a more important
  role in IP prefix hijacking than that of attackers. Attackers can gain great impact
  even when the prefixes of a small number of victims are hijacked. For attack planning,
  the degree of an autonomous system is a major criterion to be considered. These
  findings are useful for securing cloud computing networks by preventing and eliminating
  IP prefix hijacking attacks

ABS: Overlay routing is an application-level routing mechanism on overlay networks.
  Previous researches have revealed that the overlay routing can improve user-perceived
  performance. However, it may also generate traffic unintended by ISPs, incurring
  additional monetary cost. In addition, since ISPs and end users have their own objectives
  respectively regarding traffic routing, overlay routing must be operated considering
  both standpoints. In the present paper, we propose a method to reduce inter-ISP
  transit costs caused by overlay routing from the both standpoints of ISPs and end
  users. To determine the relationships among ASes, which are required for ISP cost-aware
  routing, we construct a method to estimate a transit cost of overlay-routed paths
  from end-to-end network performance values. Utilizing the metric, we propose a novel
  method that controls overlay routing from the both standpoints of ISPs and end users.
  Through extensive evaluations using measurement results from the actual network
  environments, we confirm that the advantage of the proposed method whereby we can
  reduce the transit cost in the overlay routing and can control the overlay routing
  according to the objectives of both ISPs and end users.

ABS: While Tor is the most popular low-latency anonymity network in use today, Tor
  suffers from a variety of performance problems that continue to inhibit its wide
  scale adoption. One reason why Tor is slow is due to the manner in which clients
  select Tor relays. There have been a number of recent proposals for modifying Tors
  relay selection algorithm, often to achieve improved bandwidth, latency, and/or
  anonymity. This paper explores the anonymity and performance trade-offs of the proposed
  relay selection techniques using highly accurate topological models that capture
  the actual Tor networks autonomous system (AS) boundaries, points-of-presence, inter-relay
  latencies, and relay performance characteristics. Using realistic network models,
  we conduct a whole-network evaluation with varying traffic workloads to understand
  the potential performance benefits of a comprehensive set of relay selection proposals
  from the Tor literature. We also quantify the anonymity properties of each approach
  using our network model in combination with simulations fueled by data from the
  live Tor network.

ABS: In the last years we assisted to a large increase of the number of applications
  running on top of IP networks. Consequently the need to implement very efficient
  monitoring solutions that can manage these high data rates and that can classify
  the type of traffic which is traveling over the network has increased. For example,
  as far as network security is concerned, in the recent years we have seen a shift
  from so-called network-level attacks, which target the network they are transported
  on (e.g. Denial of Service), to content-based threats which exploit applications
  vulnerabilities and require sophisticated levels of intelligence to be detected.
  For some of these threats, it is no more sufficient to have only a software solution
  on the client side but we also need to run some controls on the network itself.
  To manage these kinds of scenarios, payload inspection is often required in order
  to correctly identify the application protocol and to process the data carried over
  it. This is the reason why, in recent years, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology
  has emerged. This kind of processing is in many cases implemented, at least in part,
  through dedicated hardware. However, full software solutions may often be more appealing
  because they are typically more economical and have, in general, the capability
  to react faster to protocols evolution and changes. Moreover, software solutions
  which run over general purpose hardware do not exploit the underlying multiprocessor
  architecture, providing only the capability to process the incoming packets sequentially.
  Furthermore, many DPI research works that can be found in literature and which exploits
  multicore architectures are often characterized by a poor scalability, due to the
  overhead required for synchronization and to load unbalance among the used cores.
  In this thesis, we will describe the design and implementation of a DPI framework
  capable of managing current networks rates using commodity multicore hardware. Our
  framework provides the possibility to identify the protocol, to specify the kind
  of data to extract when it has been identified and how these data has to be processed.
  Differently from existing works, the developed framework has been designed according
  to the structured parallel programming theory, allowing thus to completely hide
  to the user the complexity of the management of the problems related to an efficient
  exploitation of the underlying architecture. These concepts have then been applied
  using FastFlow, a library for structured parallel programming targeting both shared
  memory and distributed memory architectures.

ABS: A DDoS attack is the most prevalent threat, viz., flooding the computing and
  communication resources in order to make the service unavailable for legitimate
  users, since a decade and continues to be threatening till date. Therefore, these
  critical resources must be protected against the DDoS attacks. The detection of
  DDoS attacks requires adaptive and incremental learning classifier, less computational
  complexity, and accurate decision making from uncertain information. Hence, the
  DDoS attacks could be detected using existing soft computing techniques such as
  fuzzy logic, neural networks, and genetic algorithms. Fuzzy logic has the advantage
  of interpreting the rules well but it suffers from the disadvantage of not able
  to acquire the rules automatically. The neural networks generalize the network well
  but they cannot interpret the rules. Genetic algorithm provides optimal solutions
  but the time complexity is high. Hybrid methods, Neuro-fuzzy and genetic fuzzy have
  been proposed to overcome the drawbacks of interpretability and manual rules acquisition.
  In this paper, adaptive and hybrid neuro-fuzzy systems were proposed as subsystems
  of the ensemble. Sugeno type Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) has been
  chosen as a base classifier for our research as Mamdani type ANFIS is not suitable
  for real time due to its high computational complexity and non-adaptiveness to extract
  exact knowledge from the dataset. Single classifier makes error on different training
  samples. So, by creating an ensemble of classifiers and combining their outputs,
  the total error can be reduced and the detection accuracy can be increased. Improvement
  in the performance of ANFIS ensemble is the focus of this paper. Our proposed DDoS
  classification algorithm, NFBoost, differs from the existing methods in weight update
  distribution strategy, error cost minimization, and ensemble output combination
  method, but resembles similar in classifier weight assignment and error computation.
  Our proposed NFBoost algorithm is achieved by combining ensemble of classifier outputs
  and Neyman Pearson cost minimization strategy, for final classification decision.
  Publicly available datasets such as KDD Cup, CAIDA DDOS Attack 2007, CONFICKER worm,
  UNINA traffic traces, and UCI Datasets were used for the simulation experiments.
  NFBoost was trained and tested with the publicly available datasets and our own
  SSE Lab SSENET 2011 datasets. Detection accuracy and Cost per sample were the two
  metrics used to analyze the performance of the NFBoost classification algorithm
  and were compared with bagging, boosting, and AdaBoost algorithms. From the simulation
  results, it is evident that NFBoost algorithm achieves high detection accuracy (99.2%)
  with fewer false alarms. Cost per instance is also very less for the NFBoost algorithm
  compared to the existing algorithms. NFBoost algorithm outperforms the existing
  ensemble algorithms with a maximum gain of 8.4% and a minimum gain of 1.1%.

ABS: Compact routing intends to achieve a good tradeoff between routing path length
  and storage overhead, and is recently considered as a main alternative to overcome
  the fundamental scaling limitations of the Internet routing system. It is generally
  believed that specialized compact routing schemes for peculiar network topologies
  have better average performance than universal ones, and name-independent schemes
  are more flexible due to their natural support of the Locator/ID split principle.
  In this paper, we propose the highest degree landmark based routing scheme (HDLBR),
  which is the first specialized name-independent compact routing scheme for Internet-like
  power-law networks. HDLBR optimizes routing performance by selecting a few nodes
  with high degrees as the landmarks and making these nodes to be the entrances for
  mapping topologically agnostic node names to topology-aware node addresses. Simulation
  results show that HDLBR has very small average routing table size, in the order
  of O(n^1/2) bits per node on both synthesized power-law graphs and the real AS graphs.
  Meanwhile, the average stretch of the HDLBR scheme is comparable with the base Abraham
  scheme using random coloring, and is only slightly outperformed by the customized
  Abraham scheme which also takes into account the degree heterogeneity of power-law
  networks.

ABS: The cost of a single zero-day network worm outbreak has been estimated at US
  $2.6 billion. Additionally zero-day worm outbreaks have been observed to spread
  at a significant pace across the global Internet, with an observed infection proportion
  of more than 90 percent of vulnerable hosts within 10 minutes. The threat posed
  by such fast-spreading malware is therefore significant, particularly given the
  fact that network operator / administrator intervention is not likely to take effect
  within the typical epidemiological timescale of such infections. An accepted tool
  that is used in researching the threat presented by zero-day worms is the use of
  simulation systems. However when considering zero-day worm outbreaks on the Internet
  there are persistent issues of scale and fidelity. The Internet Worm Simulator (IWS)
  reported in this paper is designed to address these issues by presenting a novel
  simulation method that, on a single workstation, can simulate an entire IPv4 address
  space on a node-by-node basis. Being able to simulate such a large-scale network
  enables the further analysis of characteristics identified from worm analysis. As
  IWS does not rely on mathematical approximation, the epidemiological attributes
  identified from real-world data can be tested for zero-day worm outbreaks on the
  Internet. Experimentation indicates that IWS is able to accurately simulate and
  corroborate with reported characteristics of two previous zero-day worm outbreaks.
  It is intended that, in future, IWS may be used to aid both in the analysis of previous
  worm outbreaks and the testing of hypothetical zero-day worm outbreak scenarios.

ABS: 'Exploiting Internet path diversity to enhance communication reliability and

  and give a formal model of strategy-labeled inter-domain paths. Then we develop
  three associated algorithms: Topology extraction (TE), Multi-path computation algorithm
  (MCA) and Classification of path pattern (CPP), which are used to compute and classify
  inter-domain paths. Experimental results show two useful and important observations
  that valley paths have averagely more than 73% in all inter-domain paths, and Class
  1 paths account for 64.6% of all valley paths. The observations may guide the design
  of inter-domain routing protocol, especially the design of multi-path routing, to

GEOLOC: Eugene, OR, US
ABS: During the past decade, the Internet has witnessed a dramatic increase in the
  popularity of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications. This has caused a significant growth
  in the volume of P2P traffic. This trend has been particularly alarming for the
  Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that need to cope with the associated cost but
  have limited control in routing or managing P2P traffic. To alleviate this problem,
  researchers have proposed mechanisms to reduce the volume of external P2P traffic
  for individual ISPs. However, prior studies have not examined the global effect
  of P2P applications on the entire network, namely the traffic that a P2P application
  imposes on individual underlying Autonomous Systems (ASs). Such a global view is
  particularly important because of the large number of geographically scattered peers
  in P2P applications. This dissertation examines the global effect of P2P applications
  on the underlying AS-level Internet. Toward this end, first we leverage a large
  number of complete overlay snapshots from a large-scale P2P application, namely
  Gnutella, to characterize the connectivity and evolution of its overlay structure.
  We also conduct a case study on the performance of BitTorrent and its correlation
  with peer- and group-level properties. Second, we present and evaluate Respondent-driven
  sampling as a promising technique to collect unbiased samples for characterizing
  peer properties in large-scale P2P overlays without requiring the overlays complete
  snapshot. Third, we propose a new technique leveraging the geographical location
  of peers in an AS to determine its geographical footprint and identify the cities
  where its Points-of-Presence (PoPs) are likely to be located. Fourth, we present
  a new methodology to characterize the effect of a given P2P overlay on the underlying
  ASs. Our approach relies on the large scale simulation of BGP routing over the AS-level
  snapshots of the Internet to identify the imposed load on each transit AS. Using
  our methodology, we characterize the impact of Gnutella overlay on the AS-level
  underlay over a 4-year period. Our investigation provides valuable insights on the
  global impact of large scale P2P overlay on individual ASs. This dissertation includes
  my previously published and co-authored material.

ABS: Hash-based load-balancing techniques are widely used to distribute the load over
  multiple forwarding paths and preserve the packet sequence of transport-level flows.
  Forcing a long-lived, i.e., elephant, flow to follow a specific path in the network
  is a desired mechanism in data center networks to avoid crossing hot spots. This
  limits the formation of bottlenecks and so improves the network use. Unfortunately,
  current per-flow load-balancing methods do not allow sources to deterministically
  force a specific path for a flow. In this paper, we propose a deterministic approach
  enabling end hosts to steer their flows over any desired load-balanced path without
  relying on any packet header extension. By using an invertible mechanism instead
  of solely relying on a hash function in routers, our method allows to easily select
  the packets header field values in order to force the selection of a given load-balanced
  path without storing any state in routers. We perform various simulations and experiments
  to evaluate the performance and prove the feasibility of our method using a Linux
  kernel implementation. Furthermore, we demonstrate with simulations and lab experiments
  how MultiPath TCP can benefit from the combination of our solution with a flow scheduling
  system that efficiently distributes elephant flows in large data center networks.

ABS: Data stream management systems (DSMS) aim to process massive data streams in

  However, DSMS can be overloaded due to large bursts in data stream arrivals and

  scheme by applying distributed fuzzy logic control, which is very effective to deal
  with uncertainties in highly dynamic systems such as DSMS, based on the per-stream
  backlog and selectivity of each query operator. We have implemented our approach
  by extending an open source distributed DSMS. The performance evaluation using high-rate
  Internet traces shows that our approach closely supports a specified backlog bound
  for each data stream queue, while improving the query processing delay, with little
  overhead.

ABS: The creation of a routing overlay network on the Internet requires the identification
  of shorter detour paths between end hosts in comparison to the default path available.
  These detour paths are typically the edges forming a Triangle Inequality Violation
  (TIV), an artifact of the Internet delay space where the sum of latencies across
  an intermediate hop is lesser than the direct latency between the pair of end hosts.
  These violations are caused mainly due to interdomain routing policies between Autonomous
  Systems (ASes) and AS peering through Internet eXchange Points (IXPs). Identifying
  detours for a global overlay network requires large amounts of computational capabilities
  due to the sheer number of possible paths linking source and destination ASes. In
  this work, we use parallel programming paradigms to exploit the massively parallel
  capabilities of analyzing the large network measurement datasets made available
  to the network research community by CAIDA. We study Internet routes traversing
  IXPs and measure potential TIVs created by these paths. Large scale analysis of
  the dataset is carried out by implementing an efficient parallel solution on the
  CPU and then the general purpose graphics processor unit (GPGPU) as well. Both multicore
  CPU and GPGPU implementations can be carried out with ease on desktop environments
  with readily available software. We find both parallel solutions yield high improvements
  in speedup (2-35x) in comparison to the serial methodologies thereby opening up
  the possibility of harnessing the power of parallel programming with readily available
  hardware. The large amount of data analyzed and studied helps draw various inferences
  for the networking research community in building future scalable Internet routing
  overlays with greater routing efficiencies.

ABS: Due to unpredictable peer churns (joins, leaves and failures), it is challenging
  to offer video continuity in peer-to-peer (P2P) live streaming. In this paper, we
  study a push-based P2P network formed by unreliable nodes (i.e., nodes which may
  churn at any time). To achieve high stream continuity, the video is encoded into
  k MDC (Multiple-Description Coded) streams and t FEC (Forward Error Correction)
  streams. To achieve low delay and reduce error correlation between streams, the
  k+t streams are pushed to the nodes in parent-disjoint spanning trees. The issue
  is how to construct these trees minimizing the worst-case node delay. We address
  the optimization of the spanning trees through problem analysis and algorithmic
  design. After presenting a model capturing important system parameters and delay
  components, we formulate the problem and prove that it is NP-hard. We then propose
  SUN (Streaming with Unreliable Nodes), a simple, adaptive and distributed algorithm
  which continuously reduces delay through overlay adaptation. Through extensive simulation
  on real Internet and Internet-like topologies, we show that stream continuity can
  be achieved with push-based P2P streaming. SUN is effective, achieving low delay
  and high continuity in the presence of node churns for P2P live streaming

ABS: 'Internet delivery infrastructures are traditionally optimized for low-latency
  traffic, such as the Web traffic. However, in recent years we are witnessing a massive
  growth of throughput-oriented applications, such as video streaming. These applications
  introduce new tradeoffs and design choices for content delivery networks (CDNs).
  In this paper, we focus on understanding two key design choices: (1) What is the
  impact of the number of CDNs peering points and server locations on its aggregate
  throughput and operating costs? (2) How much can ISP-CDNs benefit from using path
  selection to maximize its aggregate throughput compared to other CDNs who only have
  control at the edge? Answering these questions is challenging because content distribution
  involves a complex ecosystem consisting of many parties (clients, CDNs, ISPs) and
  depends on various settings which differ across places and over time. We introduce
  a simple model to illustrate and quantify the essential trade-offs in CDN designs.
  Using extensive analysis over a variety of network topologies (with varying numbers
  of CDN peering points and server locations), operating cost models, and client video
  streaming traces, we observe that: (1) Doubling the number of peering points roughly
  doubles the aggregate throughput over a wide range of values and network topologies.
  In contrast, optimal path selection improves the CDN aggregate throughput by less
  than 70%, and in many cases by as little as a few percents. (2) Keeping the number
  of peering points constant, but reducing the number of location (data centers) at
  which the CDN is deployed can significantly reduce operating costs.'

ABS: Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a novel paradigm for future Internet
  architectures. It exploits the current trend in Internet usage which mostly involves
  information dissemination. ICN architectures based on the publish/subscribe model
  use names for information in order to route requests and data, as well as to facilitate
  in-network caching, anycasting and multicasting for efficient content delivery.
  However, the number of named information objects is expected to be huge in the future
  Internet, raising serious concerns with respect to a global-scale deployment of
  ICN. Routing and forwarding will require vast amounts of state, which pushes storage,
  maintenance and processing demands to the limit. In this paper we discuss the feasibility
  of deploying the Data Oriented Networking Architecture (DONA) by leveraging cloud
  computing facilities. We identify the exact scalability concerns for DONA based
  on simulations over a realistic model of the current Internet topology and find
  that registrations for information objects lead to a state explosion. For this reason,
  we then discuss how cloud facilities can assist DONA deployment, focusing on various
  options for deploying DONA in the cloud and their suitability for different areas
  of the inter-network.

ABS: Middleboxes, such as caches, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems, form
  a vital part of network infrastructure today. Administrators deploy middleboxes
  in diverse scenarios from enterprise networks, to datacenters, to access networks.
  However, middleboxes are universally deployed under what we call the unilateral
  model, where middleboxes are deployed and configured by administrators alone, for
  the benefit of hosts in a single domain alone. In this thesis, we present two new
  deployment models for middleboxes which offer new capabilities for middlebox usage
  as well as new business models for middlebox deployment. Netcalls is an extension
  to the Internet architecture that allows end host applications to invoke and configure
  middleboxes in any network their traffic traverses; for example, we present a web
  server that invokes inter-domain DDoS defense when it detects that it is under attack.
  APLOMB is a system that allows enterprise networks (as well as individual end hosts)
  to tunnel their traffic to and from a cloud service that applies middlebox processing
  to their traffic, avoiding the costly and management-intensive burden of administering
  middleboxes in a local network. Netcalls and APLOMB allow ISPs and cloud providers
  (respectively) to monetize their deployment of middleboxes by offering them as a
  service to third-party clients; all the while presenting new capabilities, in the
  case of netcalls by enabling application interaction and in the case of APLOMB by
  providing better scalability and easier management. We discuss both of these proposals
  and their benefits in detail; we then discuss challenges and opportunities towards
  their deployment and adoption.

ABS: Many attacks on the Internet spoof the source IP addresses. Numerous techniques
  have been researched and developed thus far to cope with this, but they are not
  yet sufficient. This paper proposes a Domain Name System-based technique for handling
  the issue. An attacker needs the IP address of an application server, the target
  of attack, to access there. To obtain the address, the attacker queries the DNS
  full-service resolver to resolve the servers fully qualified domain name. While
  the attacker is inquiring about the address, it cannot spoof its address in the
  proposed scheme. The proposed scheme informs the application server-side gateway
  of the clients address, with which the gateway can ignore access by those other
  than the informed address.

ABS: 'The IEEE 802.3az standard provides a mechanism to build energy efficient Ethernet
  interfaces via a low power idle mode that they can enter when there is no data to

  to minimize energy consumption with little disruption to the traffic. Two algorithms
  stand out among those because of their simplicity and performance: frame transmission
  and burst transmission. Although these algorithms have been shown to be very efficient
  in simulated scenarios, there is a lack of general analytical models for their behavior.
  In fact, to this date, the only analyzed traffic patterns have been variants of
  Poisson traffic. In this paper we provide a general GI/G/1 model for energy consumption
  and traffic delay for both algorithms. We then develop specializations of the general
  model for Poisson and deterministic traffic. Finally, we validate the model with
  the help of both synthetic traffic and real Internet traffic traces.'

ABS: The problem of finding and updating shortest paths in distributed networks is
  considered crucial in todays practical applications. In the recent past, there has
  been a renewed interest in devising new efficient distance-vector algorithms as
  an attractive alternative to link-state solutions for large-scale Ethernet networks,
  in which scalability and reliability are key issues or the nodes can have limited
  storage capabilities. In this paper we present Distributed Computation Pruning (DCP),
  a new technique, which can be combined with every distance-vector routing algorithm
  based on shortest paths, allowing to reduce the total number of messages sent by
  that algorithm and its space occupancy per node. To check its effectiveness, we
  combined DCP with DUAL (Diffuse Update ALgorithm), one of the most popular distance-vector
  algorithm in the literature, which is part of CISCOs widely used EIGRP protocol,
  and with the recently introduced LFR (Loop Free Routing) which has been shown to
  have good performances on real networks. We give experimental evidence that these
  combinations lead to a significant gain both in terms of number of messages sent
  and memory requirements per node.

  that, like splay trees, moves more frequently accessed nodes closer to the root.
  After m operations on n items, c of which access some item v, an operation on v
  traverses a path of length O(log m/c) while performing few if any rotations. In
  contrast to the traditional self-adjusting splay tree in which each accessed item
  is moved to the root through a sequence of tree rotations, the CBTree performs rotations
  infrequently (an amortized subconstant o(1) per operation if m >> n), mostly at
  the bottom of the tree. As a result, the CBTree scales with the amount of concurrency.
  We adapt the CBTree to a multicore setting and show experimentally that it improves
  performance compared to existing concurrent search trees on non-uniform access sequences
  derived from real workloads.

  Such schemes have some drawbacks to incur modification of routing table or severe

  performance without additional burden to lookup scheme. In the proposed scheme a
  non-leaf prefix is expanded to the length of the longest immediate descendant prefix
  when it is cached. Evaluation result shows our scheme achieves very low miss ratio
  even though it does not increase the size of routing table and cache miss penalty.

ABS: The single-chip crosspoint-queued (CQ) switch is a self-sufficient switching
  architecture enabled by state-of-art ASIC technology. Unlike the legacy input-queued
  or output-queued switches, this kind of switch has all its buffers placed at the
  crosspoints of input and output lines. Scheduling is also performed inside the switching
  core, and does not rely on instantaneous communications with input or output line-cards.
  Compared with other legacy switching architectures, the CQ switch has the advantages
  of high throughput, minimal delay, low scheduling complexity, and no speedup requirement.
  However, since the crosspoint buffers are small and segregated, packets may be dropped
  as soon as one of them becomes full. Thus how to efficiently use the crosspoint
  buffers and decrease the packet drop rate remains a major problem that needs to
  be addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel chained structure for the CQ switch,
  which supports load balancing and deflection routing. We also design scheduling
  algorithms to maintain the correct packet order caused by multi-path switching.
  All these techniques require modest hardware modifications and memory speedup in
  the switching core, but can greatly boost the overall buffer utlization and reduce
  the packet drop rate, especially for large switches with small crosspoint buffers
  under bursty and non-uniform traffic.

ABS: Multicore communications processors have become the main computing element in
  Internet routers and mobile base stations due to their flexibility and high processing
  capability. These processors are designed and equipped with enough resources to
  handle peak traffic loads. But network traffic varies significantly over time and
  peak traffic is observed very rarely. This variation in amount of traffic gives
  us an opportunity to save power during the low traffic times. Existing power management
  schemes are either too conservative or are unaware of traffic demands. We present
  a predictive power management scheme for communications or network processors. We
  use a traffic and load predictor to pro-actively change the number of active cores.
  Predictive power management provides more power efficiency than reactive schemes
  because it reduces the lag between load changes and changes in power adaptations
  since adaptations can be applied before the load changes. The proposed scheme also
  uses Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to change the frequency of the
  active cores to adapt to variation in traffic during the prediction interval. We
  perform experiments on real network traces and show that the proposed traffic aware
  scheme can save up to 40% more power in communications processors as compared to
  traditional power management schemes.

ABS: As hardware support for improved endhost security becomes ubiquitous, it is important
  to consider how network security and performance can benefit from these improvements.
  If portions of each endhost can be trusted, then network infrastructure no longer
  needs to arduously and imprecisely reconstruct data already known by the endhosts.
  Through the design of a general-purpose architecture we call Assayer, we explore
  issues in providing trusted host-based data, including the balance between useful
  data and user privacy, and the tradeoffs between security and efficiency. We also
  evaluate the usefulness of such information in several case studies. We implement
  and evaluate a basic Assayer prototype. Our prototype requires fewer than 1,000
  lines of code on the endhost. Endhosts can annotate their outbound traffic in a
  few microseconds, and these annotations can be checked efficiently; even packet-level
  annotations on a gigabit link can be checked with a loss in throughput of only 13.1%.

ABS: Decoy Routing is a new approach to Internet censorship circumvention that was
  recently and independently proposed at FOCI11, USENIX Security11 and CCS11. Decoy
  routing aims to hamper nation-state level Internet censorship by having routers,
  rather than end hosts, relay traffic to blocked destinations. We analyze the security
  of these schemes against a routing capable adversary, a censoring authority that
  is willing to make routing decisions in response to decoy routing systems. We explore
  China, Syria, Iran, and Egypt as routing capable adversaries, and evaluate several
  attacks that defeat the security goals of existing decoy routing proposals. In particular,
  we show that a routing capable adversary can enumerate the participating routers
  implementing these protocols; can successfully avoid sending traffic along routes
  containing these routers with little or no adverse effects; can identify users of
  these schemes through active and passive attacks; and in some cases can probabilistically
  identify connections to targeted destinations.

ABS: Simultaneous attacks can cause devastating damage, breaking down communication
  networks into small fragments. To mitigate the risk and develop proactive responses,
  it is essential to assess the robustness of network in the worst-case scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose a spectral lower-bound on the number of removed links
  to incur a certain level of disruption in terms of pairwise connectivity. Our lower-bound
  explores the latent structural information in the network Laplacian spectrum, the
  set of eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix, to provide guarantees on the robustness
  of the network against intentional attacks. Such guarantees often cannot be found
  in heuristic methods for identifying critical infrastructures. For the first time,
  the attack- resistant proofs of large scale communication networks against link
  attacks are presented.

ABS: The Internet ecosystem comprising of thousands of Autonomous Systems (ASes) now
  include Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) as another critical component in the infrastructure.
  With the growth of peering worldwide, IXPs are playing an increasing role not only
  in the topology evolution of the Internet but also inter-domain path routing. In
  this work, we first motivate the need to monitor popular exchange points based on
  geographical locations. These major IXPs are responsible for transmitting 43% of
  the total IXP traffic and hence play a significant role in determining the effects
  of peering at IXPs on path latencies. Using the most important route performance
  metric of end to end latency we then propose and implement a measurement framework
  to carry out an in-depth comparison of paths traversing an IXP with other available
  alternate paths. We observe the presence of a significant percentage of alternate
  paths outperforming the default route through an IXP in all major regions. Even
  though IXPs are set up primarily with economic benefits in mind, we conclude that
  there is a huge potential for improvement with more efficient routing and better
  planning at the primary IXPs around the world.

ABS: The growth of peering at Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) by Autonomous Systems
  (ASes) has led to opportunities for the creation of newer architectures for improved
  inter-domain routing. This peering infrastructure is now a critical component of
  the Internet ecosystem and may be exploited to identify global routes with lower
  end to end latencies. In this work we propose a measurement framework to infer triangle
  inequality violations (TIVs) in the Internet delay space which are created due to
  worldwide peering. We then study and analyze properties of this artifact of Internet
  routing policies and motivate the potential for the creation of future overlay networks
  based on these TIVs. We observe popular peering links provide alternate paths between
  a set of end hosts which are more efficient and are thus responsible for their creation.
  By carrying out a graph based study of the underlying topology of TIVs, we provide
  a theoretical basis of indicating the common subset of good peering links decreasing
  overall end to end delays. We observe the presence of a significant percentage of
  alternate paths outperforming the default route through an IXP in all major regions.
  Even though IXPs are set up primarily with economic benefits in mind, we conclude
  that there is a huge potential for improvement with more efficient routing and better

ABS: A promising way to capture the characteristics of changing traffic is to extract
  significant flow clusters in traffic. However, clustering flows by 5-tuple requires
  flow matching in huge flow attribute spaces, and thus, is difficult to perform on
  the fly. We propose an efficient yet flexible flow aggregation technique for monitoring
  the dynamics of network traffic. Our scheme employs two-stage flow-aggregation.
  The primary aggregation stage is for efficiently processing a huge volume of raw
  traffic records. It first aggregates each attribute of 5-tuple separately, and then,
  produces multi-dimensional flows by matching each attribute of a flow to the resulted
  aggregated attributes. The secondary aggregation stage is for providing flexible
  views to operators. It performs multi-dimensional aggregation with the R-tree algorithm
  to produce concise summaries for operators. We report our prototype implementation

ABS: Information diffusion is a fundamental process taking place in networks. It is
  often possible to observe when nodes get influenced, but it is hard to directly
  observe the underlying network. Furthermore, in many applications, the underlying
  networks are implicit or even unknown. Existing works on network inference can only
  infer influential edges between two nodes. In this paper, we develop a method for
  inferring top-k maximal influential paths which can capture the dynamics of information
  diffusion better compared to influential edges. We define a generative influence
  propagation model based on the Independent Cascade Model and Linear Threshold Model,
  which mathematically model the spread of certain information through a network.
  We formalize the top-k maximal influential path inference problem and develop an
  efficient algorithm, called TIP, to infer the top-k maximal influential paths. TIP
  makes use of the properties of top-k maximal influential paths to dynamically increase
  the support and prune the projected databases. We evaluate the proposed algorithms
  on both synthetic and real world data sets. The experimental results demonstrate
  the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

ABS: This thesis analyzes the threat of autonomous system (AS) and Internet exchange
  (IX) level adversaries on Tor, currently the most widely deployed and used anonymity
  overlay network. Of particular interest is the possibility of a single AS or IX
  point observing both the path from the client to the entry node and the path from
  the exit node to the final destination. Experimental results indicate that a non-trivial
  number of circuits are vulnerable to such compromise. A novel AS-level path prediction
  algorithm is developed in order to allow the client to choose paths without vulnerabilities.
  The path prediction algorithm sacrifices some accuracy in the top path prediction
  in order to decrease the hardware requirements necessary to predict AS-level paths
  and is simple enough to run on standard client hardware. We validate the accuracy
  of the path predictor first compared to classical path prediction algorithms, then
  compared to traceroute data taken from Planet Lab. The simulator predicts paths
  with similar sets of ASes and links finding 90% of the actual ASes seen in the traceroute
  data. The effects of choosing paths utilizing the new path predictions is then investigated
  to find that load balancing is adversely affected. The entropy loss due to the new
  path selection method is also investigated, specifically the entropy of the client
  from an adversary observing the exit/destination path. We find that choosing paths
  with our new path selection algorithm results in minimal entropy loss. Overall,
  the results demonstrate that the new path simulator is a lightweight solution to
  defend against AS and IX-level compromise of anonymous communication paths on the
  Internet and should be considered for deployment to maintain the privacy guarantees
  of such systems.

ABS: Let G be a connected graph, and let d(a,b) denotes the shortest path distance
  between vertices a and b of G. The graph G is delta-hyperbolic if for any vertices
  a,b,c,d of G, the two largest of the three sums S1 = d(a,b) + d(c,d), S2 = d(a,c)
  + d(b,d), and S3 = d(a,d) + d(b,c) differ by at most 2 delta. This can be determined
  in time O(n^4) which could be prohibitive for large graphs. In this document, we
  propose an exact algorithm for determining the hyperbolicity of a graph that is
  scalable for large graphs. The time complexity of this algorithm is a function of
  the size of the largest bi-connected component of the graph, of the shortest path
  distance distribution in this componenant and of the value of the hyperbolicity.
  In the worst case, the time complexity remains in O(n^4), but it is much faster
  in practice. We also propose both a multiplicative factor and an additive constant
  approximation algorithms. We then analyze further the time complexity of our exact
  algorithm for several class of graphs, and present some computational results on
  large-scale graphs.

TOPKEY: topology-skitter-aslinks
ABS: We study how the behavior of viral spreading processes is influenced by local
  structural properties of the network over which they propagate. For a wide variety
  of spreading processes, the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the network
  plays a key role on their global dynamical behavior. For many real-world large-scale
  networks, it is unfeasible to exactly retrieve the complete network structure to
  compute its largest eigenvalue. Instead, one usually have access to myopic, egocentric
  views of the network structure, also called egonets. In this paper, we propose a
  mathematical framework, based on algebraic graph theory and convex optimization,
  to study how local structural properties of the network constrain the interval of
  possible values in which the largest eigenvalue must lie. Based on this framework,
  we present a computationally efficient approach to find this interval from a collection
  of egonets. Our numerical simulations show that, for several social and communication
  networks, local structural properties of the network strongly constrain the location
  of the largest eigenvalue and the resulting spreading dynamics. From a practical
  point of view, our results can be used to dictate immunization strategies to tame
  the spreading of a virus, or to design network topologies that facilitate the spreading
  of information virally.

ABS: BitTorrent-based peer-to-peer networks constitute a significant share of Internet
  traffic. Therefore, the IETF working group on application layer traffic optimization
  (ALTO) discusses several approaches for guiding the BitTorrent traffic that aim
  at reducing the large amount of inter-ISP traffic costs caused by these networks.
  However, performance evaluations of these approaches are mostly limited to artificial
  scenarios that do not take into account the real Internet topology with its inter-ISP
  relationships and the actual distribution of BitTorrent users across autonomous
  systems (AS). In this study, we use measurements of the distribution of a large
  number of live BitTorrent networks and combine them with the AS-level Internet topology
  provided by Caida.org. Based on this data, we estimate in which tier of the Internet
  hierarchy BitTorrent traffic is mainly located and how much optimization potential
  exists for the different types of ISPs. Therewith, traffic flow and revenue implications
  of guiding Internet-wide BitTorrent swarms are analyzed. Our results show that tier-1
  ISPs profit from the un-managed exchange of peer-to-peer traffic and that these
  profits significantly decrease when the other ISPs would apply ALTO solutions.

ABS: Understanding of the Internet evolution is important for many research topics,

  analyze CAIDA AS-level topology dataset from 2004 to 2010 to validate two conjectures
  on the Internet evolution, i.e., the Internet flattening trend and the preferential
  attachment rule. Our analysis shows that the evolvement of the Internet core is
  different from the edge of Internet. We classify the Internet into several layers
  using different layering methods, i.e., Rich Club coefficient based method, k-core
  decomposition method and SARK hierarchy model, and then study the changes of the
  features of these layers. Under all of these laying methods, we find that the boundaries
  between neighboring layers in the Internet core are more and more blurred; ASes
  in the core distribute more evenly and different layers are closer to each other
  in size, while the Internet edge still has a distinct hierarchical characteristic.
  It is more evident in Asia and Europe than North America. The other difference between
  Internet core and Internet edge is that link births/deaths in the Internet core
  follow the Preferential Attachment/de-attachment rule, while link births/deaths
  in the Internet edge follow a super linear preferential attachment/de-attachement
  rule. On the other hand, in both Internet core and Internet edge, link births caused
  by AS births present stronger preference than link rewiring.

ABS: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in multi/many core processors
  as a target architecture for high performance software router. This is a clear difference
  from the previous trend to use dedicated network processors and hardware components.
  Because of its key position in routers, hardware IP lookup implementation has been
  intensively studied with TCAM and FPGA based architecture. However, increasing interest
  in software implementation has also been observed. In this paper, we evaluate the
  performance of software only IP lookup on a many core chip, the TILEPro64 processor.
  For this purpose we have implemented two widely used IP lookup algorithms, DIR-24-8-BASIC
  and Tree Bitmap. We evaluate the performance of these two algorithms over the TILEPro64
  processor with both synthetic and real-world traces. After a detailed analysis,
  we propose a hybrid scheme which provides high lookup speed and low worst case update
  overhead. Our work shows how to exploit the architectural features of TILEPro64
  to improve the performance, including many optimization in both single-core and
  parallelism aspects. Experiment results show by using only 18 cores, we can achieve
  a lookup throughput of 60Mpps (almost 40Gbps) with low power consumption, which
  demonstrates great performance potentials in many core processors.

ABS: Traffic classification on high-speed, multi-Gb/s links has up to now been demonstrated

  the complexity of the involved networking system ends up consuming almost all computational

  modified to compute novel metrics. These counters do not need to be on the ASIC.
  If the ASIC data plane has a fast connection to a general-purpose CPU with cost-effective
  memory, we can replace traditional counters with a stream of rule-match records,
  transmit this stream to the CPU, and then process the stream in the CPU. These software-defined
  counters allow far more flexible processing of counter-related information, and
  can reduce the ASIC area and complexity needed to support counters.

ABS: The largest IXPs carry on a daily basis traffic volumes in the petabyte range,
  similar to what some of the largest global ISPs reportedly handle. This little-known
  fact is due to a few hundreds of member ASes exchanging traffic with one another
  over the IXPs infrastructure. This paper reports on a first-of-its-kind and in-depth
  analysis of one of the largest IXPs worldwide based on nine months worth of sFlow
  records collected at that IXP in 2011. A main finding of our study is that the number
  of actual peering links at this single IXP exceeds the number of total AS links
  of the peer-peer type in the entire Internet known as of 2010! To explain such a
  surprisingly rich peering fabric, we examine in detail this IXPs ecosystem and highlight
  the diversity of networks that are members at this IXP and connect there with other
  member ASes for reasons that are similarly diverse, but can be partially inferred
  from their business types and observed traffic patterns. In the process, we investigate
  this IXPs traffic matrix and illustrate what its temporal and structural properties
  can tell us about the member ASes that generated the traffic in the first place.
  While our results suggest that these large IXPs can be viewed as a microcosm of
  the Internet ecosystem itself, they also argue for a re-assessment of the mental
  picture that our community has about this ecosystem.

ABS: Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a new paradigm in which the network layer
  provides users with content, instead of providing communication channels between
  hosts, and is aware of the name (or identifiers) of the contents. A fundamental
  ICN operation is the routing of content requests towards a node that is able to
  provide the requested content. To meet this goal, different routing architectures
  have been proposed so far. In this paper, we consider a network that uses arouting-by-name
  architecture, i.e. content requests are routed on the base of the content name by
  using a name-based routing table. We focus on the scenario of fetching Web contents,
  assuming to use ICN in place of traditional TCP/IP means. In this scenario we need
  to handle tens of billions of name-based routes, due to the high numbers of Web
  contents and to the limited aggregability of their names. Consequently, re-using
  the existing architecture of an IP router would result in two severe problems. First,
  the current Forwarding Information Base (FIB) technology is unable to contain all
  name-based routes. Second, implementing a so large Routing Information Base (RIB)
  requires a very costly hardware. In order to overcome these problems, we propose
  a routing-by-name architecture, named Lookup-and-Cache, where the FIB is used as
  a cache of routes, while the RIB is stored in a remote and centralized routing engine.
  By analyzing real Internet traces, we prove the effectiveness of the proposed architecture,
  which we also show to be feasible with current technology. In fact, our ICN nodes
  require to have only a limited set of routes in their FIB, even when supporting
  a high number of traffic flows. We have implemented our proposed Lookup-and-Cache
  solution within the CCNx software framework and we used this implementation to assess
  system performance, such as download delay, lookup rate and fairness. The paper
  is completed with a discussion on how ICN can be used not only to fetch Web contents
  but also for other scenarios.

ABS: A network flow watermarking scheme attempts to manipulate the statistical properties
  of a flow of packets to insert a mark making it easier to detect the flow after
  passing through one or more relay hosts. Because an attacker that is willing to
  tolerate delay can (nearly) always eliminate such marks, recent schemes have concentrated
  on making the marks invisible so that a passive attacker cannot detect the presence
  of the mark. In this work, we argue that from a systems perspective, security against
  passive detection is insufficient for successful traffic analysis. We introduce
  a stronger, but feasible attack model (a known/chosen flow attacker) and a second
  security goal (security against copy attacks) and argue that security against both
  of these attacks is required for successful traffic analysis. We also demonstrate
  successful attacks against two recent watermarking schemes, RAINBOW and SWIRL, and
  show how considering these stronger attacks can aid in the design of passive detection
  attacks against each as well.

ABS: Todays Internet is prominently used for content distribution. Various platforms
  such as content delivery networks (CDNs) have become an integral part of the digital
  content ecosystem. Most recently, the information-centric networking (ICN) paradigm
  proposes the adoption of native content naming for secure and efficient content
  delivery. This further enhances the flexibility of content access where a content
  request can be served by any source within the Internet. In this paper, we propose
  and evaluate a multi-criteria decision algorithm for efficient content delivery
  applicable for content networks in general (among others, CDN and ICN). Our algorithm
  computes the best available source and path for serving content requests taking
  into account information about content transfer requirements, location of the consumer,
  location of available content servers, content server load and content delivery
  paths between content servers and consumer. The proposed algorithm exploits two
  closely related processes. The first level discovers multiple content delivery paths
  and gathers their respective transfer characteristics. This discovery process is
  based on long-term network measurements and performed offline. The second process
  is invoked for each content request to find the best combined content server and
  delivery path. The cooperation between both levels allows our algorithm to increase
  the number of satisfied content requests thanks to efficient utilisation of network
  and server resources. The proposed decision algorithm was evaluated by simulation
  using Internet scale network model. The results confirm the effectiveness gain of
  content network architectures that introduce network awareness. Moreover, the simulation
  process allows for a comparison between different routing algorithms and, especially,
  between single and multipath routing algorithms.

ABS: Understanding network structure and having access to realistic graphs plays a
  central role in computer and social networks research. In this paper, we propose
  a complete, and practical methodology for generating graphs that resemble a real
  graph of interest. The metrics of the original topology we target to match are the
  joint degree distribution (JDD) and the degree-dependent average clustering coefficient
  (c(k)). We start by developing efficient estimators for these two metrics based
  on a node sample collected via either independence sampling or random walks. Then,
  we process the output of the estimators to ensure that the target properties are
  realizable. Finally, we propose an efficient algorithm for generating topologies
  that have the exact target JDD and a c(k) close to the target. Extensive simulations
  using real-life graphs show that the graphs generated by our methodology are similar
  to the original graph with respect to, not only the two target metrics, but also
  a wide range of other topological metrics; furthermore, our generator is order of
  magnitudes faster than state-of-the-art techniques.

ABS: A content-centric network is one which supports host-to-content routing, rather
  than the host-to-host routing of the existing Internet. This paper investigates
  the potential of caching data at the router-level in content-centric networks. To
  achieve this, two measurement sets are combined to gain an understanding of the
  potential caching benefits of deploying content-centric protocols over the current
  Internet topology. The first set of measurements is a study of the BitTorrent network,
  which provides detailed traces of content request patterns. This is then combined
  with CAIDAs ITDK Internet traces to replay the content requests over a real-world
  topology. Using this data, simulations are performed to measure how effective content-centric
  networking would have been if it were available to these consumers/providers. We
  find that larger cache sizes (10,000 packets) can create significant reductions
  in packet path lengths. On average, 2.02 hops are saved through caching (a 20% reduction),
  whilst also allowing 11% of data requests to be maintained within the requesters
  AS. Importantly, we also show that these benefits extend significantly beyond that
  of edge caching by allowing transit ASes to also reduce traffic.

ABS: 'Community detection is one of the most active fields in complex network analysis,
  due to its potential value in practical applications. Many works inspired by diffierent
  paradigms are devoted to the development of algorithmic solutions allowing the network
  structure in such cohesive subgroups to be revealed. Comparative studies reported
  in the literature usually rely on a performance measure considering the community
  structure as a partition (Rand index, normalized mutual information, etc). However,
  this type of comparison neglects the topological properties of the communities.
  In this paper, we present a comprehensive comparative study of a representative
  set of community detection methods, in which we adopt both types of evaluation.
  Community-oriented topological measures are used to qualify the communities and
  evaluate their deviation from the reference structure. In order to mimic real-world
  systems, we use artificially generated realistic networks. It turns out there is
  no equivalence between the two approaches: a high performance does not necessarily
  correspond to correct topological properties, and vice versa. They can therefore
  be considered as complementary, and we recommend applying both of them in order
  to perform a complete and accurate assessment.'

ABS: Facing the huge traffic volumes involved in todays networks it is of utmost importance
  to deploy efficient network measurement solutions to assist network management and
  traffic engineering tasks correctly, without interfering with normal network operation.
  Sampling techniques contribute effectively for this purpose as the amount of traffic
  processed is reduced, ideally without endangering the accuracy of network statistical
  behavior estimation. Although recent proposals of sampling techniques tend to improve
  the correctness of the estimation process, their underlying overhead is yet considerably
  when handling high traffic volumes. This paper proposes a new traffic sampling technique
  for performing lightweight network measurements. This technique, based on linear
  prediction, is multiadaptive regarding the packet sampling process, allowing to
  reduce significantly the amount of traffic under analysis while maintaining the
  representativeness of network samples for accurate network parameters estimation.
  The performance evaluation of the sampling technique demonstrates the effectiveness
  and versatility of the proposal when considering real traces representing distinct
  traffic load scenarios. The statistical analysis provided evinces that the present
  solution outperforms classic sampling techniques, both in accuracy and amount of
  data involved in the measurement process.

GEOLOC: Minneapolis, MI, US
ABS: 'The unprecedented demand of better privacy and anonymity protection asks for
  unprecedented solution. Companies have been successfully monetizing Internet users
  online profile. Governments wish to hold citizens accountable for everything they
  do on the network. There is an increasing trend of privacy awareness. People also
  demands online anonymity under constant network surveillance. This work explores
  three major problems in three different dimension of privacy enhancing technologies:
  private multi-party computation, blacklistable anonymity and defending against active
  traffic analysis. First, we look at location privacy. One important functionality
  that various location check-in services provide is to let users connect with their
  friends when they are within certain physical proximity. The side effect is, however,
  the service providers learn all the locations users have been to. Currently, existing
  private location proximity tests suffers either information leak by dishonest participants
  or unscalable expensive online computations. In this work we show how two users
  can execute private location proximity test without worrying about that an dishonest
  user or the honest-but-curious server learn any users location. The solution, which
  incorporates environment-derived location tags and novel application of document
  shingling, achieves best security guarantees and optimal efficiency (O(1) complexity)
  in the same time. Second, we take on anonymous blacklisting system. Anonymity and
  access control seems to not get along with each well very well. For example, fearing
  anonymous vandalism, Wikipedia still choose to block edits and registrations via
  open proxies and anonymizing networks like Tor, while many Wikipedia users have
  to use Tor to work around government censorship. Several systems have been proposed
  to aid the dilemma so that user obtains unlinkable access tokens and spend them
  to gain access to online service providers. In case of vandalism, the associated
  access token can be used to blacklist the corresponding user for a certain time
  period. We constructed a new system, Jack, that for the first time has the optimal
  asymptotic complexities in all operations. Meanwhile, Jack achieves its security
  goals under more secure and more realistic threat model. Last but not least, we
  build a framework of defending network ow watermarking, also known as active traffic
  analysis. There has been an arm race between the techniques that carried out watermarking
  and the ones that detect watermarking. However, there is no clear winner and it
  is not clear what lesson we have learned. To this end, we start with a hierarchy
  of modeling adversaries against watermarking attacker and identify possible attack
  strategies for each type of attacker. Eventually we are able to create new attacks
  that is able to detect the watermark with 100% accuracy. More importantly, for the
  first time we extend non-parametric copy attack to the area of ow watermarking.
  We point out some state-of-art ow watermarking algorithms are especially vulnerable
  to our cost efficient copy attacks. We argue that the anonymity network such as
  Tor will benefit greatly from our copy attack at a very low cost of network latency.'

ABS: As the Internet has evolved and grown, an increasing number of nodes (hosts or
  autonomous systems) have become multihomed, i.e., a node is connected to more than
  one network. Mobility can be viewed as a special case of multihoming - as a node
  moves, it unsubscribes from one network and subscribes to another, which is akin
  to one interface becoming inactive and another active. The current Internet architecture
  has been facing significant challenges in effectively dealing with multihoming (and
  consequently mobility), which has led to the emergence of several custom point-solutions.
  The Recursive Inter-Network Architecture (RINA) was recently proposed as a clean-slate
  solution to the current problems of the Internet. In this paper, we present a specification
  of the process of ROuting in Recursive Architectures (RORA). We also perform an
  average-case cost analysis to compare the multihoming/mobility support of RINA,
  against that of other approaches such as LISP and Mobile-IP. Extensive experimental
  results confirm the premise that the RINA architecture and its RORA routing approach
  are inherently better suited for supporting mobility and multihoming.

  aims at reducing a core operational expenditure for the network operator. QoSPlan
  is designed to reduce the cost of deployment and maintenance of network monitoring
  systems. The process involves analysis of pre-existing accounting data to estimate
  a network-wide traffic matrix. Part of this estimation process relates to the generalization
  of QoS-related effective bandwidth coefficients taken from traffic analyzed on the
  network. We offer recommendations on how to appropriately realize QoSPlan to maximize
  its accuracy and effectiveness when applied to different network traffic scenarios.
  This is achieved through a thorough sensitivity analysis of the methods proposed
  using real traffic scenarios and indicative network topologies. We also provide
  an economic analysis of the deployment and maintenance costs associated with QoSPlan
  in comparison to a direct measurement approach, demonstrating cost savings of up
  to 60 % given different topology sizes.

  algorithm called Guaranteed Latency Multicast Scheduling (GLMS) that considers the
  schedule of each packet for multiple time slots. We show that GLMS has several desirable
  features, such as guaranteed latency for all transmitted packets and adaptivity
  to transmission requirements. To relax the time constraint on computing a schedule,
  we further propose a parallel and pipeline processing architecture for GLMS that
  distributes the scheduling task to multiple pipelined processing stages, with N
  processors in each stage, where N is the switch size. Finally, by implementing it
  with simple combination logic circuits, we show that each processor can finish the
  scheduling for one time slot in O(1) time-complexity. We evaluate the performance
  of GLMS extensively against statistical traffic models and real Internet traffic,
  and the results show that the proposed GLMS algorithm can achieve very low average
  packet latency with minimum packet drop ratio

ABS: 'The size of routing tables in backbone routers continues to keep a rapid growth,

  urgent demand for fast routing update due to the increase of mobile communications
  and new emerged Internet functionalities. Furthermore, the link transmission speed
  of backbone routers has increased up to 100Gbps commercially and towards 400Gbps
  Ethernet for Lab experiments, resulting in a raring need of ultra-fast routing lookup.
  Therefore, to achieve high performance, backbone routers must gracefully handle

ABS: In this day and age, the internet is the new resource tool for the masses. It
  has changed the way we live in society and the way people interact with each other.
  There are about nine hundred million people, who are using internet now a day. They
  can use the internet to communicate with each other from all over the world, business
  can do their work over the internet, and students can take online classes and many
  more. Therefore, the availability of internet is very critical for the socio economic
  growth of the society. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the major
  threats for the current Internet because of its ability to create a huge volume
  of malicious data. As a result of it services of internet are severely degraded.
  One of the biggest challenges before researchers is to find the details of such
  attacks because due to damaging reputation issues, most of the commercial sites
  do not even disclose that they were blitzed by such attacks. In this project work,
  we have used the real time attack and legitimate traces in order to perform the
  simulation of DDoS attacks. We have simulated the network topology and attach the
  real time traces with the topology. The impact of attack is measured in terms of
  metrics such as throughput and percentage link utilization.

ABS: Traffic sampling techniques are crucial and extensively used to assist network
  management tasks. Nevertheless, combining accurate network parameters estimation
  and flexible lightweight measurements is an open challenge. In this context, this
  paper proposes a self-adaptive sampling technique, based on linear prediction, which
  allows to reduce significantly the measurement overhead, while assuring that sampled
  traffic reflects the statistical characteristics of the global traffic under analysis.
  The technique is multiadaptive as several parameters are considered in the dynamic
  configuration of the traffic selection process. The devised test scenarios aim at
  exploring the proposed sampling technique ability to join accurate network estimates
  to reduced overhead, using throughput as reference parameter. The evaluation results,
  obtained resorting to real traffic traces representing wired and wireless aggregated
  traffic scenarios and actual network services, prove that the simplicity, flexibility
  and self-adaptability of this technique can be successfully explored to improve
  network measurements efficiency over distinct traffic conditions. For optimization
  purposes, this paper also includes a study of the impact of varying the order of
  prediction, i.e., of considering different degrees of past memory in the self-adaptive
  estimation mechanism. The significance of the obtained results is demonstrated through
  statistical benchmarking.

ABS: The need for network traces has always been a critical element for the success
  of network, and network security, research. However, the plethora of privacy, legal
  and policy issues has often prevented access to collected traces. This has created
  the need for developing anonymization methods and tools to protect the privacy of
  the released traces while preserving utility in the data. A key dilemma in anonymizing
  network traces is whether to preserve IP pseudonym consistency, i.e., whether the
  same IP address is replaced by the same pseudo IP. On one hand, globally-consistent
  prefix-preserving IP address anonymization is subject to various privacy attacks.
  On the other hand, many usages of the trace data require some levels of consistency.
  We solve this dilemma by observing that a better privacy-utility tradeoff can be
  obtained by maintaining temporal pseudonym consistency. That is, we divide flows
  into buckets based on temporal closeness, and anonymize the flows within each bucket
  separately such that pseudonym consistency is maintained within each bucket, but
  broken across buckets. We present a new anonymization method based on these insights.
  Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method provides the needed privacy
  protections with little adverse effects on the utility of the trace

ABS: Broadcast contribution is point-point media transfer from recording sites to
  local editing studios, between studio facilities and to distribution centers. The
  contribution phase has strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements to reliability
  and bandwidth - any error might degrade end users Quality of Experience (QoE) in
  the consecutive distribution phase. Dedicated IP contribution networks has become
  the preferred technology for contribution from content creation sites. Occasionally,
  however, contribution happens at a site without access to a dedicated IP contribution
  network - in which case the broadcaster must utilize less optimal technologies.
  Based on IP, the public Internet may be a superior solution in some scenarios due
  to high bandwidth and geographical coverage - if the internet can conform to strict
  contribution requirements to QoS and QoE. This thesis attempts to give a clear answer
  to this question. Our investigation was done in three parts. First, we uncovered
  recent Internet QoS trends in Norway. We found that the internet has become an Internet
  video delivery platform, which in turn has resulted in bandwidth increase in access
  networks. Bandwidth in residential access links now conforms to contribution requirements.
  ISPs make profit according to the level of offered QoS, broadcasters can therefore
  expect high QoS. Also, broadcasters can buy QoS guarantees, which may be a viable
  and safe solution. Secondly, we recorded over 21 hours of Internet QoS statistics
  on a connection traversing 11 routers and one peering point. The measured level
  of every QoS metric (packet loss, jitter and re-ordering) conformed to professional
  contribution network requirements, except the rate of packet loss bursts. However,
  no burst above 200 ms was recorded and no two consecutive bursts happened within
  a 2 second time frame. Based on this, we explained how simple error control strategies
  can correct or mask packet loss burst with a 200-250 ms delay tradeoff and 15-30%
  bandwidth overhead. Third, we did subjective tests in the Internet with two professional
  JPEG2000 contribution gateways delivered by T-Vips. A full movie was encoded at
  70 Mbit/s, a bitrate used for very high quality contribution, and shown to a test
  panel of 24 participants. By analyzing questionnaires, we proved that contribution
  over the internet yield equally good QoE as cable TV. Also, we found that noticeable
  degradations due to packet loss happened once per hour on average. Furthermore,
  packet loss bursts below 4 ms was generally not visible to the viewers. Because
  the Internet provides both the required QoS and QoE, we concluded that broadcasters
  can do contribution over the Internet at the required level of quality whenever
  this is a favorable option

ABS: In this paper, we explore the use of cluster-based software routers as a way
  to share hardware resources, reduce costs, and save energy. We propose ECO-ALOC,
  an energy-efficient resource allocation mechanism that reconfigures the router according
  to the traffic demands using two modules. The first module provides fine-grained
  energy consumption control by switching CPU operation frequencies among three special
  frequencies. The second module provides long-term power savings by using virtual
  router migration to consolidate the load and shut idle servers down. We simulate
  a cluster-based software router using real traffic traces to evaluate our proposal.
  Results show that ECO-ALOC provides power savings of up to 93% depending on the

  According to the varying traffic rate, the system can adjust the number of active

  and power migration techniques based on our new power model which considers both
  dynamic and static power consumption of all cores. Results on an AMD machine with

  NetBench [19] show that our scheme reduces power consumption by an average of 41.0%
  compared to running with full capacity without any reduction in throughput. It also
  consumes less power than three other approaches, chip-wide DVFS [22], power gating

ABS: 'here is a growing interest in designing high-speed network devices to perform

ABS: Autonomous system (AS) business relationships and their inference have been widely
  studied by network researchers in the past. An important application of inferred
  AS relationships can be the prediction of AS paths between a source and destination
  AS within a model. However, besides knowing the topology and inferred AS relationships,
  AS path prediction within a model needs to be understood in order for us to know
  how we can derive border gateway protocol (BGP) policies from AS relationships.
  In this paper, we shed light onto the predictive capabilities of AS relationships
  by investigating whether they can be translated into BGP policies such that inferred
  AS paths are consistent with real AS paths, e.g., paths observed from BGP routing
  tables. Our findings indicate that enforcing constraints such as the well-known
  valley-free property and the widely assumed preference of customer routes always
  results in a very low consistency for AS path inference. In addition, this is true
  irrespective of whether customer, peer, or provider routes are preferred. Apparently,
  applying such constraints eliminates many correct paths that are observed in BGP
  routing tables and that are propagated in a simple shortest path model where AS
  relationships are ignored. According to our findings, deriving BGP routing policies
  for predicting with high accuracy AS paths in a model directly from AS relationships
  is still difficult.

  routing policies prohibit some paths from carrying traffic and because, on top of
  that, a route-vector protocol may hide paths the routing policies would allow. We
  develop an algebraic theory to address the above and related questions. In particular,
  we characterize a broad class of routing policies for which we can compute in polynomial
  time the minimum number of links whose failure leaves a route-vector protocol without
  a communication path from one given node to another. The theory is applied to a

  via network capabilities, and differentiated packet prioritization. In concert,
  these mechanisms provide 1) a strong static-class bandwidth guarantee, 2) strongly
  guaranteed capability establishment for private end-to-end communication, and a
  linear waiting time guarantee in the number of malicious source domains for capability
  establishment for public services, and 3) globally fair bandwidth allocation for
  capability-protected flows. STRIDE addresses the denial-of-capability problem and
  defends against a Coremelt attack by preventing a botnet from crowding out other
  flows on bottleneck network links. We demonstrate these properties through formal
  analysis and simulation.

  packet coalescing is the best known algorithm for managing the LPI mode and has
  been proved able to get power savings nearing theoretical limits at the expense
  of packet delay when properly tuned. However, in real networks with nonstationary
  traffic conditions, static tuning induces higher than necessary delays. In this

ABS: Independent operator networks are called either Autonomous Systems (AS) or domains.
  Numerous studies based on complex measurement platforms have been carried out for
  over ten years now in order to discover the Internet topology on domain level. The
  routing realized by Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is strongly influenced by commercial
  relationships which exist between domains, because domain operators do not want
  to make public the routes they know, as announcing certain routes would deprive
  them of a possible financial benefit. Consequently, routes available in BGP tables
  are valley-free and they are spanned on the inter-domain hierarchy. This property
  of BGP routes has an impact on the performance of protocols which are proposed to
  assure the QoS. We examined the existing Internet topologies gathered on the domain
  level over the six year period in the context of their hierarchy. We used aSHIIP,
  our random hierarchical topology generator, to induct the hierarchy into the collected
  topologies. We proposed new methods for detecting the core of a network. Thanks
  to this analysis we have been able to put forward solid inter-domain hierarchy induction
  methods which are implemented in our publicly available tool

ABS: Critical services operating over the Internet are increasingly threatened by
  Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. To protect them we propose Epiphany,
  an architecture that hides the service IP addresses so that attackers cannot locate
  and target them. Epiphany provides service access through numerous lightweight proxies,
  presenting a wide target to the attacker. Epiphany has strong location hiding properties;
  no proxy knows the service address. Instead, proxies communicate over ephemeral
  paths controlled by the service. If a specific proxy misbehaves or is attacked it
  can be promptly removed. Epiphany separates proxies into setup and data, and only
  makes setup proxies public, but these use anycast to create distinct network regions.
  Clients in clean networks are not affected by attackers in other networks. Data
  proxies are assigned to clients based on their trust. We evaluate the defense properties
  of Epiphany using simulations and implementations on PlanetLab and a router testbed.

  hosts, and is aware of the name (identifier) of the contents. In this chapter, first,
  we briefly describe the FP7 project CONVERGENCE and its approach to ICN. Second,
  we discuss the needs on measurements required by ICN. ICN is different in several
  aspects, with respect to the current networking architecture. The measurement needs
  in an ICN are virtually endless, as designing an ICN is conceptually equivalent
  to devising a new Internet. Thus, claiming to address this issue in a single chapter
  would be pretentious. However, the study on ICN is in its initial stage and we want
  to focus on some of the most pressing and specific aspects of ICN, namely the scalability
  of its naming and routing functionality. This study is necessary to assess the feasibility
  of ICN, before addressing other metrics of interest. Thus, the third and main part
  of the chapter describes our routing-by-name architecture and reports the results
  of specific measurements on routing issues. Measurements are performed both by means
  of simulations and by using OneLab, an open, global research network that supports
  the development of new network services. Our results show that the proposed architecture,
  designed to improve the scalability of routing tables, is feasible with current
  technology.

ABS: Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) is a very powerful attack on Internet resources
  as well as system resources. Hence, it is imperative to detect these attacks in
  real time else the impact will be irresistible. In this work we propose a new method
  of applying cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm to track variations of the attack characteristic
  variable X(n) from the observed traffic (specific to different kinds of attacks)
  and raise an alarm based on threshold. But often a threshold based mechanism produces
  many false alarms. Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) which is capable
  of removing the abrupt separation between normality and abnormality as well as appropriately
  select the membership function parameters has been used for detection of attacks
  based on CUSUM values. The detection mechanism is well corroborated by experimental
  results.

ABS: The large base of Internet-enabled smartphones provides an excellent opportunity
  for a fine-grained observation of the structure of the Internet and a quantitative
  evaluation of its characteristics. Smartphones can operate as active mobile monitors
  and, coordinated by a central entity, they can probe the network on a local scale.
  Then the results produced by a large number of participants can be merged to obtain
  a detailed graph of the Internet. Besides the design of the measurement framework,
  this paper describes the implementation and validation of a traceroute-like tool
  that is compatible with the Android platform. This confirms that smartphone-based
  crowdsourcing of network properties can be a viable strategy.

ABS: With the continuous development of network security, a variety of traffic anomaly
  detection systems (TADS) have been proposed. However, temporal and spatial correlation
  of them is not understood very well. In this paper, firstly, the spatial-temporal
  characteristics of some metrics are analyzed. Secondly, Markov chain is used to
  model and predict the anomaly scores and a correlation algorithm is proposed to
  correlate results collected from a sequence of windows. Finally, using weighted
  D-S evidence theory, anomaly scores from a variety of detection systems were fused
  to product a more comprehensive detection. In this process, the basic assignment
  functions are carefully designed and information gain is introduced to evaluate
  every system and determine weight. Using some real and synthetic traffic trace from
  backbone networks, we demonstrate that our system can improve the detection rate
  and control the false positive rate.

ABS: Logging-based approaches are suitable for tracing single-packet attacks but incur
  heavy overhead for packet-digest storage as well as time overhead for both path
  recording and recovery. Marking-based approaches incur little trace back overhead
  but are unable to trace single-packet attacks. Recent researches suggest that hybrid
  approaches are more promising in efficiently tracing single-packet attacks. The
  major challenge lies in reducing storage and time overhead while maintaining single-packet
  trace back capability. We presented in this paper a more efficient hybrid approach
  by designing a novel path fragment encoding scheme using the orthogonality of Walsh
  matrix and the degree distribution characteristic of router-level topology. Compared
  to HIT, the most efficient hybrid approach for single-packet trace back to our best
  knowledge, our approach reduces 2/3 of the overhead in both storage and time for
  recording packet paths, and the time over-head for recovering packet paths is also
  reduced by a calculatable amount.

ABS: Traffic anomaly detection systems require not only efficiency and accuracy but
  also the ability of containment. For those special requirements, an anomaly detection
  system is proposed based on Filter-ary-Sketch. It records the traffic in Filter-ary-Sketch
  and detects anomalies over it. When an anomaly is detected, the anomalous dimension
  is notices and malicious buckets are identified. Finally, malicious packets are
  blocked using the packets filter algorithm. Using some traffic traces from backbone
  networks, we demonstrate that our system can detect anomalies with high accuracy,
  low computation and memory costs, and block the packets that are responsible for
  anomalies.

ABS: We present LFR (Loop Free Routing), a new loop-free distance vector routing algorithm,
  which is able to update the shortest paths of a distributed network with n nodes
  in fully dynamic scenarios. If Phi is the total number of nodes affected by a set
  of updates to the network, and phi is the maximum number of destinations for which
  a node is affected, then LFR requires O(Phi . Delta) messages and O(n + Phi . Delts)
  space per node, where Delta is the maximum degree of the nodes of the network. We
  experimentally compare LFR with DUAL, one of the most popular loop-free distance
  vector algorithms, which is part of CISCOs EIGRP protocol and requires O(Phi . Delta)
  messages and O(n . Delta) space per node. The experiments are based on both real-world
  and artificial instances and show that LFR is always the best choice in terms of
  memory requirements, while in terms of messages LFR outperforms DUAL on real-world
  instances, whereas DUAL is the best choice on artificial instances.

YEAR: 2012-00
TOPKEY: passive-2009
GEOLOC: Urbana, IL, US
ABS: 'Linking network flows is an important problem in several security-related applications
  including intrusion detection and anonymity. The flows of interest in these applications
  are commonly relayed by several low-latency nodes, and each node adds an extra/different
  layer of encryption to the traffic payload. As a result, in such applications it
  is infeasible to link network flows by correlating their packet headers and payloads.
  Traffic analysis is a powerful tool in this scenario, as it correlates network flows
  based on their communication patterns, which are not changed due to encryption and
  low-latency communications. Traditional traffic analysis is performed in a passive
  manner; flow patterns are only observed and correlated among different flows to
  find flow relations. The patterns used more commonly for traffic analysis are packet
  timings, sizes, and counts. The main shortcoming of passive traffic analysis is
  not being scalable to large-size applications. For a network with n ingress flows
  and m egress flows passive traffic analysis needs to perform O(mn) flow correlations,
  and O(n) flows need to be communicated among traffic analysis entities. To overcome
  this limitation, recent research introduces an active form for traffic analysis,
  called flow watermarking. Flow watermarking works by first perturbing network flows
  and then observing network flows, looking for the specific perturbation patterns
  in order to link flows. This reduces the computational overhead to O(n) (from O(mn)
  for non-targeted passive analysis) and the communication overhead to O(1) (from
  O(n) in the case of non-targeted passive analysis), since the information used for
  flow linking, the watermark, is self-contained in each flow. In addition to being
  more scalable (in the case of non-targeted traffic analysis), active traffic analysis
  can provide lower false-positive rates than passive traffic a nalysis in linking
  network flows. This is because passive analysis works by correlating flow patterns
  that can be intrinsically correlated among non-linked flows, whereas active traffic
  analysis correlates artificial patterns that are tailored to be highly uncorrelated
  among non-linked flows. In this thesis we study the design, analysis, and implementa
  tion of network flow watermarks. Our research is motivated by two main issues with
  existing flow watermarks: i) previous flow watermarks are not efficient, meaning
  that they need very long network flows in order to successfully detect water-marked
  flows, and, ii) previous watermarks are not invisible, meaning that non-watermarking
  entities (e.g., users, attackers) can tell if a flow has been watermarked. In particular,
  we design an attack, called multi-flow attack, that works on several previously
  proposed flow watermarks. Our multi-flow attack is able to distinguish watermarked
  flows and remove the watermark by observing a handful of watermarked flows. We also
  design two new flow watermarking systems. We design RAINBOW, a non-blind network
  flow watermark. RAINBOW is able to perform very reliable traffic analysis by applying
  tiny perturbations to packet timings. We also design a blind flow watermark, SWIRL,
  that inserts watermarks that are flow-dependent. For both of the proposed schemes,
  we analyze their de- tection performance both theoretically and through experiments.
  We also evaluate watermark invisibility for both of the schemes. A flow watermark
  inserts a single bit of information on flows, carrying the message that these flows
  have been observed previously. However, in some applications more information needs
  to be piggybacked on network flows, giving information about the location they were
  observed, the entity who tagged them, etc. We call such tags composed of several
  bits of information flow fingerprints. We design a flow fingerprinting system, called
  Fancy, that is able to send tens of bits of information reliably using fairly short
  length of network flows. Finally, we introduce two new applications for network
  flow watermarking. The first application uses flow watermarks to detect botmasters
  and infected machines corresponding to a centralized botnet, i.e., an IRC botnet.
  We also propose to use our SWIRL watermark to mitigate a threat against the Tor
  anonymity system, the Tor congestion attack.'

ABS: Reducing the power consumption of core Internet routers is important for both
  Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and router vendors. ISPs can reduce their Carbon
  footprint and operational costs, while router manufacturers can achieve higher switching
  capacity per rack space. In this work, we examine the impact of packet buffers on
  the power consumption of backbone router line-cards. We argue that Gigabytes of
  always-on SRAM and DRAM buffers account for around 10% of the power, but are actively
  used only during transient periods of congestion. We propose a simple and practical
  algorithm for activating buffers incrementally as needed and putting them to sleep
  when not in use. We evaluate our algorithm on traffic traces from carrier and enterprise
  networks, via simulations in ns2, and by implementing it on a programmable-router
  test-bed. Our study shows that much of the energy associated with off-chip packet
  buffers can be eliminated with negligible impact on traffic performance. Dynamic
  adjustment of active router buffer size provides a low-complexity low-risk mechanism
  of saving energy that is amenable for incremental deployment in networks today.

ABS: Having a better understanding of the properties of network traffic can help in
  both evaluating current networking protocols and in creating more realistic models
  which might help in improving todays Internet service. Based on one month traceroute
  data from 6 different sources to more than 380 destinations, we present an analysis
  of how the hop count (HC) varies as seen by IPs in the same Autonomous System (AS)
  and same country, IPs in the same country but different AS, and IPs in different
  AS and different country. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research studied
  the HC overlap as seen by different IPs located in various ASs and countries. Our
  results show that IPs in the same AS have a high degree of overlap in terms of HC
  as compared to IPs in the same country. This HC overlap also drops significantly
  as we compare IPs in different ASs and countries.

ABS: The literature of network traffic analysis has successfully investigated several
  sophisticated models to be used in computer network traffic forecasting. Although
  these models have shown very good results in many controlled studies, the complexity
  of their implementation may be an important factor for preventing their large adoption
  in real production environment. We advocate that simpler forecasting models can
  also show very good accuracy - similar to the complex ones - for real scenarios
  of LAN/MAN network traffic, and being less intricate to implement and deploy in
  practical network management applications. In this paper we investigate the goodness
  of fit of nine classic forecast models applied to IP traffic samples drawn from
  real networks. The obtained results support our hypothesis given that the simpler
  investigated models demonstrate prediction accuracy very close to the advanced models
  for the studied scenarios.

ABS: For a long time, traceroute measurements combined with alias resolution methods
  have been the sole way to collect Internet router level maps. Recently, a new approach
  has been introduced with the use of a multicast management tool, mrinfo, and a recursive
  probing scheme. In this paper, after analyzing advantages and drawbacks of probing
  approaches based on traceroute and mrinfo, we propose a hybrid discovery tool, Merlin
  (MEasure the Router Level of the INternet), mixing mrinfo and traceroute probes.
  Using a central server controlling a set of distributed vantage points in order
  to increase the exploration coverage while limiting the probing redundancy, the
  purpose of Merlin is to provide an accurate router level map inside a targeted Autonomous
  System (AS). Merlin also takes advantage of alias resolution methods to reconnect
  scattered multicast components. To evaluate the performance of Merlin, we report
  experimental results describing its efficiency in topology exploration and reconstruction
  of several ASes.

TITLE: 'Multifaceted defense against Distributed Denial of Service attacks: prevention,

YEAR: 2012-08
TOPKEY: ddos-20070804
GEOLOC: Gothenburg, SE
ABS: 'Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks can be so powerful that they can
  easily deplete the computing resources or bandwidth of the potential targets, by
  flooding massive packets. Internet infrastructures and network applications, including
  social services and communication systems for emergency management, are under the
  threat of the DDoS problem. This thesis aims at providing efficient methods which
  can detect and mitigate DDoS attacks, meanwhile keeping the network performance
  degradation as little as possible. Dealing with DDoS attacks is challenging, due
  to their multifaceted properties: dynamic attack rates, various kinds of targets,
  big scale of botnets, etc. Multifaceted nature of DDoS attacks justifies the need
  for multifaceted defense. Thus we address the DDoS problems from different aspects.
  In particular, in the thesis we present an adaptive port-hopping method to address
  application-level DDoS problems. The method enables multiparty applications to communicate
  via ports changed periodically. Thus, the adversary cannot effectively attack the
  communication ports of the targets. The proposed method can deal with clock drifts
  among the communication parties without the need of acknowledgments or time server.
  To address the bandwidth-flooding attacks, in the thesis, we propose and present
  SIEVE, a lightweight distributed filtering method. Depending on the adversarys ability,
  SIEVE can provide a standalone filter for moderate adversary models and a complementary
  filter which can enhance the performance of strong and more complex methods for
  stronger adversary models. SIEVE uses an overlay network to form a distributed sieve
  and uses lightweight authenticators (e.g. source IP addresses) to filter packets.
  SIEVE includes also a simple solution to protect connection setup procedures between
  legitimate clients and protected servers, which can also be applied to address the
  Denial-of-Capability (DoC) problem. In this thesis we present how to complement
  network-capability mechanisms by addressing the Denial-of-Capability problem. Mitigating
  DDoS attacks are challenging not only for the end hosts, but also for the network.
  By building on earlier work and improving on distribution of control aspects, a
  proactive method, which we call CluB, is proposed in this thesis to mitigate DDoS
  attacks. The method balances the effectiveness-overhead trade-off by addressing
  the issue of granularity of control in the network. CluB can collaborate with different
  routing policies in the network, including contemporary datagram options. We estimate
  the effectiveness of the method and also study a set of factors for tuning the granularity
  of control. The thesis also studies the problem of monitoring high-speed traffic
  and detecting DDoS-related anomalies in a data streaming fashion to offer a detection
  at an early stage in the core network, thus activating appropriate DDoS mitigations
  only when necessary. We propose an IP-prefix based aggregation method to monitor
  and detect DDoS-related anomalies. Furthermore, we investigate the design space
  of combining parallel-distributed data streaming with both online detection and
  baseline profile maintenance, and give detailed solutions for achieving this. The
  proposed data streaming based DDoS defense solutions are implemented upon a parallel-distributed
  data stream engine.'

ABS: Recently, as the serious damage caused by DDoS attacks increases, the rapid detection
  of the attack and the proper response mechanisms are urgent. Signature based DDoS
  detection systems cannot detect new attacks. Current anomaly based detection systems
  are also unable to detect all kinds of new attacks, because they are designed to
  restricted applications on limited environments. However, existing security mechanisms
  do not provide effective defense against these attacks, or the defense capability
  of some mechanisms is only limited to specific DDoS attacks. It is necessary to
  analyze the fundamental features of DDoS attacks because these attacks can easily
  vary the used port/protocol, or operation method. Also lot of research work has
  been done in detecting the attacks using machine learning techniques. Still what
  are the relevant features and which technique will be more suitable one for the
  attack detection is an open question. In this paper, we use the chi-square and Information
  gain feature selection mechanisms for selecting the important attributes. With the
  selected attributes, various machine learning models, like Navies Bayes, C4.5, SVM,
  KNN, K-means and Fuzzy c-means clustering are developed for efficient detection
  of DDoS attacks. Then our experimental results show that Fuzzy c-means clustering
  gives better accuracy in identifying the attacks.

ABS: 'An Internet hitlist is a set of addresses that cover and can represent the the
  Internet as a whole. Hitlists have long been used in studies of Internet topology,
  reachability, and performance, serving as the destinations of traceroute or performance
  probes. Most early topology studies used manually generated lists of prominent addresses,
  but evolution and growth of the Internet make human maintenance untenable. Random
  selection scales to todays address space, but most random addresses fail to respond.
  In this paper we present what we believe is the first automatic generation of hitlists
  informed censuses of Internet addresses. We formalize the desirable characteristics
  of a hitlist: responsiveness, each representative responds to pings; completeness,
  they cover all the allocated IPv4 address space; and stability, list evolution is
  minimized when possible. We quantify the accuracy of our automatic hitlists, showing
  that only one-third of the Internet allows informed selection of representatives.
  Of informed representatives, 50-60% are likely to respond three months later, and
  we show that causes for non-responses are likely due to dynamic addressing (so no
  stable representative exists) or firewalls. In spite of these limitations, we show
  that the use of informed hitlists can add 1.7 million edge links (a 5% growth) to
  traceroute-based Internet topology studies Our hitlists are available free-of-charge
  and are in use by several other research projects.'

ABS: In response to high-profile Internet outages, BGP security variants have been
  proposed to prevent the propagation of bogus routing information. To inform discussions
  of which variant should be deployed in the Internet, we quantify the ability of
  the main protocols (origin authentication, soBGP, S-BGP, and data-plane verification)
  to blunt traffic-attraction attacks; i.e., an attacker that deliberately attracts
  traffic to drop, tamper, or eavesdrop on packets. Intuition suggests that an attacker
  can maximize the traffic he attracts by widely announcing a short path that is not
  flagged as bogus by the secure protocol. Through simulations on an empirically-determined
  AS-level topology, we show that this strategy is surprisingly effective, even when
  the network uses an advanced security solution like S-BGP or data-plane verification.
  Worse yet, we show that these results underestimate the severity of attacks. We
  prove that finding the most damaging strategy is NP-hard, and show how counterintuitive
  strategies, like announcing longer paths, announcing to fewer neighbors, or triggering
  BGP loop-detection, can be used to attract even more traffic than the strategy above.
  These counterintuitive examples are not merely hypothetical; we searched the empirical
  AS topology to identify specific ASes that can launch them. Finally, we find that
  a clever export policy can often attract almost as much traffic as a bogus path
  announcement. Thus, our work implies that mechanisms that police export policies
  (e.g., defensive filtering) are crucial, even if S-BGP is fully deployed.

ABS: In order to realistically simulate algorithms or evaluate P2P overlay topologies,
  a detailed model of the underlying router topology is required. Since actively measuring
  this topology is extremely laborious and furthermore a waste of network resources,
  traditionally topology generators are used in order to create synthetic router-level
  graphs. For this, usually graph models are selected that are known to generate graphs
  which are similar to the actual Internet in respect to a certain metric like e.g.
  vertex degree distribution. These models are often superseded or adjusted when new
  metrics are being introduced which better differentiate between graphs. Furthermore
  it has been shown, that graphs that are similar in respect to e.g. vertex degree
  distribution can be very different from a structural point of view. In this paper
  Top-Gen, a generic, extensible and easy-to-use topology generation platform is presented.
  It contains a topology generation module which bases the generation of router-level
  graphs on the Internets underlying principles and the technological constraints
  of routers rather than trying to effectuate similarity in respect to a certain metric.
  Apart from describing TopGens general topology generation approach, graphs created
  with its Internet topology module are evaluated and found to be encouragingly similar
  to real-world datasets in various respects.

  over distributed data, crosses the specified threshold. The challenge lies in being
  able to execute the queries with the minimal amount of communication necessary for
  update propagation. We address the challenge by proposing schemes for converting
  the client threshold condition into conditions on individual distributed data sources
  such that (1) violation of the client threshold occurs only if one or more source
  conditions are violated (zero false negative), and (2) the number of source violations
  when client threshold is not violated is small (minimize false positives). Using
  performance evaluation we show that our algorithms result in up to an order of magnitude
  less number of false positives compared to the approaches in the literature.'

  relevant to the study of Internet topologies, such as the generation of synthetic
  topologies to represent the Internets AS topology. We derive a new metric that enables
  exactly such a structural comparison: the weighted spectral distribution. We then
  apply this metric to three aspects of the study of the Internets AS topology. i)
  We use it to quantify the effect of changing the mixing properties of a simple synthetic
  network generator. ii) We use this quantitative understanding to examine the evolution
  of the Internets AS topology over approximately seven years, finding that the distinction
  between the Internet core and periphery has blurred over time. iii) We use the metric
  to derive optimal parameterizations of several widely used AS topology generators
  with respect to a large-scale measurement of the real AS topology.'

ABS: Internet exchange points (IXPs) are an important ingredient of the Internet AS-level
  ecosystem - a logical fabric of the Internet made up of about 30,000 ASes and their
  mutual business relationships whose primary purpose is to control and manage the
  flow of traffic. Despite the IXPs critical role in this fabric, little is known
  about them in terms of their peering matrices (i.e., who peers with whom at which
  IXP) and corresponding traffic matrices (i.e., how much traffic do the different
  ASes that peer at an IXP exchange with one another). In this paper, we report on
  an Internet-wide traceroute study that was specifically designed to shed light on
  the unknown IXP-specific peering matrices and involves targeted traceroutes from
  publicly available and geographically dispersed vantage points. Based on our method,
  we were able to discover and validate the existence of about 44K IXP-specific peering
  links - nearly 18K more links than were previously known. In the process, we also
  classified all known IXPs depending on the type of information required to detect
  them. Moreover, in view of the currently used inferred AS-level maps of the Internet
  that are known to miss a significant portion of the actual AS relationships of the
  peer-to-peer type, our study provides a new method for augmenting these maps with
  IXP-related peering links in a systematic and informed manner.

TITLE: A hash-based path identification scheme for DDoS attacks defense

TOPKEY: topology-skitter-ipv4
GEOLOC: Ningbo, CN
ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a major threat to todayas cyber
  security. Defense against these attacks is complicated by source IP address spoofing,
  which is exploited by attackers to conceal source IP addresses and localities of
  malicious traffic. In this paper, we propose HPi (Hash-based Path Identification),
  a novel packet marking scheme to defeat DDoS attacks regardless of forged IP addresses.
  Our scheme makes full use of a packetas 16-bit IP Identification field to generate
  a unique identifier corresponding to a path the packet traverses. Each router along
  the path hashes the last 16 bits of its IP address into the IP Identification field.
  Thus the victim can identify every single received packet as legitimate or malicious
  on a per packet basis with high accuracy. And we develop different filtering strategies
  for victim servers with different capabilities. We also propose a new packet filtering
  mechanism, the HPi2HC filter, for the victim to distinguish between legitimate and
  malicious packets more accurately based on tuple of each packet. Simulation results
  show that the performance of our scheme is still quite promising even when only
  half of the routers in the network participate in packet marking. The HPi scheme
  is also lightweight, supporting incremental deployment, and is robust against randomly
  initial values in IP Identification field forged by sophisticated attackers.

ABS: Existing models for Internet Autonomous System (AS) topology generation make
  structural assumptions about the AS graph. Those assumptions typically stem from
  beliefs about the true properties of the Internet, e.g. hierarchy and power-laws,
  which arise from incorrect interpretations of incomplete observations of the AS
  topology. In this paper we compare AS topology generation models with several observed
  AS topologies without making assumptions as to the relative importance of different
  topological characteristics. We find that although existing AS topology models capture
  degree-based properties well, they fail to capture the complexity of the local interconnection
  structure between ASes. We use a wide range of metrics including the weighted spectral
  distribution and make it available as toolbox. We show that the shortcomings of
  existing models stem from underestimating the complexity of connectivity in the
  core due to incomplete understanding of collected data limitations, and narrow focus
  on particular aspects of the AS topology structure.

ABS: In this paper we study the structural evolution of the AS topology as inferred
  from two different datasets over a period of seven years. We use a variety of topological
  metrics to analyze the structural differences revealed in the AS topologies inferred
  from the two different datasets. In particular, to focus on the evolution of the
  relationship between the core and the periphery, we make use of the weighted spectral
  distribution. We find that the traceroute dataset has increasing difficulty in sampling
  the periphery of the AS topology, largely due to limitations inherent to active
  probing. Such a dataset has too limited a view to properly observe topological changes
  at the AS-level compared to a dataset largely based on BGP data. We also highlight
  limitations in current measurements that require a better sampling of particular
  topological properties of the Internet. Our results indicate that the Internet is
  changing from a core-centered, strongly customer-provider oriented, disassortative
  network, to a soft-hierarchical, peering-oriented, assortative network.

ABS: The discovery of autonomous systems (ASes) interconnections and the inference
  of their commercial type of relationships (ToR) has been motivated by the need to
  accurately calculate AS-level paths. An inherent problem in current algorithms is
  their extensive use of heuristics, causing unbounded errors that are spread over
  all inferred relationships. We propose a near-deterministic algorithm for solving
  the ToR inference problem that uses the Internets core, a dense sub-graph of top-level
  ASes. We test several methods for creating such a core and demonstrate the robustness
  of the algorithm to the cores size and density, the inference period, and errors
  in the core. We evaluate the algorithm using AS-level paths collected from RouteViews
  BGP paths and DIMES traceroute measurements. Our proposed algorithm deterministically
  infers over 95% of the approximately 58,000 AS topology links using a week worth
  of data and as little as 20 ASes in the core. The algorithm infers 2-3 times more
  peer-to-peer relationships in links discovered only by DIMES than in RouteViews,
  validating the need for a broad and diverse Internet measurement effort.

ABS: Many peer-to-peer distributed applications can benefit from accurate predictions
  of Internet path performance. Existing approaches either 1) achieve high accuracy
  for sophisticated path properties, but adopt an unscalable centralized approach,
  or 2) are lightweight and decentralized, but work only for latency prediction. In
  this paper, we present the design and implementation of iPlane Nano, a library for
  delivering Internet path information to peer-to-peer applications. iPlane Nano is
  itself a peer-to-peer application, and scales to a large number of end hosts with
  little centralized infrastructure and with a low cost of participation. The key
  enabling idea underlying iPlane Nano is a compact model of Internet routing. Our
  model can accurately predict end-to-end PoP-level paths, latencies, and loss rates
  between arbitrary hosts on the Internet, with 70% of AS paths predicted exactly
  in our evaluation set. Yet our model can be stored in less than 7MB and updated
  with approximately 1MB/day. Our evaluation of iPlane Nano shows that it can provide
  significant performance improvements for large-scale applications. For example,
  iPlane Nano yields near-optimal download performance for both small and large files
  in a P2P content delivery system.

ABS: This paper aims to improve on existing methods by providing a near-deterministic
  inference scheme (ND-ToR ) for solving the ToR problem. The input for ND-ToR is
  the Internet Core, a sub-graph that consists of the globally top-level providers
  of the Internet and their interconnecting links with their already inferred relationship
  types. Theoretically, given an accurately classified core, the algorithm deterministically
  infers most of the remaining AS relationships using the AS-level paths relative
  to this core, without incurring additional inference errors. In real-world scenarios,
  where the core and AS-level paths can contain errors (due to misconfigurations or
  measurements mistakes), the algorithm introduces minimal inference mistakes. We
  show that ND-ToR has relaxed requirements from the core, and proves to be robust
  under changes in its definition, size and density.

ABS: Communities, usually thought of as groups of nodes with better connections between
  its members than with the remainder of the network, represent basic structures for
  understanding the organization of complex networks.  We have analyzed the community
  structure in a corpus of more than 100 large social and information networks. Network
  communities tend to exist only at small size scales of up to about 100 nodes, while
  at larger and larger size scales network communities become less and less community-
  like.   Relatedly,  while  small  networks  often  exhibit  fairly unambiguous  community
  structure, large networks have a nested core-periphery structure, consisting of
  a large moderately well-connected core and a large number of small very well-connected
  communities barely connected to the core. We also describe a model in which such
  network structures arise naturally from an iterative local edge attachment mechanism.

ABS: To measure the IPv6 internet AS-level topology, a network topology discovery
  system, called Dolphin, was developed. By comparing the measurement result of Dolphin
  with that of CAIDAs Scamper, it was found that the IPv6 Internet at AS level, similar
  to other complex networks, is also scale-free but the exponent of its degree distribution
  is 1.2, which is much smaller than that of the IPv4 Internet and most other scale-free
  networks. In order to explain this feature of IPv6 Internet we argue that the degree
  exponent is a measure of uniformity of the degree distribution. Then, for the purpose
  of modeling the networks, we propose a new model based on the two major factors
  affecting the exponent of the EBA model. It breaks the lower bound of degree exponent
  which is 2 for most models. To verify the validity of this model, both theoretical
  and experimental analyses have been carried out. Finally, we demonstrate how this
  model can be successfully used to reproduce the topology of the IPv6 Internet.

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service Attacks continue to pose major threats to the Internet.
  In order to traceback attack sources (i.e., IP addresses), a well studied approach
  is Probabilistic Packet Marking (PPM), where each intermediate router of a packet
  marks it with a certain probability, enabling a victim host to traceback the attack
  source. In a recent study, we showed how attackers can take advantage of probabilistic
  nature of packet markings in existing PPM schemes to create spoofed marks, hence
  compromising traceback. In this paper, we propose a new PPM scheme called TTL-based
  PPM (TPM) scheme, where each packet is marked with a probability inversely proportional
  to the distance traversed by the packet so far. Thus, packets that have to traverse
  longer distances are marked with higher probability, compared to those that have
  to traverse shorter distances. This ensures that a packet is marked with much higher
  probability by intermediate routers than by traditional mechanisms, hence reducing
  the effectiveness of spoofed packets reaching victims. Using formal analysis and
  simulations using real Internet topology maps, we show how our TPM scheme can effectively
  trace DDoS attackers even in presence of spoofing when compared to existing schemes.

ABS: Tracing attack packets to their sources, known as IP traceback, is an important
  step to counter distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we
  propose a novel packet logging based (i.e., hash-based) traceback scheme that requires
  an order of magnitude smaller processing and storage cost than the hash-based scheme
  proposed by Snoeren et al. [1], thereby being able to scalable to much higher link
  speed (e.g., OC-768). The baseline idea of our approach is to sample and log a small
  percentage (e.g., 3.3%) of packets. The challenge of this low sampling rate is that
  much more sophisticated techniques need to be used for traceback. Our solution is
  to construct the attack tree using the correlation between the attack packets sampled
  by neighboring routers. The scheme using naive independent random sampling does
  not perform well due to the low correlation between the packets sampled by neighboring
  routers. We invent a sampling scheme that improves this correlation and the overall
  efficiency significantly. Another major contribution of this work is that we introduce
  a novel information-theoretic framework for our traceback scheme to answer important
  questions on system parameter tuning and the fundamental tradeoff between the resource
  used for traceback and the traceback accuracy. Simulation results based on real-world
  network topologies (e.g., Skitter) match very well with results from the information-theoretic
  analysis. The simulation results also demonstrate that our traceback scheme can
  achieve high accuracy, and scale very well to a large number of attackers (e.g.,
  5000+).

ABS: The defense against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is one of the
  primary concerns on the Internet today. IP spoofing makes it difficult for the victim
  to determine the packets true origin. There is a need for a mechanism that could
  rapidly trace back to the attacks origins for the victim. This paper presents a
  two-step traceback scheme to track DDoS attack source by dividing the tracing process
  into two steps. In the first step, Packet Marking Method based on Autonomous System
  (ASPMM) is adopted to determine the attack-originating Autonomous System (AS). In
  the second step, Non-repeated Probabilistic Packet Marking (NRPPM) is used to identify
  the exact origin of the attacks in the specific AS. Compared with previous algorithms,
  the two-step traceback scheme has the benefits of low bandwidth consumption, quick
  convergence speed, light computational overhead of address recombination, it can
  decrease the number of packets the path reconstruction needs, and improve the efficiency
  of path reconstruction, hence making it possible to trace the DDoS attack source
  rapidly.

ABS: Researchers have proposed a variety of Internet topology models. However almost
  all of them focus on generating one graph based on one single static source graph.
  On the other hand, Internet topology is evolving over time continuously with the
  addition and deletion of nodes and edges. If a model is based on all the topologies
  in the past, instead of one of them, it will be more accurate and closer to the
  real world topology. In this paper, we study the Internet As-level topology time-series
  from two different sources and find that both of them obey four same dynamic graph
  patterns. Then we propose a mode that can infer the topology in the future based
  on all the topologies in the past. Through theoretical and experimental analysis,
  we prove the topology that our model generates can match both the static and dynamic
  graph patterns. In addition, the parameters in the model are meaningful. Finally,
  we theoretically and experimentally prove that these parameters are directly related
  to some important graph characteristics.

ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a major threat to todayA?s
  cyber security. Defense against these attacks is complicated by source IP address
  spoofing. The Path Identification (Pi) mechanism is a promising technique to defend
  against DDoS attacks with IP spoofing. In the Pi scheme, each router marks forwarding
  packets to generate particular identifiers corresponding to different paths, which
  can be used to distinguish between malicious packets and legitimate ones. To improve
  the previous Pi scheme, we suggest that the victim record not only the Pi mark of
  each packet but also its hop count (HC). Thus the victim can use the A?Pi, HCA?
  tuple to identify and discard malicious packets instead of Pi more effectively.
  By theoretical analysis and simulations based on actual Internet topologies, we
  demonstrate our scheme, Pi2HC, outperforms previous Pi. We also show that Pi2HC
  is robust against spoofed initial Time-to-Live (TTL) values by sophisticated attackers.

ABS: Layer 2 traceback is an important component of end-to end packet traceback. Whilst
  IP traceback identifies the origin network, L2 traceback extends the process to
  provide a more fine-grained result. Other known proposals have exposed the difficulties
  of L2 traceback in switched ethernet. We build on our earlier work and improve in
  a number of dimensions. Memory requirements are decreased by maintaining connection
  records rather than logging all frames. Our switchport resolution algorithm provides
  error detection by correlating MAC address table values from two adjacent switches.
  Our solution also takes stock of potential transformations to packet data as this
  leaves the local network. We have implemented the core algorithm and used data from
  available WAN traces to demonstrate the potential memory efficiency of our approach.

ABS: Denial of Service (DoS) has been one of the most serious network security problems
  in recent years. There has been a lot of related work and techniques which focuses
  on detection and defense against DoS attacks. One of these techniques is using machine
  learning methods that can be used for distinguishing between DoS traffic and legitimate
  traffic. In this paper we introduce an efficient and accurate classification method
  based clustering techniques for detecting DoS attacks. For this work, we examine
  both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods and compare their results.
  We observed that, our unsupervised method is able to find new attacks with high
  accuracy. In all tests it has demonstrated high detection accuracy compared with
  the supervised methods. We apply K-Means and Expectation Maximization, and Gustafson-Kessel
  clustering algorithms for unsupervised approach, and NaA-ve Bayes Kernel Estimation,
  WAODE, and LWL classifiers for supervised approach. We validate our work with KDD
  CUP 1999 data set and data which has been collected through simulation. The results
  have shown that unsupervised learning methods have high accuracy in distinguishing
  DoS attacks.

ABS: Many models have been proposed to generate Internet Autonomous System (AS) topologies,
  most of which make structural assumptions about the AS graph. In this paper we compare
  AS topology generation models with several observed AS topologies. In contrast to
  most previous works, we avoid making assumptions about which topological properties
  are important to characterize the AS topology. Our analysis shows that, although
  matching degree-based properties, the existing AS topology generation models fail
  to capture the complexity of the local interconnection structure between ASs. Furthermore,
  we use BGP data from multiple vantage points to show that additional measurement
  locations significantly affect local structure properties, such as clustering and
  node centrality. Degree-based properties, however, are not notably affected by additional
  measurements locations . These observations are particularly valid in the core.
  The shortcomings of AS topology generation models stems from an underestimation
  of the complexity of the connectivity in the core caused by inappropriate use of
  BGP data.

ABS: The analysis on Internet topological structure is crucial for real application
  and further development of network. By the analysis of a long period of AS-level
  topology data, the evolution relationship between the major network characteristics
  and corresponding node degrees are deduced. Meanwhile, several important network
  hierarchical characteristics and the influence of high-level ASes on the network
  topology are obtained by the analysis on snapshot data. Using hierarchical model,
  this paper proves that the networkas hierarchy is important to its topology. With
  the analysis results of two aspects, we draw the conclusion that Internet AS-level
  topology shows a very slow homogenization and the high-level nodes represented by
  high-level ASes are the main reason for network topologyas stability, such as cluster,
  power-law and hierarchy.

ABS: Over the past several years, a number of metrics have been introduced to characterize
  the topology of complex networks. We perform a statistical analysis of real data
  sets, representing the topology of different real-world networks. First, we show
  that some metrics are either fully related to other topological metrics or significantly
  limited in the range of their possible values. Second, we observe that subsets of
  metrics are highly correlated, indicating redundancy among them. Our study thus
  suggests that the set of commonly used metrics is too extensive to concisely characterize
  the topology of complex networks. It also provides an important basis for classification
  and unification of a definite set of metrics that would serve in future topological
  studies of complex networks.

ABS: An increasing number of synthetic topology generators are available, each claiming
  to produce representative Internet topologies. Every generator has its own parameters,
  allowing the user to generate topologies with different characteristics. However,
  there exist no clear guidelines on tuning the value of these parameters in order
  to obtain a topology with specific characteristics. In this paper we optimize the
  parameters of several topology generators to match a given Internet topology. The
  optimization is performed either with respect to the link density, or to the spectrum
  of the normalized Laplacian matrix. Contrary to approaches in the literature that
  rely only on the largest eigenvalues, we take into account the set of all eigenvalues.
  However, we show that on their own the eigenvalues cannot be used to construct a
  metric for optimizing parameters. Instead we present a weighted spectral method
  which simultaneously takes into account all the properties of the graph.

ABS: Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks have emerged as a popular means
  of causing mass targeted service disruptions, often for extended periods of time.
  The relative ease and low costs of launching such attacks, supplemented by the current
  woeful state of any viable defense mechanism, have made them one of the top threats
  to the Internet community today. While distributed packet logging and/or packet
  marking have been explored in the past for DDoS attack traceback/mitigation, we
  propose to advance the state of the art by using a novel distributed divide-and-conquer
  approach in designing a new data dissemination architecture that efficiently tracks
  attack sources. The main focus of our work is to tackle the three disjoint aspects
  of the problem, namely attack tree construction, attack path frequency detection,
  and packet to path association, independently and to use succinct recurrence relations
  to express their individual implementations. We also evaluate the network traffic
  and storage overhead induced by our proposed deployment on real-life Internet topologies,
  supporting hundreds of victims each subject to thousands of high-bandwidth flows
  simultaneously, and conclude that we can truly achieve single packet traceback guarantees
  with minimal overhead and high efficiency.

ABS: A high level analysis tool was developed for aiding in the analysis of large
  volumes of network telescope traffic, and in particular the comparisons of data
  collected from multiple telescope sources. Providing a visual means for the evaluation
  of worm propagation algorithms has also been achieved. By using a Hilbert curve
  as a means of ordering points within the visualization space, the concept of nearness
  between numerically sequential network blocks was preserved. The design premise
  and initial results obtained using the tool developed are discussed, and a number
  of future extensions proposed.

ABS: One of the challenges of large-scale network simulations is the lack of scalable
  and realistic Internet topology generators. Previous topology generators are either
  not scalable to millions of nodes, or not able to capture characteristics of the
  Internet topology. In this work, we propose a topology generator which can generate
  accurate large-scale models of the Internet. We extract the AS (autonomous system)
  level and router level topology of the Internet with various data sources such as
  BGP routing tables and traceroute records. With the real Internet topology, we infer
  the AS topology and the commercial relationship among ASes. We also group the routers
  into clusters according to their positions in the Internet. A compact routing core
  is built with the AS topology and router cluster topology. Each generated topology
  consists of the routing core and a set of end-hosts connected to router clusters.
  The generated topology is realistic since its routing core is extracted from Internet.
  We make the assumption of uniform routing policy within an AS. Therefore, the routing
  path calculation of any source/destination pair consists of finding the AS path
  for the source/destination ASes and finding the router level path within each AS
  in the AS path. Since the routing pate depends only on the routing core, its size
  is independent of the number of end-hosts in the generated topology.

ABS: Simulating the Internet is a complex problem. To be able to do that extensive
  analysis for the Internet structure needs to be carried out. This is done to maintain
  the main characteristics of the growth of the Internet and gain further understanding
  about its structure. We use the k-shell decomposition algorithm to analyze and visualize
  the Internet on the Autonomous System level (AS-level). The data used for this analysis
  is gathered from two major AS-connectivity measurement efforts (i.e CAIDA and DIMES).
  As well as analyzing the data gathered, a validation process is applied on this
  data to ensure the reliability of the Autonomous Systems (ASes) edges, then the
  validated data is analyzed using k-shell decomposition. Furthermore, we extend k-shell
  decomposition to account for the directedness of the AS graph. Afterwards, we compare
  the results gained before and after the validation process to explore the impact
  of removing the invalid ASes edges on the Internetas structure and its connectivity

ABS: Traceroute sampling is an important technique in exploring the internet router
  graph and the autonomous system graph. Although it is one of the primary techniques
  used in calculating statistics about the internet, it can introduce bias that corrupts
  these estimates. This paper reports on a theoretical and experimental investigation
  of a new technique to reduce the bias of traceroute sampling when estimating the
  degree distribution. We develop a new estimator for the degree of a node in a traceroute-sampled
  graph; validate the estimator theoretically in ErdEos-RAenyi graphs and, through
  computer experiments, for a wider range of graphs; and apply it to produce a new
  picture of the degree distribution of the autonomous system graph.

ABS: Internet worm attacks have become increasingly more frequent and have had a major
  impact on the economy, making the detection and prevention of these attacks a top
  security concern. Several countermeasures have been proposed and evaluated in recent
  literature. However, the eect of these proposed defensive mechanisms on legitimate
  competing traffic has not been analyzed. The first contribution of this thesis is
  a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of several of these proposed mechanisms,
  including a measure of their effect on normal web browsing activities. In addition,
  we introduce a new defensive approach that can easily be implemented on existing
  hosts, and which significantly reduces the rate of spread of worms using TCP connections
  to perform the infiltration. Our approach has no measurable effect on legitimate
  traffic. The second contribution is presenting a variant of the flash worm that
  we term Compact Flash or CFlash that is capable of spreading even faster than its
  predecessor. We perform a comparative study between the flash worm and the CFlash
  worm using a full-detail packet-level simulator, and the results show the increase
  in propagation rate of the new worm given the same set of parameters. The third
  contribution is the study of the behavior of TCP based worms in MANETs. We develop
  an analytical model for the worm spread of TCP worms in the MANETs environment that
  accounts for payloadsize, bandwidthsharing, radio range, nodal density and several
  other parameters specific for MANET topologies. We also present numerical solutions
  for the model and verify the results using packetlevel simulations. The results
  show that the analytical model developed here matches the results of the packetlevel
  simulation in most cases.

ABS: Distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) pose an immense threat to the Internet.
  The most studied solution is to let routers probabilistically mark packets with
  partial path information during packet forwarding, which is referred as Probabilistic
  Packet Marking (PPM). In this paper, we study the effect of simple attacker strategies
  to spoof the markings to impede victims capacity to traceback. We show that random
  marking is sufficient to impede the victim from tracing the attackers. A simple
  enhancement based on IP path length distribution makes it harder for the victim.
  We hope that this analysis would help researchers to adapt the current PPM techniques
  accordingly to thwart the DDoS attacks.

ABS: Diagnosis of anomalous routing states is essential for stable inter-AS (autonomous
  system) routing management, but it is difficult to perform such actions because
  inter-AS routing information changes spatially and temporally in different administrative
  domains. In particular, the route hijack problem, which is one of the major routing-management
  issues, remains difficult to analyze because of its diverse distribution dynamism.
  Although a multi-agent-based diagnostic system that can diagnose a set of routing
  anomalies by integrating the observed routing statuses among distributed agents
  has been successfully applied to real Internet service providers, the diagnostic
  accuracy depends on where those agents are located on the BGP topology map. This
  paper focuses on the AS adjacency topology of an actual network structure and analyzes
  hijacked-route behavior from the viewpoint of the connectivity of each AS. Simulation
  results using an actual Internet topology show the effectiveness of an agent-deployment
  strategy based on connectivity information.

ABS: 'Characterizing the evolution of Internet topology is important to our understanding
  of the Internet architecture and its interplay with technical, economic and social
  forces. A major challenge in obtaining empirical data on topology evolution is to
  identify real topology changes from the observed topology changes, since the latter
  can be due to either topology changes or transient routing dynamics. In this paper,
  we formulate the topology liveness problem and propose a solution based on the analysis
  of BGP data. We find that the impact of transient routing dynamics on topology observation
  decreases exponentially over time, and that the real topology dynamics consist of
  a constant-rate birth process and a constant-rate death process. Our model enables
  us to infer real topology changes from observation data with a given confidence
  level. We demonstrate the usefulness of the model by applying it to three applications:
  providing more accurate views of the topology, evaluating theoretical evolution
  models, and empirically characterizing the trends of topology evolution. We find
  that customer networks and provider networks have distinct evolution trends, which
  can provide an important input to the design of future Internet routing architecture.'

ABS: The Internet was originally designed to provide connectivity from every node
  to every other node. However, policies can impede this connectivity. This is especially
  true for newly allocated address space. Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) simply
  do not realize that the status of previously unallocated address space has changed,
  and they continue blocking that space. Therefore, it would be desirable to test
  whether filters block newly apportioned address space before it is allocated to
  ISPs and/or end users. In this paper we present a methodology that aims to detect
  incorrectly configured filters, so that ISPs can be contacted and asked to update
  their router configurations. Our methodology is capable of detecting paths on which
  reachability is actually present but which are routed around an outdated filter
  configuration, as well as cases where a destination is inaccessible. To help narrowing
  down the most likely ASs that actually filter, we introduce a filtering likelihood
  index. We apply our methodology on newly allocated address space and perform initial
  experiments on a large fraction of ISPs, covering over 80% of all Autonomous Systems
  (ASs).

ABS: Point-to-point delay is an important network performance measure as it captures
  service degradations caused by various events. We study how to measure and report
  delay in a concise and meaningful way for an ISP, and how to monitor it efficiently.
  We analyze various measurement intervals and potential metric definitions. We find
  that reporting high quantiles (between 0.95 and 0.99) every 10a30 min as the most
  effective way to summarize the delay in an ISP. We then propose an active probing
  scheme to estimate a high quantile with bounded error. We show that only a small
  number of probes are sufficient to provide an accurate estimate. We validate the
  proposed delay monitoring technique on real data collected on the Sprint IP backbone
  network. To make our work complete, we lastly compare the overhead of our active
  probing technique with a passive sampling scheme and show that for delay measurement,
  active probing is more practical.

ABS: The Internet is an extremely complex system, and it is essential that we be able
  to make accurate measurements in order to understand its underlying behavior or
  to detect improper behavior (e.g., attacks). The reality, however, is that it is
  impractical to fully instrument anything but relatively small networks and impossible
  to even partially instrument many parts of the Internet. This paper analyzes a subset
  of the general monitor placement problem where the goal is to maximize the coverage
  of the entire universe of potential communication pairs (i.e., source and destination
  are randomly distributed in the routable Internet address space). This issue arises,
  for example, when trying to detect/track a distributed attack. We present results
  from a simulation, seeded with data from skitter and RouteViews, that indicate we
  can monitor a packet with a high probability by monitoring relatively few points
  in the Internet. Our analysis suggests that the preferred strategy to place monitors
  should be to instrument one or two specific inter-AS links per AS for many ASes
  rather than deeply instrumenting a subset of the largest ASes.

ABS: Most data concerning the topology of complex networks are the result of mapping
  projects which bear intrinsic limitations and cannot give access to complete, unbiased
  datasets. A particularly interesting case is represented by the physical Internet.
  Router-level Internet mapping projects generally consist of sampling the network
  from a limited set of sources by using traceroute probes. This methodology, akin
  to the merging of spanning trees from the different sources to a set of destinations,
  leads necessarily to a partial, incomplete map of the Internet. The determination
  of the real Internet topology characteristics from such sampled maps is therefore,
  in part, a problem of statistical inference. In this paper we present a twofold
  contribution in order to address this problem. First, we argue that inference of
  some of the standard topological quantities is, in fact, a version of the so-called
  aspeciesa problem in statistics, which is important in categorizing the problem
  and providing some indication of its inherent difficulties. Second, we tackle the
  issue of estimating arguably the most basic of network characteristicsaits number
  of nodesaand propose two estimators for this quantity, based on subsampling principles.
  Numerical simulations, as well as an experiment based on probing the Internet, suggest
  the feasibility of accounting for measurement bias in reporting Internet topology
  characteristics.

ABS: We investigate the problem of finding a fast and resilient propagation topology
  and propagation schedule for worms and similar malcodes, given that the malcode
  knows a little more information about the targets than just the IP addresses. Resiliency
  means that the malcode is still able to propagate to a large expected number of
  targets even when some targets are not infectable. We first show that, under a moderately
  general network model, the problem of optimizing propagation time is NP-hard. This
  fact justifies the need for a refinement of the network model, which we present
  next. In the refined model, when all nodes are infectable we present an optimal
  propagation topology. We also show that for every preemptive schedule there exists
  a non-preemptive schedule which is just as effective. This fact greatly simplifies
  the optimization problem. With the presence of uncertainty (some targets may fail
  to be infected with some given probabilities due to network errors, security patches,
  etc.), there is a natural trade-off between the expected total infection time and
  the expected number of infected targets. We investigate this trade-off by deriving
  the optimal expected number of infected nodes and the corresponding propagation
  topology. Next, we give a propagation topology and schedule which can reduce the
  infection time significantly while keeping the expected number of infected nodes
  exponentially close to optimal. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first
  in the literature to formulate and address the aforementioned trade-off, and also
  the infection time optimization problem on a formal basis. We expect our problem
  formulations and solutions to have applications in similar application-level source
  broadcast problems, such as ones in P2P and overlay networks. Last but not least,
  our formulations leave open a number of interesting and challenging problems.

ABS: Recent surveys show that DDoS attack is still one of the major threats to the
  Internet security. Many techniques have been proposed to trace the origin of attacking
  packets, known as IP traceback problem, using either hash-based packet logging or
  probabilistic packet marking. However, both approaches have scalability problems
  under the heavy DDoS attacks in terms of the space and computational overheads.
  In this paper, we propose a novel scalable IP Traceback scheme by utilizing the
  advantage of both packet logging and marking to balance the overheads at routers
  and at the victim, hence scalable for both sides. The baseline idea of our approach
  is to sample a very small percentage (e.g., 1%) of packets at the routers, and save
  the digests of only sampled packets. At the same time, the routers mark their signature
  using very simple marking scheme into the marking field of sampled IP packets to
  send out the information of logging to the victim in probabilistic way to help the
  traceback procedure. We also propose a heuristic technique to improve the performance
  of the marking scheme. In the result, the number of attacking packets the victim
  should collect for the traceback procedure to achieve high level of traceback accuracy
  is much less than the numbers in previous PPM schemes, and also the computational
  and storage overhead in routers are much less than previous packet logging approach.

ABS: 'A practical and robust inter-domain marking scheme for IP traceback is proposed.
  We first identify six drawbacks of Probabilistic Packet Marking (PPM), and then
  contrive a synergic scheme to address all of them. To relieve the victim from the
  daunting computational overhead, we derive the optimal marking probability with
  respect to the number of packets required for path reconstruction, and explore two
  different approaches to enhance PPM. In so doing, computational burden and spoofed
  marking inscribed by the attacker are thwarted. Next, we study the issue of bogus
  marking incurred by subverted routers. By coupling the marking and routing information,
  a downstream router can examine the correctness of the marking provided by upstream
  routers, thus eliminating the spurious marking embedded by subverted routers. Our
  coarse-grained marking tactic (marking at the AS level rather than hop-by-hop) brings
  two additional benefits: our scheme can effectively suppress false positives, and
  partial deployment of our scheme may achieve the similar effect as global deployment
  in the power-law Internet. Finally, we evaluate and analyze the performance of our
  proposal on empirical Internet measurement data. Results show that as many as 90.67%
  of marked packets required for path reconstruction may be reduced on average while
  false positives are greatly suppressed and robustness is significantly enhanced.'

ABS: Researchers involved in designing network services and protocols rely on results
  from simulation and emulation environments to evaluate correctness, performance
  and scalability. To better understand the behavior of these applications and to
  predict their performance when deployed across the Internet, the generated topologies
  that serve as input to simulated and emulated environments must closely match real
  network topologies with respect to a wide range of graph metrics proposed in the
  literature. Values for a particular graph metric may capture a graphas resilience
  to failure or its routing efficiency. Unfortunately, there are typically no known
  algorithms to generate graphs matching one or more proposed metrics and there is
  little understanding of the relationships among individual metrics or their applicability
  to different settings. Furthermore, the generated topologies must also be annotated
  with observed network characteristics that, for instance, include latencies for
  the edges in a router-level graph, and AS membership for the nodes in the graph.
  Finally, it should be possible to rescale a given topology to a variety of sizes
  while still maintaining its essential characteristics. We present a new, systematic
  approach for analyzing and synthesizing network topologies. We first introduce a
  unifying series of properties, the dK-series of probability distributions, specifying
  all degree correlations within d-sized subgraphs of a given graph G. Increasing
  values of d capture progressively more properties of G and,in the limit, describes
  the graph in its entirety. Using the dK-series, we construct random graphs and demonstrate
  that these graphs reproduce, with increasing accuracy, all important metrics of
  measured and modeled Internet topologies. The nature of the dKseries implies that
  it will also capture any future metric that may be proposed. Further, we scale the
  generated graphs to a wide range of sizes while still preserving the graphas structure.
  Finally, we propose techniques to annotate these topologies and specifically describe
  our scheme to annotate Internet router graphs with AS-membership as well as whether
  a router is peering or internal.

ABS: 'The IP traceback is a reactive mechanism for finding the origin(s) of a flooding
  denial-of-service (DoS) attack. In order to defeat a DoS attack or alleviate its
  harmful effects, the IP traceback should be integrated with some complementary defense
  mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a distributed packet filtering scheme based
  on the information provided by an IP traceback mechanism. In this method, a number
  of routers, located on the attack path, filter out the packets probabilistically..
  The victim uses the information provided by the traceback mechanism to determine
  the routers that should participate in defense as well as the probability of filtering
  for each router. The method proposed in this paper differs from the existing IP
  traceback-based filtering mechanisms in two ways: the method can defeat bandwidth
  exhaustion attacks, and its filtering is only based on the packets destination addresses.
  The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method'

ABS: Currently there is very few data that can describe the whole profile of a DDoS
  attack. In this paper, the active DDoS defense system deploys a number of sub-systems,
  such as Flexible Deterministic Packet Marking (FDPM) and Mark-Aided Distributed
  Filtering (MADF). In addition, two DDoS tools, TFN2K and Trinoo, are adopted and
  integrated into SSFNet to create virtual DDoS networks to simulate the attacks.
  Then, simulation experiments are used to evaluate the performance of the active
  DDoS defense system. At last, we set up a model to describe the interactions between
  DDoS attack and defense party, which allows us to have a deep insight of the interactions
  between the attack and defense parties. Experiment results shows that the model
  can precisely estimate the defense effectiveness of the system when it encounters
  attacks.

ABS: This paper presents a family of bitmap algorithms that address the problem of
  counting the number of distinct header patterns (flows) seen on a high-speed link.
  Such counting can be used to detect DoS attacks and port scans and to solve measurement
  problems. Counting is especially hard when processing must be done within a packet
  arrival time (8 ns at OC-768 speeds) and, hence, may perform only a small number
  of accesses to limited, fast memory. A naive solution that maintains a hash table
  requires several megabytes because the number of flows can be above a million. By
  contrast, our new probabilistic algorithms use little memory and are fast. The reduction
  in memory is particularly important for applications that run multiple concurrent
  counting instances. For example, we replaced the port-scan detection component of
  the popular intrusion detection system Snort with one of our new algorithms. This
  reduced memory usage on a ten minute trace from 50 to 5.6 MB while maintaining a
  99.77% probability of alarming on a scan within 6 s of when the large-memory algorithm
  would. The best known prior algorithm (probabilistic counting) takes four times
  more memory on port scan detection and eight times more on a measurement application.
  This is possible because our algorithms can be customized to take advantage of special
  features such as a large number of instances that have very small counts or prior
  knowledge of the likely range of the count.

ABS: Ptacek and Newsham [14] showed how to evade signature detection at Intrusion
  Prevention Systems (IPS) using TCP and IP Fragmentation. These attacks are implemented
  in tools like FragRoute, and are institutionalized in IPS product tests. The classic
  defense is for the IPS to reassemble TCP and IP packets,and to consistently normalize
  the output stream. Current IPS standards require keeping state for 1 million connections.
  Both the state and processing requirements of reassembly and normalization are barriers
  to scalability for an IPS at speeds higher than 10 Gbps.In this paper, we suggest
  breaking with this paradigm using an approach we call Split-Detect. We focus on
  the simplest form of signature, an exact string match, and start by splitting the
  signature into pieces. By doing so the attacker is either forced to include at least
  one piece completely in a packet, or to display potentially abnormal behavior (e.g.,
  several small TCP fragments or out-of-order packets) that cause the attackers flow
  to be diverted to a slow path. We prove that under certain assumptions this scheme
  can detect all byte-string evasions. We also show using real traces that the processing
  and storage requirements of this scheme can be 10% of that required by a conventional
  IPS, allowing reasonable cost implementations at 20 Gbps. While the changes required
  by Split-Detect may be a barrier to adoption, this paper exposes the assumptions
  that must be changed to avoid normalization and reassembly in the fast path.

ABS: It is vital to obtain a good description of the Internet topology because structure
  fundamentally affects function. This paper reviews two recent achievements on characterising
  and modelling the Internet topology at the autonomous systems level, including a
  newly discovered structure, called the rich-club phenomenon, and one of the most
  successful Internet topology generators to date, the positive-feedback preference
  (PFP) model. The discovery of the rich-club phenomenon is significant because an
  appreciation of this hierarchy structure is essential for a proper examination of
  the global Internet properties, such as routing efficiency, network flexibility
  and robustness. The PFP model accurately reproduces the largest set of important
  topology characteristics of the Internet. The model can be used for more realistic
  simulation studies of the Internet. The model also provides novel insights into
  the underlying rules that govern the Internet evolution.

ABS: The work presented in this thesis concerns different aspects of dynamical processes
  on networks. The first subject considered is the theoretical modeling of exploration
  processes of complex networks, such as the traceroute process used to map the Internet.
  Our mean-field analysis of the traceroute model provides a better understanding
  of the Internet topology. A second part of the thesis is devoted to the study of
  the weighted representation of networks and their relations with the functional
  properties of infrastructure systems (e.g. the airports network). Other results
  concerning spreading processes and percolation on weighted networks are presented.
  Finally, we turns to social networks, introducing the Naming Game, a model for the
  emergence of a communication system in a structured population of individuals. We
  show that the dynamical phenomena generated by this model depend strongly on the
  topology of the interactions.

ABS: Multihoming has been used by stub networks for several years as a form of redundancy,
  improving the availability of Internet access. More recently, Intelligent Route
  Control (IRC) products allow multihomed networks to dynamically switch parts of
  their egress or ingress traffic between ISPs, also improving cost and performance.
  IRC products assume that the set of upstream ISPs is given and fixed. Typically,
  however, a multihomed network has several ISP choices and the actual selection of
  ISPs can significantly affect cost, availability, and performance. In the first
  part of this work, we develop a methodology to select the best set of upstream ISPs,
  optimizing monetary cost and availability. Our results, based on measurements of
  actual Internet traffic and topology, show that the proposed algorithm selects the
  best possible set of ISPs in terms of resiliency to inter-AS single-link failures.
  The algorithm also performs well in the presence of double or triple link failures.
  In the second part of this work, we focus on the egress path selection problem.
  Specifically, we propose a stochastic search algorithm, based on simulated annealing,
  to allocate the networkas egress traffic between upstream ISPs. The objectives are
  to minimize cost, also ensuring that the selected paths to the major destinations
  of egress traffic are congestion-free. Simulation results show that the proposed
  algorithm performs very well in meeting the previous objectives, when congestion-free
  paths exist.

ABS: Overlay networks are being increasingly used to deploy new services on the Internet.
  As opposed to peer-to-peer overlays, these infrastructure or service overlays offer
  the opportunity of placing the overlay nodes and selecting the links between them.
  There has been very little work done in the area of node placement in overlay network
  design. In this work, our objective is to study the overlay node placement problem
  based on a specific performance objective, namely, overlay link resiliency. An overlay
  link is called resilient if there exists an intermediate overlay node through which
  a connection can be established even if there is a failure in the underlying network
  links between the overlay nodes. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, called
  RouteSeer, to solve the overlay node placement problem. We split the problem into
  two parts, placing some overlay nodes called client proxies aclosea to the clients
  of the overlay service and placing intermediate nodes to provide resilient paths
  between the client proxies. RouteSeer heuristically places the intermediate overlay
  nodes by only examining the routing tables at the client proxies and does not require
  global topology information. In our simulations and experiments on the Internet,
  we show that RouteSeer can improve on previous schemes by 50-100%.

ABS: Internet is one of the most impressive creatures of our civilization; it has
  literally changed the ways we do business, communication, education, entertainment,
  and many other activities today. For example, one can conveniently contact friends
  by email and even video conversation based on the Internet. You may wonder how the
  Internet delivers emails from one end to the other end, and how the Internet makes
  a connection between two computers at the ends? When you are searching some useful
  information through the Internet by using a search engine such as Google, have you
  thought of how it works? When the so-called Worm virus spreads throughout the Internet,
  have you ever thought of how a virus propagates from a few end-hosts to the entire
  huge network? Technically, all these problems rely on the Internet route protocols,
  searching algorithms, etc., and the virus spreading depends heavily on the Internet
  topology.

ABS: 'The lack of an accurate model of the Internet topology at the Autonomous System
  (AS) level is a limiting factor in many design, simulation, and modeling efforts.
  In this paper, we tackle this problem and provide two main contributions: (a) we
  develop methodologies and tools to identify missing AS links, and (b) we quantify
  the effect of the new links on the Internet topology model. First, we conduct a
  large-scale comprehensive synthesis of most available sources of information. We
  cross-validate and compare BGP routing tables, Internet Routing Registries, and
  traceroute data, while we extract significant new information from the less-studied
  Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). We identify 40% more edges and approximately 300%
  more peer-to-peer edges compared to commonly used datasets. Second, we identify
  patterns of the new edges and quantify their effect on important topological properties.
  Given the new peer-to-peer edges, we find that for some ASes more than 50% of their
  paths stop going through their ISP providers assuming No Valley Customer Prefer
  routing. A surprisingly observation is that the degree of a node may not be a good
  ajudgea of which ASes it will peer with: the two degrees differ by a factor of four
  or more in 50% of the peer-to-peer links. Finally, we attempt to provide estimates
  of how many more edges we may be missing.'

ABS: Denial of Service attacks have become one of the most serious threats to the
  Internet community. An effective means to defend against such attacks is to locate
  the attack source(s) and to isolate it from the rest of the network. This paper
  proposes an adaptive packet marking scheme for IP traceback, which supports two
  types of marking, namely source router id marking and domain id marking. For each
  packet traversing, we let the border routers perform probabilistic router id marking
  if this packet enters the network for the first time, or perform probabilistic domain
  id marking if the packet is forwarded from another domain. After collecting sufficient
  packets, the victim reconstructs the attack graph, by which we keep track of the
  intermediate domains traversed by attack packets instead of individual routers within
  a domain; however, the source routers serving as ingress points of attack traffic
  are identified at the same time. Simulation results show that the proposed marking
  scheme outperforms other IP traceback methods as it requires fewer packets for attack
  paths reconstruction, and can handle large number of attack sources effectively;
  and the false positives produced are significantly low. Further, it does not generate
  additional traffic.

  two tasks: immediately detect the attack and take measurements to stop the upcoming
  flood. Currently deployed defense mechanisms can easily be defeated by the attackers
  because they know the weaknesses in the systems. Yaar [1] proposed Pi marking scheme
  using the 16 bit IP header identification field. The performance of Pi marking is
  not effective because of static 1 bit or 2 bit marking criteria. Our technique decides
  the packet marking dynamically on the bases of number of hop counts. The performance
  is promising as compared to other existing schemes.'

GEOLOC: Wuerzburg, DE
ABS: The algorithms and methods of the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology are often applied
  to networks and services with a demand for scalability. In contrast to traditional
  client/server architectures, an arbitrary large number of users, called peers, may
  participate in the network and use the service without losing any performance. In
  order to evaluate quantitatively and qualitatively such P2P services and their corresponding
  networks, different possibilities like analytical approaches or simulative techniques
  can be used to improve the implementation of a simulation in general. This task
  is even more important for large scale P2P networks due to the number of peers,
  the state space of the P2P network, and the interactions and relationships between
  peers and states. The goal of this work is to show how large scale P2P networks
  can be efficiently evaluated. Methods are demonstrated how to avoid problems occurring
  in simulations of P2P services. Efficient data structures are required to deal with
  a large number of events, e.g. the application of a calendar queue for the simulation
  of a Kademlia-based P2P network, or the priority queue management to simulate eDonkey
  networks. In order to speed up computational time the simulation has to be implemented
  in an efficient way, asking for sophisticated programming. This can be achieved
  for example by using parallel simulation techniques which utilize the distribution
  and autonomy of the peers in the network. Appropriate levels of abstraction and
  models for different application scenarios also improve the computational time for
  simulations of large scale P2P networks. An example is the simulation of throughput
  and round trip times in networks. We investigate a BitTorrent network on packet
  level, thereby, all details on the different layers are taken into account enabling
  us to study cross-layer interactions.Next, we take a look on P2P network for signalling
  in voice/video over IP systems. In this context, the round trip time is crucial
  for the performance of the system. The packet layer and its most important characteristics
  are modeled in order to decrease memory consumption and computational power. Finally,
  an eDonkey network in a mobile telecommunication system is investigated. In that
  case we can neglect simulating packets and instead use a stream oriented approach
  for modeling the transmission of data.

ABS: The demands of Internet applications have grown significantly in terms of required
  resources and types of services. Overlay networks have emerged to accommodate such
  applications by implementing more services on top of IP (Internet Protocol). However,
  while overlay networks are successful in circumventing limitations of IP, the task
  of building and maintaining an overlay network is still challenging. In an overlay
  network, participating hosts are virtually fully-connected through the underlying
  Internet. However, since the quality of overlay connections varies, the performance
  of the overlay network is dependent on which connections are chosen to be utilized.
  Therefore, maintaining a agooda overlay network topology is crucial in achieving
  high performance.

ABS: Internet traffic exhibits multifaceted burstiness and correlation structure over
  a wide span of time scales. Previous work analyzed this structure in terms of heavy-tailed
  session characteristics, as well as TCP timeouts and congestion avoidance, in relatively
  long time scales. We focus on shorter scales, typically less than 100-1000 milliseconds.
  Our objective is to identify the actual mechanisms that are responsible for creating
  bursty traffic in those scales. We show that TCP self-clocking, joint with queueing
  in the network, can shape the packet interarrivals of a TCP connection in a two-level
  ON-OFF pattern. This structure creates strong correlations and burstiness in time
  scales that extend up to the Round-Trip Time (RTT) of the connection. This effect
  is more important for bulk transfers that have a large bandwidth-delay product relative
  to their window size. Also, the aggregation of many flows, without rescaling their
  packet interarrivals, does not converge to a Poisson stream, as one might expect
  from classical superposition results. Instead, the burstiness in those scales can
  be significantly reduced by TCP pacing. In particular, we focus on the importance
  of the minimum pacing timer, and show that a 10-millisecond timer would be too coarse
  for removing short-scale traffic burstiness, while a 1-millisecond timer would be
  sufficient to make the traffic almost as smooth as a Poisson stream in sub-RTT scales.

ABS: The discovery of long-range dependence (a kind of asymptotic fractal scaling)
  in packet data from LANs and WANs, was followed by further work detailing evidence
  for multifractal behaviour in TCP/IP traffic in WANs. In terms of networking however,
  physical mechanisms for such behaviour have never been convincingly demonstrated,
  leaving open the question of whether multifractal traffic models are of black box
  type, or alternatively if there is anything real behind them. In this paper we review
  the evidence for multifractal behaviour of aggregate TCP traffic, and show that
  in many ways it is weak. Our study includes classic traces and very recent ones.
  We point out misunderstandings in the literature concerning the scales over which
  multifractality has been claimed. We explain other pitfalls which have led to the
  multifractal case being overstated, in particular the possibility of pseudo scaling
  being confused with true scaling, due to shortcomings in the statistical tools.
  We argue for an alternative point process model with strong physical meaning. It
  reproduces the higher order statistics of the data well, despite not being calibrated
  for them, yet is not multifractal. From its standpoint, the empirical multifractal
  behaviour is seen as a misinterpretation due to a lack of power in the statistical
  methodology.

ABS: There is a growing interest in discovery of internet topology at the interface
  level. A new generation of highly distributed measurement systems is currently being
  deployed. Unfortunately, the research community has not examined the problem of
  how to perform such measurements efficiently and in a network-friendly manner. In
  this paper we make two contributions toward that end. First, we show that standard
  topology discovery methods (e.g., skitter) are quite inefficient, repeatedly probing
  the same interfaces. This is a concern, because when scaled up, such methods will
  generate so much traffic that they will begin to resemble DDoS attacks. We measure
  two kinds of redundancy in probing (intra- and inter-monitor) and show that both
  kinds are important. We show that straightforward approaches to addressing these
  two kinds of redundancy must take opposite tacks, and are thus fundamentally in
  conflict. Our second contribution is to propose and evaluate Doubletree, an algorithm
  that reduces both types of redundancy simultaneously on routers and end systems.
  The key ideas are to exploit the tree-like structure of routes to and from a single
  point in order to guide when to stop probing, and to probe each path by starting
  near its midpoint. Our results show that Doubletree can reduce both types of measurement
  load on the network dramatically, while permitting discovery of nearly the same
  set of nodes and links.

ABS: Analysis of security attacks shows that an attack leaves its imprint or signature
  in the attack packets. Traffic from Distributed Denial of Service attacks and rapid
  worm spreads has the potential to yield signatures. While all signatures may not
  be indicative of attacks, it is useful to extract non-transient signatures that
  are carried by a sufficient number of flows/packets/bytes. The number of packets/bytes
  in the flows carrying the signature may be used for rate-limiting the flows, providing
  for timely and automated response to both known and unknown attacks. This paper
  proposes an efficient algorithm, PISA, which clusters flows based on similarity
  in packet information and extracts signatures from high-bandwidth clusters. Extensive
  experiments on two weeks of real attack data of 100 million packets yield about
  1744 signatures. Additionally, PISA extracted the signature for the Blaster worm
  connection attempts in a mix of traffic from a trans-Pacific backbone link.

ABS: Recently, a first step towards a highly distributed IP-level topology discovery
  tool has been made with the introduction of the Doubletree algorithm. Doubletree
  is an efficient cooperative algorithm that allows the discovery of a large portion
  of nodes and links in the network while strongly reducing probing redundancy on
  nodes and destinations as well as the amount of probes sent. In this paper, we propose
  to reduce more strongly the load on destinations and, more essentially, the communication
  cost required for the cooperation by introducing a probing stop rule based on CIDR

ABS: Discovering the properties of the Internet topology is crucial for the use, maintenance
  and optimization of the Internet. A recent approach in the research community is
  to collect IP path data from active probing of hosts and to map the IP paths to
  known Autonomous System (AS) paths. We apply the MULICsoft clustering algorithm
  to network data for ASs forming the Internet backbones. MULICsoft is intended for
  categorical data sets where each categorical attribute value (CA) has a weight in
  the range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating how strongly the corresponding CA should influence
  the clustering process. MULICsoft produces as many clusters as it can find in the
  data set. Each cluster consists of layers formed gradually through iterations, by
  reducing the similarity criterion for inserting objects in layers of a cluster at
  different iterations. The objects in the data are ASs and the CAs represent links
  between ASs. The weights are inversely related to the number of unknown IPs in an
  indirect link between ASs. We introduce a novel significance metric for identifying
  the most significant ASs in a cluster.

ABS: A novel cache-based packet-processing-engine (PPE) architecture that achieves
  low-power consumption and high packet-processing throughput by exploiting the nature
  of network traffic is proposed. This architecture consists of a processing-unit
  array and a bit-stream manipulation path called a burst stream path (BSP) that has
  a special cache mechanism called a process-learning cache (PLC). Network packets,
  which have the same information in their header, appear repeatedly over a short
  time. By exploiting that nature, the PLC memorizes the packet-processing method
  with all results (i. e. , table lookups), and applies it to other packets. The PLC
  enables most packets to skip the execution at the processing-unit array, which consumes
  high power. As a practical implementation of the cache-based PPE architecture, P-Gear
  was designed. In particular, P-Gear was compared with a conventional PPE in terms
  of silicon die size and power consumption. According to this comparison, in the
  case of current 0.13-microm CMOS process technology, P-Gear can achieve 100-Gbps
  (gigabit per second) packet-processing throughput with only 36.5% of the die size
  and 32.8% of the power consumption required by the conventional PPE. Configurations
  of both architectures for the 1- to 100-Gbps throughput range were also analyzed.
  In the throughput range of 10-Gbps or more, P-Gear can achieve the target throughput
  in a smaller die size than the conventional PPE. And for the whole throughput range,
  P-Gear can achieve a target throughput at lower power than the conventional PPE.

ABS: 'Traceback mechanisms are a critical part of the defense against IP spoofing
  and DoS attacks, as well as being of forensic value to law enforcement. Currently
  proposed IP traceback mechanisms are inadequate to address the traceback problem
  for the following reasons: they require DDoS victims to gather thousands of packets
  to reconstruct a single attack path; they do not scale to large scale distributed
  DoS attacks; and they do not support incremental deployment. We propose fast Internet
  traceback (FIT), a new packet marking approach that significantly improves IP traceback
  in several dimensions: (1) victims can identify attack paths with high probability
  after receiving only tens of packets, a reduction of 1-3 orders of magnitude compared
  to previous packet marking schemes; (2) FIT performs well even in the presence of
  legacy routers, allowing every FIT-enabled router in path to be identified; and
  (3) FIT scales to large distributed attacks with thousands of attackers. Compared
  with previous packet marking schemes, FIT represents a step forward in performance
  and deployability.'

ABS: Topology discovery systems are starting to be introduced in the form of easily
  and widely deployed software. However, little consideration has been given as to
  how to perform large-scale topology discovery efficiently and in a network-friendly
  manner. In prior work, we have described how large numbers of traceroute monitors
  can coordinate their efforts to map the network while reducing their impact on routers
  and end-systems. The key is for them to share information regarding the paths they
  have explored. However, such sharing introduces considerable communication overhead.
  Here, we show how to improve the communication scaling properties through the use
  of Bloom filters to encode a probing stop set. Also, any system in which every monitor
  traces routes towards every destination has inherent scaling problems. We propose
  capping the number of monitors per destination, and dividing the monitors into clusters,
  each cluster focusing on a different destination list.

ABS: Cartograms are a well-known technique for showing geography-related statistical
  information, such as demographic and epidemiological data. The idea is to distort
  a map by resizing its regions according to a statistical parameter, but in a way
  that keeps the map recognizable. In this thesis, we formally define a family of
  cartogram drawing problems. We show that even simple variants are unsolvable in
  the general case. Furthermore, we propose two methods of cartogram generation. Both
  algorithms cover a wide range of user requirements which can be directly maintained
  by the user. The first algorithm strictly retains the topology and shape of the
  map regions while minimizing the area error. The second algorithm approximates the
  map regions by rectangles focusing on an exact area approach and minimizing shape,
  topology and relative position of the map regions. Both algorithms are fast enough
  to be used in interactive systems which is important to be used as information visualization
  technique. Application experiments show that the proposed algorithms can compute
  high-quality cartograms in few seconds, even for large maps with a high number of
  polygons. Also, our algorithms were designed for a dynamic visualization, for which
  we need an algorithm that recalculates a cartogram in a few seconds. None of the
  algorithms published before provides an adequate performance with an acceptable
  level of quality for this application. Additional application examples of the two
  new algorithms introduced in this work help to demonstrate their potential.

ABS: Nowadays Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have made one of the most
  serious threats to the information infrastructure. In this paper we firstly present
  a new filtering approach, Mark-Aided Distributed Filtering (MADF), which is to find
  the network anomalies by using a back-propagation neural network, deploy the defense
  system at distributed routers, identify and filtering the attack packets before
  they can reach the victim; and secondly propose an analytical model for the interactions
  between DDoS attack party and defense party, which allows us to have a deep insight
  of the interactions between the attack and defense parties. According to the experimental
  results, we find that MADF can detect and filter DDoS attack packets with high sensitivity
  and accuracy, thus provide high legitimate traffic throughput and low attack traffic
  throughput. Through the comparison between experiments and numerical results, we
  also demonstrate the validity of the analytical model that can precisely estimate
  the effectiveness of a DDoS defense system before it encounters different attacks.

ABS: The use of Internet has revolutionized the way information is exchanged, changed
  business paradigms and put mission critical and sensitive systems online. Any disruption
  of this connectivity and the plethora of services provided results in significant
  damages to everyone involved. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are becoming increasingly
  common and are the cause of lost time and revenue. Flooding type DoS attacks use
  spoofed IP addresses to disguise the attackers. This makes identification of the
  attackers extremely difficult. This work proposes a new scheme that allows the victim
  of a DoS attack to identify the correct origin of the malicious traffic. The suggested
  mechanism requires routers to mark packets using adjusted probabilistic marking.
  This results in a lower number of packet-markings required to identify the traffic
  source. Unlike many related works, we use the existing IPv4 header structure to
  incorporate these markings. We simulate and test our algorithms using real Internet
  trace data to show that our technique is fast, and works successfully for a large
  number of distributed attackers.

ABS: We present congestion puzzles (CP), a new countermeasure to bandwidth-exhaustion
  attacks. Like other defenses based on client puzzles, CP attempts to force attackers
  to invest vast resources in order to effectively perform denial of-service attacks.
  Unlike previous puzzle-based approaches, however, ours is the first designed for
  the bandwidth-exhaustion attacks that are common at the network (IP) layer. At the
  core of CP is an elegant distributed puzzle mechanism that permits routers to cooperatively
  impose and check puzzles. We demonstrate through analysis and simulation that CP
  can effectively defend networks from flooding attacks without relying on the formulation
  of attack signatures to filter traffic. Moreover, as many such attacks are conducted
  by azombiea computers that have been silently commandeered without the knowledge
  of their owners, the overheads that CP imposes on heavily engaged zombies can increase
  the likelihood that the computeras owner detects the compromise and takes action
  to remedy it.

ABS: Accurate, reliable timestamping which is also convenient and inexpensive is needed
  in many important areas including real-time network applications and network measurement.
  Recently the TSC register, which counts CPU cycles in popular PC architectures,
  was proposed as the basis of a new software clock which in terms of rate performance
  performs as well as more expensive GPS alternatives. Smooth and precise clock rate
  is essential to measure time differences accurately. We show how to define a TSC
  based clock which is also accurate with respect to absolute time. The clock is calibrated
  by processing, in a novel way, timestamps contained in the usual flow of Network
  Time Protocol (NTP) packets between a NTP server and the existing software clock,
  and TSC timestamps made independently on the host side. Using real measurements
  over 4 months, validated with a GPS synchronized hardware timing solution, the algorithm
  measured absolute time with a median error of only 30 microseconds when using a
  nearby stratum-1 NTP server. Results for two other servers are given. We also provide
  new algorithms for the robust determination of clock rate. We exploit the reliability
  of the available hardware to design synchronization algorithms which are inherently
  robust to many factors including packet loss, server outages, route changes, temperature
  environment, and network congestion.

  its parameters unambiguously. The authors outline LRD findings in network traffic
  and explore the current lack of accuracy and robustness in LRD estimation. In addition,
  they present recent evidence that packet arrivals appear to be in agreement with

  receives traffic (static clustering and network-aware clustering), and two based
  on coarse indications of the path each packet traverses (hop-count filtering and
  path identifiers). Our analysis reveals challenges facing the proposed techniques
  in practice, and the implications of these issues for effective filtering. In addition,
  we compare techniques on equal footing, by evaluating the performance of one scheme
  under assumptions made by another. We conclude with an interpretation of the results

ABS: Internet coordinate systems appear promising as a method for estimating network
  distance without direct measurement, allowing scalable configuration of emerging
  applications such as content delivery networks, peer to peer systems, and overlay
  networks. However all such systems rely on landmarks, and the choice of landmarks
  has a dramatic impact on their accuracy. Landmark selection is challenging because
  of the size of the Internet (leading to an immense space of candidate sets) and
  because insight into the properties of good landmark sets is lacking. In this paper
  we explore fast algorithms for landmark selection. Whereas the traditional approach
  to analyzing similar network-based configurkation problems employs the graph structure
  of the Internet, we leverage work in coordinate systems to treat the problem geometrically,
  providing an opening for applying new algorithms. Our results suggest that when
  employing small numbers of landmarks (5-10), such geometric algorithms provide good
  landmarks, while for larger numbers of landmarks (20-30) even faster methods based
  on random selection are equally effective.

ABS: One of the fundamental limitations of the Internet is the inability of a packet
  flow recipient to halt disruptive flows before they consume the recipients network
  link resources. Critical infrastructures and businesses alike are vulnerable to
  DoS attacks or flash-crowds that can incapacitate their networks with traffic floods.
  Unfortunately, current mechanisms require per-flow state at routers, ISP collaboration,
  or the deployment of an overlay infrastructure to defend against these events. In
  this paper, we present SIFF, a Stateless Internet Flow Filter, which allows an end-host
  to selectively stop individual flows from reaching its network, without any of the
  common assumptions listed above. We divide all network traffic into two classes,
  privileged (prioritized packets subject to recipient control) and unprivileged (legacy
  traffic). Privileged channels are established through a capability exchange handshake.
  Capabilities are dynamic and verified statelessly by the routers in the network,
  and can be revoked by quenching update messages to an offending host. SIFF is transparent
  to legacy clients and servers, but only updated hosts will enjoy the benefits of
  it.

ABS: Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) are one of two primary methods for Autonomous
  Systems (ASes) to interconnect with each other for exchanging traffic and for global
  Internet reachability. This paper explores the properties of IXPs and their impact
  on the AS topology and AS business relations using Scriptroute and Skitter traceroute
  probes, BGP routing archives and other data. With these datasets we develop an algorithm
  to discover IXPs and infer ASes that participate at these IXPs. Using the discovered
  IXPs and their inferred AS participants, we analyze and characterize the properties
  of IXPs and their participants such as size, geographical locations. We also investigate
  the impact of IXPs on the global AS topology and business relations between ASes.
  Our study sheds light on the Internet interconnection practices and the evolution
  of the Internet, in particular, the potential role IXPs play in such evolution.

ABS: Peering allows service providers to handle traffic surges without over-provisioning,
  reduce the cost of dedicated infrastructure, and leverage the specialization and
  prices of partner providers. We develop a peering system for multi-provider content
  delivery based on a cost-optimized peer selection algorithm. We formulate a cost
  model for evaluating competing peering strategies, and use measurement data collected
  from globally distributed network probe stations, large-scale Web sites, and existing
  service provider infrastructures to empirically evaluate proposed peering strategies.
  Our analysis shows that our peer selection algorithm is significantly more efficient
  than greedy alternatives, in terms of minimizing service cost and respecting network
  delay and server capacity thresholds, over a broad range of real-world scenarios.

ABS: Through the desire of understanding the Internet better, we focused our attention
  on the modelling of the way data move in the Internet. Our main goal here was to
  give ideas on what does a route followed by packets look like. In most of the simulations,
  researchers model routes by shortest paths, we try to provide more realistic models
  to improve simulations accuracy out of concern for keeping it relatively simple.
  To achieve this study, we used the data from the Skitter network measurement platform
  that runs about thirty monitors which probe tens of thousands destinations per day
  around the world in order to collect routes packets have followed with the path
  forwarding method. It is the largest known effort of route collection and also a
  mean to get a realistic topology of the Internet. With the help of the Skitter data
  we pointed out lots of global and local routes characteristics and we have designed
  some algorithms to generate fake routes that fit the properties observed.

ABS: Network Processors (NPs) are used for network communication devices such as routers
  to flexibly process network traffic at high speed. Many NPs use the techniques of
  pipelining and simultaneously processing to obtain up to 10-Gbps to 40-Gbps packet
  processing throughput. Utilizing the temporal locality of network traffic, we propose
  a novel NP architecture that accelerates packet-processing throughput by using a
  cache called header-learning cache (HLC) and cache-miss handler (CMH). A functional
  level simulator with real traffic traces showed 88% or higher HLC hit-rate at the
  backbone router of the access network. This architecture could accelerate 20-Gbps
  packet processing engines up to about five times and achieve 100-Gbps throughput.

ABS: This paper investigates a design for a new form of interactivity with information
  projected onto a spherical surface. This form of interaction is related to the direct
  rotation of the spherical surface itself. Traditional methods of computer interaction
  use a representative format, such as the movement of a mouse representing the motion
  of a cursor on a flat screen. This representative interaction often becomes less
  obvious with a three dimensional object, as there is often an exact view position
  required. The rotational interaction method developed provides a more direct physical
  connection with the data interaction upon a sphere by mimicking globe style rotational
  interaction. The authors discuss in detail the design and implementation of the
  rotation interactivity, including a discussion of the limitations involved.

ABS: 'Recent work has shown that the physical connectivity of the Internet exhibits
  small-world behavior. Characterizing such behavior is important not only for generating
  realistic Internet topologies, but also for the proper evaluation of network algorithms
  and protocols. Along this line, this paper tries to answer how small-world behavior
  arises in the Internet topologies and how it impacts the performance of multicast
  techniques. First, we attribute small-world behavior to two possible causes: the
  variability of vertex degree and the preference of vertices to have local connections.
  We found that both factors contribute with different relative degrees to the small-world
  behavior of the AS-level and router-level Internet topologies. For the AS-level
  topology, we have observed that extremely high variability of vertex degree is sufficient
  to cause small-world behavior, but for the router-level topology, preference for
  local connectivity plays a more important role. Second, we propose simple models
  to generate more realistic small-world Internet topologies. Our models consider
  both causes of small-world behavior. Third, we demonstrate the significance of our
  work by studying the scaling behavior of IP multicast tree size. We show that if
  topology generators capture only the variability of vertex degree, they are likely
  to underestimate the efficacy of multicast techniques.'

ABS: 'Internet coordinate schemes have been proposed as a method for estimating minimum

  desired estimate. Two key questions are: How accurate are coordinate schemes across
  the Internet as a whole? And: are coordinate assignment schemes fast enough, and
  scalable enough, for large scale use? In this paper we make contributions toward
  answering both those questions. Whereas the coordinate assignment problem has in
  the past been approached by nonlinear optimization, we develop a faster method based
  on dimensionality reduction of the Lipschitz embedding. We show that this method

GEOLOC: San Diego, CA, US
ABS: This paper presents a family of bitmap algorithms that address the problem of
  counting the number of distinct header patterns (flows) seen on a high speed link.
  Such counting can be used to detect DoS attacks and port scans, and to solve measurement
  problems. Counting is especially hard when processing must be done within a packet
  arrival time (8 nsec at OC-768 speeds) and, hence, must require only a small number
  of accesses to limited, fast memory. A naive solution that maintains a hash table
  requires several Mbytes because the number of flows can be above a million. By contrast,
  our new probabilistic algorithms take very little memory and are fast. The reduction
  in memory is particularly important for applications that run multiple concurrent
  counting instances. For example, we replaced the port scan detection component of
  the popular intrusion detection system Snort with one of our new algorithms. This
  reduced memory usage on a ten minute trace from 50 Mbytes to 5.6 Mbytes while maintaining
  a 99.77% probability of alarming on a scan within 6 seconds of when the large-memory
  algorithm would. The best known prior algorithm (probabilistic counting) takes 4
  times more memory on port scan detection and 8 times more on a measurement application.
  Fundamentally, this is because our algorithms can be customized to take advantage
  of special features of applications such as a large number of instances that have
  very small counts or prior knowledge of the likely range of the count.

GEOLOC: Atlanta, GA, US
ABS: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the most difficult security problems
  to address. While many existing techniques (e.g., IP traceback) focus on tracking
  the location of the attackers after-the-fact, little is done to mitigate the effect
  of an attack while it is raging on. We present a novel technique that can effectively
  filter out the majority of DDoS traffic, thus improving the overall throughput of
  the legitimate traffic. The proposed scheme leverages on and generalizes the IP
  traceback schemes to obtain the information concerning whether a network edge is
  on the attacking path of an attacker (infected) or not (clean). We observe that,
  while an attacker will have all the edges on its path marked as infected, edges
  on the path of a legitimate client will mostly be clean. By preferentially filtering
  out packets that are inscribed with the marks of infected edges, the proposed scheme
  removes most of the DDoS traffic while affecting legitimate traffic only slightly.
  Simulation results based on real-world network topologies all demonstrate that the
  proposed technique can improve the throughput of legitimate traffic by three to
  seven times during DDoS attacks.

ABS: The various proposed DHT routing algorithms embody several different underlying
  routing geometries. These geometries include hypercubes, rings, tree-like structures,
  and butterfly networks. In this paper we focus on how these basic geometric approaches
  affect the resilience and proximity properties of DHTs. One factor that distinguishes
  these geometries is the degree of flexibility they provide in the selection of neighbors
  and routes. Flexibility is an important factor in achieving good static resilience
  and effective proximity neighbor and route selection. Our basic finding is that,
  despite our initial preference for more complex geometries, the ring geometry allows
  the greatest flexibility, and hence achieves the best resilience and proximity performance.

ABS: 'Accurate network traffic measurement is required for accounting, bandwidth provisioning
  and detecting DoS attacks. These applications see the traffic as a collection of
  flows they need to measure. As link speeds and the number of flows increase, keeping
  a counter for each flow is too expensive (using SRAM) or slow (using DRAM). The
  current state-of-the-art methods (Ciscos sampled NetFlow), which count periodically
  sampled packets are slow, inaccurate and resource-intensive. Previous work showed
  that at different granularities a small number of heavy hitters accounts for a large
  share of traffic. Our paper introduces a paradigm shift by concentrating the measurement
  process on large flows only - those above some threshold such as 0.1% of the link
  capacity. We propose two novel and scalable algorithms for identifying the large
  flows: sample and hold and multistage filters, which take a constant number of memory
  references per packet and use a small amount of memory. If M is the available memory,
  we show analytically that the errors of our new algorithms are proportional to 1/M;
  by contrast, the error of an algorithm based on classical sampling is proportional
  to 1/sqrt M, thus providing much less accuracy for the same amount of memory. We
  also describe optimizations such as early removal and conservative update that further
  improve the accuracy of our algorithms, as measured on real traffic traces, by an
  order of magnitude. Our schemes allow a new form of accounting called threshold
  accounting in which only flows above a threshold are charged by usage while the
  rest are charged a fixed fee. Threshold accounting generalizes usage-based and duration
  based pricing.'

ABS: 'One relatively unexplored question about the Internets physical structure concerns
  the geographical location of its components: routers, links, and autonomous systems
  (ASes). We study this question using two large inventories of Internet routers and
  links, collected by different methods and about two years apart. We first map each
  router to its geographical location using two different state-of-the-art tools.
  We then study the relationship between router location and population density; between
  geographic distance and link density; and between the size and geographic extent
  of ASes. Our findings are consistent across the two datasets and both mapping methods.
  First, as expected, router density per person varies widely over different economic
  regions; however, in economically homogeneous regions, router density shows a strong
  superlinear relationship to population density. Second, the probability that two
  routers are directly connected is strongly dependent on distance; our data is consistent
  with a model in which a majority (up to 75%-95%) of link formation is based on geographical
  distance (as in the Waxman topology generation method). Finally, we find that ASes
  show high variability in geographic size, which is correlated with other measures
  of AS size (degree and number of interfaces). Among small to medium ASes, ASes show
  wide variability in their geographic dispersal; however, all ASes exceeding a certain
  threshold in size are maximally dispersed geographically. These findings have many
  implications for the next generation of topology generators, which we envisage as
  producing router-level graphs annotated with attributes such as link latencies,
  AS identifiers, and geographical locations.'

  challenging. This paper describes a newmethod of trafficcharacterization thatautomatically
  groupstrafficinto minimal clusters of conspicuous consumption. Rather than providing
  a static analysis specialized to capture flows, applications, or network-to-network
  traffic matrices, our approach dynamically produces hybrid traffic definitions that
  match the underlying usage. For example, rather than report five hundred small flows,
  or the amount of TCP traffic to port 80, or the top ten hosts, our method might
  reveal that a certain percent of traffic was used by TCP connections between AOL
  clients and a particular group of Web servers. Similarly, our technique can be used
  to automatically classify new traffic patterns, such as network worms or peer-to-peer
  applications, without knowing the structure of such traffic a priori. We describe
  a series of algorithms for constructing these traffic clusters and minimizing their
  representation. In addition, we describe the design of our prototype system, AutoFocus
  and our experiences using it to discover the dominant and unusual modes of usage

  Defense against these attacks is complicated by spoofed source IP addresses, which

  Identifier), a new packet marking approach in which a path fingerprint is embedded
  in each packet, enabling a victim to identify packets traversing the same paths
  through the Internet on a per packet basis, regardless of source IP address spoofing.
  Pi features many unique properties. It is a per-packet deterministic mechanism:
  each packet traveling along the same path carries the same identifier. This allows
  the victim to take a proactive role in defending against a DDoS attack by using
  the Pi mark to filter out packets matching the attackers identifiers on a per packet
  basis. The Pi scheme performs well under large-scale DDoS attacks consisting of
  thousands of attackers, and is effective even when only half the routers in the
  Internet participate in packet marking. Pi marking and filtering are both extremely
  light-weight and require negligible state. We use traceroute maps of real Internet

ABS: 'Recent studies observe that vertex degree in the autonomous systems (AS) graph
  exhibits a highly variable distribution [14, 21]. The most prominent explanatory

  of the B-A model is preferential connectivity --- meaning that the likelihood a
  new node in a growing graph will connect to an existing node is proportional to
  the existing nodes degree. In this paper we ask whether a more general explanation

  with empirical data. We are motivated by two observations: first, AS degree and
  AS size are highly correlated [10]; and second, highly variable AS size can arise
  simply through exponential growth. We construct a model incorporating exponential
  growth in the size of the Internet and in the number of ASes, and show that it yields
  a size distribution exhibiting a power-law tail. In such a model, if an ASs link
  formation is roughly proportional to its size, then AS out-degree will also show
  high variability. Moreover, our approach is more flexible than previous work, since
  the choice of which AS to connect to does not impact high variability, thus can
  be freely specified. We instantiate such a model with empirically derived estimates
  of historical growth rates and show that the resulting degree distribution is in
  good agreement with that of real AS graphs.'

ABS: Correctly mapping Autonomous Systems (ASes) to their owner organizations is critical
  for connecting AS-level and organization-level research. Unfortunately, constructing
  an accurate dataset of AS-to-organization mappings is difficult due to a lack of
  ground truth information. CAIDA AS-to-organization (CA2O), the current state-of-the-art
  dataset, relies heavily on Whois databases maintained by Regional Internet Registries
  (RIRs) to infer the AS-to-organization mappings. However, inaccuracies in Whois
  data can dramatically impact the accuracy of CA2O, particularly for inferences involving
  ASes owned by the same organization (referred to as sibling ASes). In this work,
  we leverage PeeringDB (PDB) as an additional data source to detect potential errors
  of sibling relations in CA2O. By conducting a meticulous semi-manual investigation,
  we discover two pitfalls of using Whois data that result in incorrect inferences
  in CA2O. We then systematically analyze how these pitfalls influence CA2O. We also
  build an improved dataset on sibling relations, which corrects the mappings of 12.5%
  of CA2O organizations with sibling ASes (1,028 CA2O organizations, associated with
  3,772 ASNs). To make this process reproducible and scalable, we design an automated
  approach to recreate our manually-built dataset with high fidelity. The approach
  is able to automatically improve inferences of sibling ASes for each new version
  of CA2O.

ABS: 'Accurate network traffic measurement is required for accounting, bandwidth provisioning
  and detecting DoS attacks. These applications see the traffic as a collection of
  flows they need to measure. As link speeds and the number of flows increase, keeping
  a counter for each flow is too expensive (using SRAM) or slow (using DRAM). The
  current state-of-the-art methods (Ciscos sampled NetFlow) which log periodically
  sampled packets are slow, inaccurate and resource-intensive. Previous work showed
  that at different granularities a small number of heavyhitters accounts for a large
  share of traffic. Our paper introduces a paradigm shift for measurement byconcentrating
  onlyon large flows - those above some threshold such as 0.1% of the link capacity.
  We propose two novel and scalable algorithms for identifying the large flows: sample
  and hold and multistage filters, which take a constant number of memory references
  per packet and use a small amount of memory. If M is the available memory, we show
  analytically that the errors of our new algorithms are proportional to 1/M; by contrast,
  the error of an algorithm based on classical sampling is proportional to 1/sqrt
  M, thus providing much less accuracy for the same amount of memory. We also describe
  further optimizations such as early removal and conservative update that further
  improve the accuracy of our algorithms, as measured on real traffic traces, by an
  order of magnitude. Our schemes allow a new form of accounting called threshold
  accounting in which only flows above a threshold are charged by usage while the
  rest are charged a fixed fee. Threshold accounting generalizes usage-based and duration
  based pricing.'

GEOLOC: Princeton, NJ, US
ABS: This paper reports on a study of traffic patterns among Autonomous Systems (ASes),
  based on traces taken at various points in the Internet. The traces display a highly
  non-uniform distribution of traffic on flows between pairs of hosts, networks, and
  ASes. Aggregation along coarser granularities, such as networks or ASes, accentuates
  this non-uniform distribution. In one typical trace, for example, the top 9% of
  flows between ASes accounts for 86.7% of the packets and 90.7% of the bytes transmitted.
  A highly non-uniform traffic pattern suggests that routers need to maintain only
  limited QoS flow state. The paper discusses the implications of this phenomenon
  on different proposed QoS mechanisms

ABS: Next-generation automotive networks will be characterized by a high number of
  interconnected sensors, actuators and applications on electronic control units communicating
  with each other over a high-speed Ethernet backbone network. As these applications
  have various criticalities, high volumes of fluctuating traffic with different priorities
  will have to be processed in a reliable and efficient manner. To cope with these
  challenges, we present Priority-aware Inter-Server Receive Side Scaling (prioRSS),
  a new SmartNIC-based hardware accelerator designed for automotive compute nodes.
  prioRSS builds upon Receive Side Scaling and introduces priority-awareness into
  an intra- and inter-node load balancer. It uses a priority-partitioned indirection
  table within which flows of the same priority are bundled. Low-latency reconfigurations
  issued by a Network Health Monitoring software allow for adapting the table content
  to changing network conditions. Simulative evaluations and comparisons to a priority-unaware
  version of our design show that prioRSS enables per-priority resource assignments
  without degrading end-to-end packet latencies while using the same table memory
  space. Paired with a priority-aware scheduler, end-to-end latencies of high priority
  flows can be notably reduced compared to average packet latencies, at the expense
  of lowest priority traffic. The best results are acquired when partitioning the
  table proportionally to the associated traffic share.

ABS: We present the largest measurement study to date of Turkmenistan's Web censorship.
  To do so, we developed TMC, which tests the blocking status of millions of domains
  across the three foundational protocols of the Web (DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS). Importantly,
  TMC does not require access to vantage points in the country. We apply TMC to 15.5M
  domains, our results reveal that Turkmenistan censors more than 122K domains, using
  different blocklists for each protocol. We also reverse-engineer these censored
  domains, identifying 6K over-blocking rules causing incidental filtering of more
  than 5.4M domains. Finally, we use Geneva, an open-source censorship evasion tool,
  to discover five new censorship evasion strategies that can defeat Turkmenistan's
  censorship at both transport and application layers. We will publicly release both
  the data collected by TMC and the code for censorship evasion.

GEOLOC: Taoyuan City, TW
ABS: The empirical entropy of the network flow attributes is an essential measure
  for identifying anomalous network traffic. However, computing the exact entropy
  values for high-speed networks in realtime is computationally expensive. Accordingly,
  the present study replaces the complex computations of existing stable random projection
  methods for entropy estimation with a simple table lookup procedure. Notably, the
  size of the lookup table is reduced through a piece-wise linear interpolation heuristic
  in order to facilitate the implementation of the proposed scheme in resource-constrained
  pipeline environments. The proposed architecture enables entropy estimation to be
  performed using both the Log-Mean Estimator (LME) method and the New Estimator of
  Compressed Counting (NECC) algorithm reported in the literature. The feasibility
  of the proposed approach is verified empirically using both real-world network traffic
  traces and synthetic data streams. Moreover, the practical applicability is demonstrated
  via stream-based implementation in the programmable data planes of the NetFPGA-Plus
  framework and a Tofino P4 switch, respectively. The results indicate that the proposed
  tabulation-based entropy estimation scheme allows minimum-sized Ethernet frames
  to be processed with a wire speed of up to several hundred gigabits per second.

ABS: We study concentration in the European Internet upstream access market. The possibility
  of measuring market concentration depends on a correct definition of the market
  itself; however, this is not always possible, because very often in the Internet
  industry antitrust authorities lack reliable pricing and traffic data. We present
  an alternative approach based on the inference of the Internet operators' interconnection
  policies using micro-data from their Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) tables. We assess
  market concentration following a two-step process, first, we propose a price-independent
  algorithm for defining both the vertical and geographical relevant market boundaries;
  then we calculate market concentration indexes using two novel metrics. These assess,
  for each undertaking, its role both in terms of essential network facility and of
  wholesale market dominance. The results, applied to four leading Internet exchange
  points in London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, and Milan, show that some vertical segments
  of these markets are highly concentrated, while others are extremely competitive.
  According to the Merger Guidelines, some of the estimated market concentration values
  would immediately fall within the special attention category.

ABS: Insider threats remain one of the oldest and notorious threats to information
  security. Early detection remains key to preventing insider attacks on an information
  system. The vast amount of enterprise data and the little data points pertaining
  to insider threats calls for techniques to handle the rare class problem. This study
  conceptualised insider threat data as a streaming data problem. Scalability of insider
  threat detection systems represents a gap in knowledge in this disposition. Building
  on existing unsupervised ensemble stream mining techniques, this study proposed
  an insider threat detection algorithm and evaluated it using Centre for Analysis
  of Internet Data (CAIDA) Anonymized trace dataset for 2015. CAIDA datasets was used
  to ascertain the scalability of quantised dictionary construction by applying a
  distributive approach to graph based anomaly detection (GBAD). Pattern learning
  anomaly detection system processes GBAD in a streaming approach. Dictionary construction
  was done using Apache Spark on top of the Hadoop stack. PLADS enhanced GBAD successfully
  discovered the same anomalous substructure within a streaming approach in a fraction
  of the time (642 seconds) it took to process the entire graph (59,743 seconds) when
  applied on the CAIDA Anonymised 2015 dataset. Application of Apache Spark as the
  distributed computing framework for construction of quantised dictionaries of user
  command data depicted a reduction in processing time under varying input sizes and
  number of reducers In conclusion, scalability of Insider Threat Detection systems
  is essential and a complexity analysis of proposed algorithms showed it scales to
  increased number of users of the system. The implemented prototype system using
  Apache Spark scaled to increasing workloads showing its usefulness for early detection
  of insider threats. This study recommends the use of unsupervised learning ensembles
  and distributed frameworks for effective detection of insider threats.

TOPKEY: routeviews-generic, as-organizations
ABS: Researchers and practitioners often face the issue of having to attribute an
  IP address to an organization. For current data this is comparably easy, using services
  like whois or other databases. Similarly, for historic data, several entities like
  the RIPE NCC provide websites that provide access to historic records. For large-scale
  network measurement work, though, researchers often have to attribute millions of
  addresses. For current data, Team Cymru provides a bulk whois service which allows
  bulk address attribution. However, at the time of writing, there is no service available
  that allows historic bulk attribution of IP addresses. Hence, in this paper, we
  introduce and evaluate our ‘Back-to-the-Future whois’ service, allowing historic
  bulk attribution of IP addresses on a daily granularity based on CAIDA Routeviews
  aggregates. We provide this service to the community for free, and also share our
  implementation so researchers can run instances themselves.
