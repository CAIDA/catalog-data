    "description": "An Internet eXchange Point (IX or IXP) is a physical infrastructure used by Internet service providers (ISPs) and content delivery networks (CDNs) to exchange Internet traffic between their networks (Autonomous Systems - ASes). An IXP can be distributed and located in numerous data centers (aka facilities), and a single facility can contain mutliple IXPs. Each IXP has a prefix, or collection of prefixes, which are used by companies/ASes to address machines within the IXP infrastructure. An AS connected to a given IXP is known as a member of that IXP. Internet traffic exchange through an IXP makes use of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) that recognizes ISPs and CDNs by their Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs).",
