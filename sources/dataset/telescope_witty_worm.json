    "description": "This dataset contains information useful for studying the spread of the Witty worm. Data were collected on the UCSD Network Telescope between Fri Mar 19 20:01:40 PST 2004 and Wed Mar 25 00:01:40 PST 2004.  The dataset is exclusively available through Impact.  Up until Feb 2014 the dataset was online in two portions, one public, one restricted. After Feb 2014 the whole Witty dataset was public until mid-2016.  The publicly available set of files contains summarized information that does not individually identify infected computers. These are the files in witty/summaries/public.  The restricted-access set of files that do contain more sensitive information, including packet traces containing complete IP and UDP headers and partial payload received from hosts spreading the Witty worm March 19-24, 2004. It also includes routing tables and summaries. These are the files in witty/data and witty/summaries/restricted/. ",
