    "description": " CAIDA deploys and maintains a globally distributed measurement platform we call Archipelago (Ark). We grow the infrastructure by distributing hardware measurement nodes (2nd gen. Raspberry Pi) with as much geographical and topological diversity as we can to improve our view of the global Internet. Our primary goals with the Ark infrastructure are to:<br> <ul><li> reduce the effort needed to develop and deploy sophisticated large-scale measurements, and</li> <li>provide a step toward a community-oriented measurement infrastructure by allowing collaborators to run their vetted measurement tasks on a security-hardened distributed platform.</li></ul><br> Ark is tailored specifically for active network measurement. This allows Ark to be simpler than some other general-purpose distributed experimental platforms, and it allows us to concentrate on providing facilities that directly address the needs of networking research. In particular, we provide a facility for communication and coordination that makes it easier to write distributed measurements that must work together to achieve a goal. We are working on providing a high-level API to ease the challenges of writing measurement tools. Our goal is to lower the barrier to bringing novel and interesting measurement techniques to life.",
