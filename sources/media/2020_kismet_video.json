    "description": "We will create a knowledge network that will improve the security and functioning of three key but inherently vulnerable systems that underpin all activity on the Internet: the addressing, routing, and naming systems. Lack of attention to security in early design decisions, persistent disagreement about the best path to improvement, and lowest-cost operational practices surrounding these three layers have allowed malicious actors to execute and scale harmful misbehavior including interception and disruption of traffic, denial of service and phishing attacks, and distribution and execution of malware.",
