    "description": "We are now deploying small, inexpensive network measurement nodes, based on the Raspberry Pi, in the Ark measurement infrastructure. Although tiny, a Raspberry Pi is as capable as a desktop system of several generations ago and offers a flexible Linux-powered programmable platform for conducting networking research. These systems can be placed anywhere that is convenient for a hosting site, including on someone's desk, and the transition from deploying traditional rack-mounted servers to Raspberry Pi's will allow us to scale up the Ark infrastructure.",
