A solution should have it's own directory to store a Readme with the actual solution and related files.

It should have the following format:
- metadata (JSON formated metadata for the solution) 
- intro (2~3 sentences )
- solution (just the bits needed, assume domain knowledge)
- background ( the background needed for non domain expert )
