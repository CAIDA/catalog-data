    "datePublished": "2005.07",
    "publisher": "USENIX SRUTI 2005",
    "description": "To understand the current state of network filtering, this paper presents an Internet-wide active measurement spoofing project. Our findings suggest that a large portion of the Internet is vulnerable to spoofing and concerted attacks employing spoofing remain a serious concern.",
