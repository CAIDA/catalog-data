    "description": "\nWe demonstrate the feasibility of Internet spectroscopy techniques for analysis of rate limiting, packet interarrival delay and passive bitrate estimation of cell- or slot-based broadband connections. Working with highly diverse packet trace data, we find that delay's quantization in micro- and millisecond range is ubiquitous in today's Internet and that different providers have strong preferences for specific delay quanta in their infrastructures.\n",
