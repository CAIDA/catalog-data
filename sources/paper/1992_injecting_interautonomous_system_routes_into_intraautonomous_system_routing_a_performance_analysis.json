    "description": "The current TCP/IP Internet may be modeled as an arbitrary\ninterconnection of autonomous systems (AS). An AS is defined to be a\ncollection of internetwork routers managed and administered by a single\nauthority or organization. Typically an AS uses a single routing\nprotocol within its boundaries to generate and propagate routing\ninformation. In this paper we analyse the performance of a technique\nthat injects only partial reachability information derived from the\ninter-AS routing into the intra-AS routing.\n\nThis performance evaluation is based on traffic data obtained from the\nNSFNET backbone. We show, for instance, that injecting just 10% of the\ntotal inter-AS reachability information into the intra-AS routing\npermits the forwarding of at least 85% of the transit traffic without\nresorting to fallback _fault_ mechanisms.",
