    "description": "We document real-world events in .nz (a country-level domain), where two misconfigured domains resulted in a 50% increase on overall traffic. We reproduce and document root causes of this event through experiments, and demonstrate a 500Ã— amplification factor. In response to our disclosure, several DNS software vendors have documented their mitigations, including Google public DNS and Cisco OpenDNS.",
