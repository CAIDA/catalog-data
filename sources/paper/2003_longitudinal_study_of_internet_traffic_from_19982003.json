    "description": "There is growing interest in capturing and analyzing Internet traffic\r\ncharacteristics in pursuit of insights into its evolution. We present a\r\nstudy of one of the few sources of publically available long-term Internet\r\ntraffic workload data, namely the NLANR PMA archive of packet header\r\ntraces. Trace samples were collected at a number of academic, research,\r\nand commercial sites during years 1998-2003. We consider four metrics of\r\ntraffic: bytes, packets, flows, and number of source-destination pairs.\r\nWe also analyze the composition of traffic by protocol.\r\n\r\n",
