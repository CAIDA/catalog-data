    "description": "In this paper we present results of a series of bandwidth estimation\r\nexperiments conducted on a high-speed testbed at the San Diego Supercomputer\r\nCenter and on OC-48 and GigE paths in real world networks. We test and compare\r\npublicly available bandwidth estimation tools: _abing, pathchirp, pathload,_\r\nand _Spruce_. We also tested _Iperf_ which measures achievable TCP throughput. In\r\nthe lab we used two different sources of known and reproducible cross-traffic in\r\na fully controlled environment. In real world networks we had a complete knowledge\r\nof link capacities and had access to SNMP counters for independent cross-traffic\r\nverification. We compare the accuracy and other operational characteristics\r\nof the tools and analyze factors impacting their performance.\r\n",
