    "description": "We collected DNS responses at the University of Auckland\r\nInternet gateway in an SQL database, and analyzed them to detect unusual\r\nbehaviour. Our DNS response data have included typo squatter\r\ndomains, fast flux domains and domains being (ab)used by spammers.\r\nWe observe that current attempts to reduce spam have greatly increased\r\nthe number of A records being resolved. We also observe that the data\r\nlocality of DNS requests diminishes because of domains advertised in\r\nspam.\r\n",
