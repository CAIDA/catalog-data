    "description": "The Internet Engineering Curriculum Repository (IEC) project includes\r\nan archive of teaching and laboratory materials focused on networking\r\nthat are appropriate for a wide variety of classes. This dynamic\r\ncollection of materials makes it easier for faculty to keep their\r\ncourses up to date and complete. It also captures some one-time events,\r\nsuch as colloquium talks, plenary addresses, and conference\r\npresentations that can enrich a student's understanding of a topic. We\r\nalso discuss laboratory components of classes that can be built with\r\nindustry/academia cooperation to improve the educational experience.\r\n\r\n",
