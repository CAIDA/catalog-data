    "description": ". With the advancementof attack methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively, traditional methods used to detect DNS threats, particularly DRDoS attacks, became ineffective. Therefore, in this paper, a new model called proactive feature selection model PFS for early detection of DRDoS attacks based on DNS responses.",
