    "description": "Operators have deployed Multiprotocol Label Switching\r\n(MPLS) in the Internet for over a decade. However, its impact on Internet topology measurements is not well known,\r\nand it is possible for some MPLS configurations to lead to\r\nfalse router-level links in maps derived from traceroute data.\r\nIn this paper, we introduce a measurement-based classification of MPLS tunnels, identifying tunnels where IP hops are\r\nrevealed but not explicitly tagged as label switching routers,\r\nas well as tunnels that obscure the underlying path. Using a large-scale dataset we collected, we show that paths\r\nfrequently cross MPLS tunnels in today\u201bs Internet: in our\r\ndata, at least 30% of the paths we tested traverse an MPLS\r\ntunnel. We also propose and evaluate several methods to\r\nreveal MPLS tunnels that are not explicitly flagged as such:\r\nwe discover that their fraction is significant (up to half the\r\nexplicit tunnel quantity) but most of them do not obscure\r\nIP-level topology discovery.",
