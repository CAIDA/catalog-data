    "description": "We discuss the collection, analysis and visualization of four forms of\r\nInternet traffic data: network topology, workload, performance, and\r\nrouting. Topology data describe network link infrastructure at a\r\nvariety of `protocol' layers. Workload measurements involve the\r\ncollection of traffic information from a point within a network, e.g.,\r\ndata collected by a router or switch or by an independent device\r\npassively monitoring traffic as it traverses a network link.\r\nPerformance measurements involve the introduction of traffic into the\r\nnetwork for the purpose of monitoring delay between specific\r\nend-points. Routing data includes data from Border Gateway Protocol\r\n(BGP) routing tables, which reflect the transit relationships between\r\nindividual Autonomous Systems (ASes) at a given point in time. We\r\ndescribe highlights from these topic areas and their role in the state\r\nof Internet measurement and data analysis today.\r\n\r\n",
