    "description": "Previous research has shown that most of the DNS queries\r\nreaching the root of the hierarchy are bogus . This behavior\r\nderives from two constraints on the system: (1) queries\r\nthat cannot be satisfied locally percolate up to the root of\r\nthe DNS; (2) some caching nameservers are behind packet\r\nfilters or firewalls that allow outgoing queries but block incoming\r\nreplies. These resolvers assume the network failure is\r\ntemporary and retransmit their queries, often aggressively.\r\n\r\nDNS pollution may not be causing any perceivable performance problems. The root servers seem well equipped to\r\nhandle the load. Since DNS messages are small, the pollution\r\ndoes not contribute significantly to the total traffic\r\ngenerated by most organizations. Nonetheless, this paper\r\nprovides a few reasons why network operators should take\r\nthe time to investigate and fix these problems.",
