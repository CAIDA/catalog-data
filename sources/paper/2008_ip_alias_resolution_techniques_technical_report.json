    "description": "The well-known traceroute probing method discovers links between interfaces on Internet routers. IP alias resolution, the process of identifying IP addresses belonging to the same router, is a critical step in producing Internet topology maps. We compare known alias resolution techniques, and suggest a practical combination of techniques that can produce the most accurate and complete IP-to-router mapping.\r\n'' The latest version, 1.1 (2009-01-19), is available as well as the original version published in December of 2008.",
