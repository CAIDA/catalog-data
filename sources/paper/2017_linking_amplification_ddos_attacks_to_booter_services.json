    "datePublished": "2017.10",
    "publisher": "RAID 2017",
    "description": "We present techniques for attributing amplification DDoS attacks to the booter services that launched the attack. Our k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classification algorithm is based on features that are characteristic for a DDoS service, such as the set of reflectors used by that service. This allows us to attribute DDoS attacks based on observations from honeypot amplifiers, augmented with training data from ground truth attack-to-services mappings we generated by subscribing to DDoS services and attacking ourselves in a controlled environment.",
