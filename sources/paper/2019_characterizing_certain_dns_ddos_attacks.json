    "description": "This paper details data science research in the area of Cyber Threat Intelligence applied to a specific type of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. We study a DDoS technique prevalent in the Domain Name System (DNS) for which little malware have been recovered. Using data from a globally distributed set of a passive collectors (pDNS), we create a statistical classifier to identify these attacks and then use unsupervised learning to investigate the attack events and the malware that generates them.",
