After discarding the legitimate traffic from the incoming packets, the remaining data represent a continuous view of anomalous unsolicited traffic, or Internet Background Radiation (IBR). IBR results from a wide range of events, such as backscatter from randomly spoofed source denial-of-service attacks, the automated spread of Internet worms and viruses, scanning of address space by attackers or malware looking for vulnerable targets, and various misconfigurations (e.g. mistyping an IP address). In recent years, traffic destined to darkspace has evolved to include longer-duration, low-intensity events intended to establish and maintain botnets.",

        "description": "Accurate knowledge of AS business relationships is relevant to both technical and economic aspects of the Internet's inter-domain structure. Firstly, AS relationships determine routing policies that introduce a non-trivial set of constraints to paths over which Internet traffic can flow. This has implications for network robustness, traffic engineering, macroscopic topology measurement strategies, and other research and operational considerations. Secondly, macroscopic analysis of AS relationships not only yields insight into the economic underpinnings of business realities in the current Internet, it also provides a solid validation framework for economy-based modeling of Internet topology evolution. Indeed, the Internet AS-level topology and its evolutionary dynamics are consequences of business decisions that Internet players make. Therefore, the ability to infer AS relationships is a promising tool for understanding and modeling the economic forces that drive the evolution of the Internet topology and its hierarchy.",

We grow the infrastructure by distributing hardware measurement nodes (2nd gen. Raspberry Pi) with as much geographical and topological diversity as we can to improve our view of the global Internet. Our primary goals with the Ark infrastructure are to:<br> <ul><li> reduce the effort needed to develop and deploy sophisticated large-scale measurements, and</li> <li>provide a step toward a community-oriented measurement infrastructure by allowing collaborators to run their vetted measurement tasks on a security-hardened distributed platform.</li></ul><br> Ark is tailored specifically for active network measurement. This allows Ark to be simpler than some other general-purpose distributed experimental platforms, and it allows us to concentrate on providing facilities that directly address the needs of networking research. In particular, we provide a facility for communication and coordination that makes it easier to write distributed measurements that must work together to achieve a goal. We are working on providing a high-level API to ease the challenges of writing measurement tools. Our goal is to lower the barrier to bringing novel and interesting measurement techniques to life.",

By convention, the first two octets encode the Autonomous System Number (ASN) of the operator that sets the community. The next two octets encode an arbitrary value to denote some property relevant to routing policy. Unfortunately, the specific values and semantics of this BGP attribute are not standardized. Also, the community is a transitive optional attribute, meaning that BGP implementations do not have to recognize this attribute. It is at the network operator's discretion to accept it or pass it on to another AS.",
