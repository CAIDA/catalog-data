### Introduction
We will be using BGPTools to identify the set of prefixes that are announced by the organization, and 
Fantail to collect the Ark traces to the those prefixes.

### Collect Prefixes  (bgptools)
- Go to **bgp.tools** and type the organization name into the "Start here..." field. 
  <div style="margin-left:2em">
    <img width="400" src="images/start-here.png"/>
  </div>
- Choose the best **AS number** on in the "Item" column for your organization.
  <div style="margin-left:2em">
    <img width="400" src="images/select-asn.png"/>
  </div>
- Download **https://bgp.tools/table.txt** and get all the prefixes for **AS number**. 
  ~~~
  wget https://bgp.tools/table.txt
  grep ' 7377$' table-14-03-24.txt | grep -v ':' | cut -f 1 -d ' ' - | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/.\{1\}$//' > prefixes.txt 
  ~~~ 

### Collect Traces (fantail) 
- Log into **fantail.caida.org** and select **Query traceroute paths**
  <div style="margin-left:2em">
    <img width="400" src="images/query-traceroute-paths.png"/>
  </div>
- Inside the **Query** box, set **Method** to **[ ] dest** and copy/paste the prefixes from
  **prefixes.txt** file into the **Target Address/Prefix** field. 
  <div style="margin-left:2em">
    <img width="400" src="images/dests.png"/>
  </div>

- Wait for the **Query Results** page to come up.
- Download **JSON results**
  **prefixes.txt** file into the **Target Address/Prefix** field. 
  <div style="margin-left:2em">
    <img width="400" src="images/download-json.png"/>
  </div>

- Copy/Paste the prefixes from the prefixes.txt file. tab will give you a list of the ASN's prefixes.
PyIPMeta is a Python library that provides a high-level interface for historical and realtime geolocation metadata lookups using Maxmind GeoIP and/or NetAcuity (Digital Element) geolocation databases.

#### Pre-requisites

Before installing PyIPMeta, you will need:
- [libipmeta(>= 3.0.0)]( https://github.com/CAIDA/libipmeta)
- Python setuptools (`sudo apt install python-setuptools` on Ubuntu) 
- Python development headers (`sudo apt install python-dev` on Ubuntu)

Detailed installation and usage instructions [here]( https://github.com/CAIDA/pyipmeta ).

# solution #

The code below serves as an example of how to use the IP to ASN Mapper tool to map a list of IP addresses to their respective Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) using data from CAIDA's RouteViews prefix-to-AS snapshots. It demonstrates the integration with pandas for efficient data handling and showcases the tool's capability to perform historical analysis by utilizing a snapshot from a specific date.

### Variables to Be Modified by the User:
- **DataFrame Source**: Replace the example IP address list or the DataFrame initialization with loading your data from a CSV, JSON, or Parquet file. Use the commented code as a guide to load your data file.
- **date = `datetime.datetime(2020, 3, 4)**: Change this to the specific date for which you want to fetch the RouteViews prefix-to-AS snapshot. Ensure the format is datetime.datetime(YYYY, MM, DD).

### Map between ips and origin asns using PyIPMeta

For this solution, clone **PyIPMeta** from [here]( https://github.com/CAIDA/pyipmeta)
More data can be found at http://data.caida.org/datasets/routing/routeviews-prefix2as/

### Background

**What is an IPv4 address prefix?** 
- An *IP address* is a 32-bit unique address that is used to recognize a computer network or a machine. All computers on   the same data network share the same IP address.
- An IPv4 address is typically written in decimal format as 4 8-bit fields separated by a period. Eg. 182.24.0.0/18 
- An *IPv4 address prefix* is the prefix of an IPv4 address. 
- e.g. Consider the IPV4 address : 182.24.0.0/18 
- In this case, 18 is the length of the prefix. 
- The prefix is the first 18 bits of the IP address. 
- More information on IPv4 addresses can be found [here]( https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/806-0916/6ja85399u/index.html#:~:text=The%20IPv4%20address%20is%20a,bit%20fields%20separated%20by%20periods )

**What is forwarding/How does forwarding work?** 
- Fowarding means sending incoming information packets to the appropriate destination interface. This is done by routers with the help of a forwarding table. 
- Routers scan the destination IP prefix and locate a match using a forwarding table to determine the packet's next hop. 
- In cases of prefix overlap, where an incoming IP prefix map may match multiple IP entries in the table, the *Longest Prefix Matching Rule* is used to determine the next hop. 

**What is the Longest Prefix Matching Rule?** 
- Longest Prefix Match is an algorithm to lookup the destination an IP prefixâ€™s next hop from the router. 
It finds the prefix matching the given IP address and returns the corresponding router node.
- The router which corresponds to the IP address with the longest matching prefix is selected as the destination router node.
- Consider the following example:
| IP Prefix        |   Router      |
| -------------    | ------------- |
| 192.168.20.16/28 | A             |
| 192.168.0.0/16   | B             |

- For example, for the given incoming IP address:  192.168.20.19 
- **Node A** is selected as the destination router node as it contains the *longer matching prefix* i.e. 192.168.20.16 
- Source: [link]( https://www.lewuathe.com/longest-prefix-match-with-trie-tree.html ) 
- More information can be found [here]( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-prefix-matching-in-routers/ )
 
**What is an AS?**
- AS stands for Autonomous system.
- It can be broadly be thought of as a single organization, or a collection of routers that route groups of IP addresses under a common administration, typically a large organization or an ISP (Internet Service Provider). 
- It is a connected group of one or more IP addresses (known as IP prefixes) that provide a common way to route internet traffic to systems outside the AS.
- More information on AS can be found [here]( https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/352/notes/autonomous_systems.html) and [here](https://catalog.caida.org/details/media/2016_as_intro_topology_windas_intro_topology_wind.pdf)

### Caveats
- **Multi-origin AS** : Some prefixes originate from multiple AS's (which could be siblings or distinct organizations).
This makes it more challenging to interpret the appearance of a matching destination IP address, as the address could be on a router operated by any one of the origin AS's.  
- **Third-party AS's** 
- Border routers may use a third-party address when responding to traceroute probes. 
- A third-party address is an IP address corresponding to an AS that is not on the path toward a destination.

### Note:
- `pyasn` can also be used for mapping between ipv4 addresses and origin asns.
- The `pyasn` object is be initialized using an IPASN datafile. 
- It also provides extremely fast lookups for IP addresses, as it returns the origin asns and the BGP prefixes it matches.
- Detailed installation instructions and more information on Usage and IPASN data files [found here]( https://github.com/hadiasghari/pyasn ).
- Note that the current `pyipmeta` **does not support** `ipv6`, whereas `pyasn` does. 

However, `pyipmeyta` provides **greater flexbility** as it provides the geographical information as well. 

For example, `ipm.lookup('192.172.226.97')` returns:

`[{'connection_speed': '', 'city': '', 'asn_ip_count': 0, 'post_code': '', 'lat_long': (37.750999450683594, -97.8219985961914), 'region': '', 'area_code': 0, 'asns': [], 'continent_code': 'NA', 'metro_code': 0, 'matched_ip_count': 1, 'region_code': 0, 'country_code': 'US', 'id': 223, 'polygon_ids': []}]`

- This object can then be parsed to map between IP addresses and origin asns.
