### IPv6 address ###
• An *IPv6 address* is a 128-bit unique address that is used to recognize a computer network or a machine. All computers on the same data network share the same IPv6 address.\
• IPv6 addressing is a successor to IPv4 addressing. \
• An IPv4 address is 32 bit, whereas an IPv6 address is 128 bit. \
• **IPv6 Prefix** - The leftmost fields of the IPv6 address contain the prefix, which is used for routing IPv6 packets. \
• IPv6 prefixes have the following format:\
`prefix/length in bits` \
• e.g. Consider the IPv6 address : `2001:db8:3c4d:0015:0000:0000:1a2f:1a2b/48` \
• In this case, 48 is the length of the prefix, i.e. the IPv6 prefix is the first 48 bits of the IP address - `2001:db8:3c4d` \
• More information on IPv6 addresses and prefixes found [here]( https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19253-01/816-4554/6maoq01nv/index.html ).
