## Introduction:

The following solution parses through an [arks ipv4/ipv6 warts files](https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/request_user_info_forms/ark ) and produces a simple traceroute in the following order: src, ip1, ip2, ip3..ipn, dst where ip1 - ipn are listed in increasing order of probe-ttl values

### Solution -
For this solution, we used Drakker Lig's [scamper-pywarts] (https://github.com/drakkar-lig/scamper-pywarts). You will need to have this on your computer in-addition to our modified "traceroute.py" file to run this recipe. 

**Example Usage:** 
~~~bash 

$ python parse_from_cmd.py -f < .warts file >
~~~

**Example Output:** 
~~~bash

### Script Details: 
parse_from_cmd.py: 
â€¢ Is a very simple program that takes a warts file as its standard input and prints all records it found



~~~python
import warts
import sys
import argparse
from warts.traceroute import Traceroute

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("-f", type= str, default=None, dest= "warts_file", help="Path to a .warts file.")
args = parser.parse_args()

if args.warts_file is None:
        print("warts_file not found")
        print(sys.argv[0],"-f warts_file")
        sys.exit()
        
warts_file = args.warts_file

with open(warts_file, 'rb') as f:
    while True:
        record = warts.parse_record(f)
        if record == None:
            break
        print('\n')
        print(record)
        if isinstance(record, Traceroute):
            for hop in record.hops:
                print(hop)
            print('\n')

## Background: 

### What is Scamper?
Scamper is designed to actively probe destinations in the Internet in parallel (at a specified packets-per-second rate) so that bulk data can be collected in a timely fashion. Scamper's native output file format is called warts: a warts file contains substantial meta data surrounding each individual measurement conducted, as well as substantial detail of responses received. The measurements conducted can range from simple to complex. An example of a simple measurement is where a single measurement method (e.g. traceroute) is used on a list of IP addresses to conduct a bulk measurement. A more complex measurement might be where the outcome of a previous test influences what happens next: for example, for each hop in a traceroute path, infer the address of the outgoing interface for the previous hop. Complex measurements are conducted by connecting to a running scamper process with a driver program which contains the logic.

### What is a Traceroute?
Traceroute is a computer network diagnostic command for displaying possible routes (paths) and measuring transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network.
More information can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute)

#### --> TTL 
TTL stands for Time To Live. When a TCP packet is sent, its TTL is set, which is the number of routers (hops) it can pass through before the packet is discarded. As the packet passes through a router the TTL is decremented until, when the TTL reaches zero, the packet is destroyed and an ICMP "time exceeded" message is returned. The return message's TTL is set by the terminating router when it creates the packet, and decremented normally.

More information on TTL can be found [here]( http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave.Marshall/Internet/node77.html ).
