A recipe should have it's own directory to store a Readme.md with the recipe and related files.

If you are providing code snippet it should contain the following:
- metadata (JSON formated metadata for the solution)
- intro (2~3 sentences )
- solution (just the bits needed, assume domain knowledge)
- background ( the background needed for non domain expert )
