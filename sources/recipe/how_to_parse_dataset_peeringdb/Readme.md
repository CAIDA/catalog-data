### Dataset ###
#### PeeringDB
- An online database of peering policies, traffic volumes and geographic presence of participating networks. 
- PeeringDB, a non-profit member-based organization, has been established to support practical needs of network operators. However, it is also a valuable source of information for researchers. The first version of PeeringDB resided in a MySQL database, which was not scalable and lacked security features and data validation mechanisms. It presented potential risks of exposing contact information to spammers, and contained typos. Starting at the end of March 2016, PeeringDB switched to a new data schema and API.
