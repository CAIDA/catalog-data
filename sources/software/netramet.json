    "description": "NeTraMet is an open-source (GPL) implementation of the RTFM architecture for Network Traffic Flow Measurement, developed and supported by Nevil Brownlee at the University of Auckland. Nevil also developed a version of NeTraMet which uses the CoralReef library to read packet headers. This 'CoralCoralReef NeTraMet meter' can work with any CoralReef data source; it has been tested on both CAIDA and NLANR trace files, and on DAG and Apptel ATM interface cards.",
