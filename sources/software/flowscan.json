    "description": "Authored in 2000, FlowScan analyzes and reports on Internet Protocol (IP) flow data exported by routers. Consisting of Perl scripts and modules, FlowScan binds together (1) a flow collection engine (a patched version of cflowd), (2) a high performance database (Round Robin Database - RRD), and (3) a visualization tool (RRDtool). FlowScan produces graph images that provide a continuous, near real-time view of the network border traffic.",
