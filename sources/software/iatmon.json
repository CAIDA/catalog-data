    "description": "During the last decade, unsolicited one-way Internet traffic has been used to study malicious activity on the Internet. To make changes in composition of one-way traffic aggregates more detectable, we have developed iatmon (Inter-Arrival Time Monitor), a freely available measurement and analysis tool that allows one to separate one-way traffic into clearly-defined subsets.",
