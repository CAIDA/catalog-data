    "description": "Topostats is a package of programs that calculate various statistics on network topologies (that is, on graphs). The computed statistics are defined in the paper 'Lessons from Three Views of the Internet Topology: Technical Report', which also gives a sample of the computed statistics. The topostats package computes most but not all of these statistics, and this package does not itself make any plots.",
