### What is an AS

- AS stands for Autonomous system
- It can be broadly be thought of as a single organization, or a collection of routers that route groups of IP addresses under a common administration, typically a large organization or an ISP (Internet Service Provider).
- It is a connected group of one or more IP addresses (known as IP prefixes) that provide a common way to route internet traffic to systems outside the AS.
- Each AS is responsible for routing traffic within itself. This is known as intra-AS routing.
- Each AS can also route traffic between itself and other autonomous systems. This is known as inter-AS routing.
- More information on AS can be found [here]( https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/352/notes/autonomous_systems.html) and [here](https://www.caida.org/publications/presentations/2016/as_intro_topology_wind/as_intro_topology_wind.pdf)

### What is an ASN

- Each AS is assigned a unique ASN, or *Autonomous System Number* that allows it to be uniquely identified during routing.

### What is an AS Relationship

- An AS Relationship is the determined routing polocy between two ASes.
- The three most commo types of AS Relationships are:
  - customer-to-provider (c2p) (or if looked at from the opposite direction,  provider-to-customer p2c),
  - peer-to-peer (p2p),
  - sibling-to-sibling (s2s)
- A p2p link connect two ISPs who have agreed to exchange traffic between each other and their customer's. This can allow growing ISPs savings on transit costs compared to c2p relationships.
- An s2s link connects two ASes with a common administrative boundary. Such links usually appear as a result of mergers and acquisitions, or under certain network management scenarios.
- More information on AS Relationships can be found [here](https://www.caida.org/data/as-relationships/)
