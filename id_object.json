        "context": "\n## **<ins>Introduction</ins>**\n\nThe following solution will help the user create a Python dictionary where the key is a given asn, and the values are the asn, it's customer cone, and customer cone size. This solution and script is usable for IPv4.\n\n## **<ins>Solution</ins>**\n\nThe following [script](as-customer-cone.py) produces a dictionary as_2_cone that maps an ASN to it's customer cone and size. The script has one flag: -p (.ppdc-ases) since you'll only need to provide a .ppdc-ases file in either a .txt or encoded .bz2 format.\n\n~~~json\n{\n    \"asn0\" : {\n        \"asn\" : \"asn0\",\n        \"cone\" : [ \"asn0\", \"asn1\", \"...\", \"asnM\" ],\n        \"size\" : 0\n    },\n}\n~~~\n\n### Usage\n\nThe dataset that is used for this script can be downloaded [here](https://www.caida.org/data/as-relationships/). Below is an example of running the script to get IPv4 customer cones from January 1, 2020. Reminder, this script can handle both .txt and .bz2 files.\n\n~~~bash\npython3 as-customer-cone.py -p 20200101.ppdc-ases.txt\n~~~\n\nBelow is the helper method the script uses to parses the .ppdc-ases file line-by-line to update as_2_cone with a mapping between a given asn, its cone, and cone size.\n\n~~~Python\n# Given an line of a .ppdc-ases file, get the asn and its Customer Cone.\ndef parse_ppdc_ases_line(curr_line):\n    global as_2_cone\n\n    # Edge Case: Skip any commented lines.\n    if curr_line[0] == \"#\":\n        return\n\n    customer_cone = curr_line.split()\n    asn = int(customer_cone[0])\n    customer_cone_size = len(customer_cone[1:])\n\n    # Update as_2_cone with this asn's customer_cone_size.\n    if asn not in as_2_cone:\n        as_2_cone[asn] = {}\n\n    as_2_cone[asn][\"asn\"] = asn\n    as_2_cone[asn][\"cone\"] = customer_cone\n    as_2_cone[asn][\"size\"] = customer_cone_size\n~~~\n\n## **<ins>Background</ins>**\n\n### What is an AS\n\n- AS stands for Autonomous system\n- It can be broadly be thought of as a single organization, or a collection of routers that route groups of IP addresses under a common administration, typically a large organization or an ISP (Internet Service Provider).\n- It is a connected group of one or more IP addresses (known as IP prefixes) that provide a common way to route internet traffic to systems outside the AS.\n- Each AS is responsible for routing traffic within itself. This is known as intra-AS routing.\n- Each AS can also route traffic between itself and other autonomous systems. This is known as inter-AS routing.\n- More information on AS can be found [here]( https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/352/notes/autonomous_systems.html) and [here](https://www.caida.org/publications/presentations/2016/as_intro_topology_wind/as_intro_topology_wind.pdf)\n\n### What is an ASN\n\n- Each AS is assigned a unique ASN, or *Autonomous System Number* that allows it to be uniquely identified during routing.\n\n### What is an AS Relationship\n\n- An AS Relationship is the determined routing polocy between two ASes.\n- The three most commo types of AS Relationships are:\n  - customer-to-provider (c2p) (or if looked at from the opposite direction,  provider-to-customer p2c),\n  - peer-to-peer (p2p),\n  - sibling-to-sibling (s2s)\n- A p2p link connect two ISPs who have agreed to exchange traffic between each other and their customer's. This can allow growing ISPs savings on transit costs compared to c2p relationships.\n- An s2s link connects two ASes with a common administrative boundary. Such links usually appear as a result of mergers and acquisitions, or under certain network management scenarios.\n- More information on AS Relationships can be found [here](https://www.caida.org/data/as-relationships/)\n\n### What is a Customer Cone\n\n- A customer cone is the set of ASes, prefixes, or addresses that can be reached from a given AS following only customer links.\n- An AS A's AS customer cone as the AS A itself plus all the ASes that can be reached from A following only p2c links in BGP paths we observed.\n  - In other words, A's customer cone contains A, plus A's customers, plus its customers' customers, and so on.\n- The size of the customer cone of an AS reflects the number of other elements (ASes,  prefixes, or addresses) found in it's set.\n- An AS in the customer cone is assumed to pay, directly or indirectly, for transit, and provides a coarse metric of the size or influence of an AS in the routing system.\n\n### File Format: .ppdc-ases\n\nFor the purpose of this solution, we'll be skipping over any commented lines. Each line is a customer cone where asn0 is the \"head\" of the cone and all asns after is are within its cone.\n\n~~~text\n# inferred clique:\n\n# total size: ...\n\n<asn0>|<asn1>|...|<asnM>\n~~~\n",

        "description": "Accurate knowledge of AS business relationships is relevant to both technical and economic aspects of the Internet's inter-domain structure. Firstly, AS relationships determine routing policies that introduce a non-trivial set of constraints to paths over which Internet traffic can flow. This has implications for network robustness, traffic engineering, macroscopic topology measurement strategies, and other research and operational considerations. Secondly, macroscopic analysis of AS relationships not only yields insight into the economic underpinnings of business realities in the current Internet, it also provides a solid validation framework for economy-based modeling of Internet topology evolution. Indeed, the Internet AS-level topology and its evolutionary dynamics are consequences of business decisions that Internet players make. Therefore, the ability to infer AS relationships is a promising tool for understanding and modeling the economic forces that drive the evolution of the Internet topology and its hierarchy.",

        "description": "Anycast has been widely adopted by today&rsquo;s Internet services, including DNS, CDN, and DDoS protection, in which the same IP address is announced from distributed locations and clients are directed to the topologically-nearest service replica. Prior research has focused on various aspects of anycast, either its usage in particular services such as DNS or characterizing its adoption by Internetwide active probing methods. In this paper, we first explore an alternative approach to characterize anycast based on previously collected global BGP routing information. Leveraging state-of-the-art active measurement results as near-ground-truth, our passive method without requiring any Internet-wide probes can achieve 90% accuracy in detecting anycast prefixes. More importantly, our approach uncovers anycast prefixes that have been missed by prior datasets based on active measurements. While investigating the root causes of inaccuracy, we reveal that anycast routing has been entangled with the increased adoption of remote peering, a type of layer-2 interconnection where an IP network may peer at an IXP remotely without being physically present at the IXP. The invisibility of remote peering from layer-3 breaks the assumption of the shortest AS paths on BGP and causes an unintended impact on anycast performance. We identify such cases from BGP routing information and observe that at least 19.2% of anycast prefixes have been potentially impacted by remote peering.",

We grow the infrastructure by distributing hardware measurement nodes (2nd gen. Raspberry Pi) with as much geographical and topological diversity as we can to improve our view of the global Internet. Our primary goals with the Ark infrastructure are to:<br> <ul><li> reduce the effort needed to develop and deploy sophisticated large-scale measurements, and</li> <li>provide a step toward a community-oriented measurement infrastructure by allowing collaborators to run their vetted measurement tasks on a security-hardened distributed platform.</li></ul><br> Ark is tailored specifically for active network measurement. This allows Ark to be simpler than some other general-purpose distributed experimental platforms, and it allows us to concentrate on providing facilities that directly address the needs of networking research. In particular, we provide a facility for communication and coordination that makes it easier to write distributed measurements that must work together to achieve a goal. We are working on providing a high-level API to ease the challenges of writing measurement tools. Our goal is to lower the barrier to bringing novel and interesting measurement techniques to life.",

In this work we use k-cores, an element of graph theory, to define which ASes compose the core of the Internet and to track the evolution of the core since 1999. Specifically, we investigate whether large players in the Internet content and CDN ecosystem belong to the core and, if so, since when. In addition, we examine differences between the IPv4 and IPv6 cores. We further investigate regional differences in the evolution of large content providers. Finally, we show that the core of the Internet has incorporated an increasing number of content ASes in recent years. To enable reproducibility of this work, we provide a website to allow interactive analysis of our datasets to detect, for example, &ldquo;up and coming&rdquo; ASes using customized queries.",

Despite significant progress in the development of relationship inference algorithms, the resulting inferences are impractical for many critical real-world applications, cannot offer adequate predictability in the configuration of routing policies, and suffer from inference oscillations. To achieve more practical and stable relationship inference, we first illuminate the root causes of the contradiction between these shortcomings and the near-perfect validation results for AS-Rank, the state-of-the-art relationship inference algorithm. Using a &quot;naive&quot; inference approach as a benchmark, we find that available validation datasets over-represent AS links with easier inference requirements. We identify which types of links are harder to infer and develop appropriate validation subsets to enable more representative evaluation.",

        "description": "Recent reports show that BGP hijacking has increased substantially. BGP hijacking allows malicious ASes to obtain IP prefixes for spamming as well as intercepting or blackholing traffic. While systems to prevent hijacks are hard to deploy and require the cooperation of many other organizations, techniques to detect hijacks have been a popular area of study. In this paper, we classify detected hijack events in order to document BGP detectors output and understand the nature of reported events. We introduce four categories of BGP hijack: typos, prepending mistakes, origin changes, and forged AS paths. We leverage AS hegemony &ndash; a measure of dependency in AS relationship &ndash; to identify forged AS paths in a fast and efficient way. Besides, we utilize heuristic approaches to find common operators&rsquo; mistakes such as typos and AS prepending mistakes. The proposed approach classifies our collected ground truth into four categories with 95.71% accuracy. We characterize publicly reported alarms (e.g. BGPMon) with our trained classifier and find 4%, 1%, and 2% of typos, prepend mistakes, and BGP hijacking with a forged AS path, respectively.",

We present Blink, a data-driven system exploiting TCP-induced signals to detect failures. The key intuition behind Blink is that a TCP flow exhibits a predictable behavior upon disruption: retransmitting the same packet over and over, at epochs exponentially spaced in time. When compounded over multiple flows, this behavior creates a strong and characteristic failure signal. Blink efficiently analyzes TCP flows, at line rate, to: (i) select flows to track; (ii) reliably and quickly detect major traffic disruptions; and (iii) recover data-plane connectivity, via next-hops compatible with the operator&rsquo;s policies.",

By convention, the first two octets encode the Autonomous System Number (ASN) of the operator that sets the community. The next two octets encode an arbitrary value to denote some property relevant to routing policy. Unfortunately, the specific values and semantics of this BGP attribute are not standardized. Also, the community is a transitive optional attribute, meaning that BGP implementations do not have to recognize this attribute.

        "description": "The Internet is a complex ecosystem composed of thousands of Autonomous Systems (ASs) operated by independent organizations; each AS having a very limited view outside its own network. These complexities and limitations impede network operators to finely pinpoint the causes of service degradation or disruption when the problem lies outside of their network. In this paper, we present Chocolatine, a solution to detect remote connectivity loss using Internet Background Radiation (IBR) through a simple and efficient method. IBR is unidirectional unsolicited Internet traffic, which is easily observed by monitoring unused address space. IBR features two remarkable properties: it is originated worldwide, across diverse ASs, and it is incessant. We show that the number of IP addresses observed from an AS or a geographical area follows a periodic pattern. Then, using Seasonal ARIMA to statistically model IBR data, we predict the number of IPs for the next time window. Significant deviations from these predictions indicate an outage. We evaluated Chocolatine using data from the UCSD Network Telescope, operated by CAIDA, with a set of documented outages. Our experiments show that the proposed methodology achieves a good trade-off between true-positive rate (90%) and false- positive rate (2%) and largely outperforms CAIDA&rsquo;s own IBR based detection method. Furthermore, performing a comparison against other methods, i.e., with BGP monitoring and active probing, we observe that Chocolatine shares a large common set of outages with them in addition to many specific outages that would otherwise go undetected.",

        "description": "We present the design, implementation, evaluation, and validation of a system that automatically learns to extract router names (router identifiers) from hostnames stored by network operators in different DNS zones, which we represent by regular expressions (regexes). Our supervised-learning approach evaluates automatically generated candidate regexes against sets of hostnames for IP addresses that other alias resolution techniques previously inferred to identify interfaces on the same router. Conceptually, if three conditions hold: (1) a regex extracts the same value from a set of hostnames associated with IP addresses on the same router; (2) the value is unique to that router; and (3) the regex extracts names for multiple routers in the suffix, then we conclude the regex accurately represents the naming convention for the suffix. We train our system using router aliases inferred from active probing to learn regexes for 2550 different suffixes.",

        "description": "Monitoring mobile network performance is critical for optimizing the QoE of mobile apps. Until now, few studies have considered the actual network performance that mobile apps experience in a per-app or per-server granularity. In this paper, we analyze a two-year-long dataset collected by a crowdsourcing per-app measurement tool to gain new insights into mobile network behavior and application performance. We observe that only a small portion of WiFi networks can work in high-speed mode, and more than one-third of the observed ISPs still have not deployed 4G networks. For cellular networks, the DNS settings on smartphones can have a significant impact on mobile app network performance. Moreover, we notice that instant messaging (IM) and voice over IP (VoIP) services nowadays are not as performant as Web services, because the traffic using XMPP experiences longer latencies than HTTPS. We propose an automatic performance degradation detection and localization method for finding possible network problems in our huge, imbalanced and sparse dataset. Our evaluation and case studies show that our method is effective and the running time is acceptable.",

Characterizing small-scale failures of last mile networks is essential to improving Internet reliability. In this paper, we develop and evaluate an approach to detect Internet failure events that affect multiple users simultaneously using measurements from the Thunderping project. Thunderping probes addresses across the U.S. when the areas in which they are geo-located are affected by severe weather alerts. It detects a disruption event when an IP address ceases to respond to pings. In this paper, we focus on simultaneous disruptions of multiple addresses that are related to each other by geography and ISP, and thus are indicative of a shared cause. Using binomial testing, we detect groups of per-IP disruptions that are unlikely to have happened independently. We characterize these dependent disruption events and present results that challenge conventional wisdom on how such outages affect Internet address blocks.",

        "description": "In this article, we study the political use of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, a particular form of cyberattack that disables web services by flooding them with high levels of data traffic. We argue that websites in nondemocratic regimes should be especially prone to this type of attack, particularly around political focal points such as elections. This is due to two mechanisms: governments employ DoS attacks to censor regime-threatening information, while at the same time, activists use DoS attacks as a tool to publicly undermine the government&rsquo;s authority. We analyze these mechanisms by relying on measurements of DoS attacks based on large-scale Internet traffic data. Our results show that in authoritarian countries, elections indeed increase the number of DoS attacks. However, these attacks do not seem to be directed primarily against the country itself but rather against other states that serve as hosts for news websites from this country",

        "description": "Geo-locating BGP prefixes can help us understand routing anomalies, prefix aggregation, or reveal what regions are affected by an Internet outage. Our work shows that the naive approach to prefix geo-location&mdash;simply mapping each IP address to its corresponding geo-location&mdash;can be ambiguous because a prefix may contain another, separately-announced prefix that maps to a different geographical location. Should the containing prefix also map to the locations of the contained prefix? We show that this question is difficult to answer and characterize the scope of these ambiguities by geo-locating around 680,000 prefixes to countries, regions, and cities using both GeoLite and NetAcuity Edge. We find that 0.3% of prefixes are ambiguous with respect to countries but these prefixes constitute 8.5% of the IPv4 address space. In the second part of our work, we study the mappings from prefix to location. We find that most prefixes map to only a single city but the shorter a prefix, the more locations it maps to. Our dataset however contains outliers, e.g., a /23 that maps to as many as 127 (potentially spoofed) countries. Our work takes a first look at prefix geo-location and identifies issues one should be aware of, which paves the way towards more sophisticated applications such as the geo-location of autonomous systems. We make our code and datasets publicly available to facilitate further analysis.",

        "description": "The Internet is transforming our society, necessitating a quantitative understanding of Internet traffic. Our team collects and curates the largest publicly available Internet traffic data containing 50 billion packets. Utilizing a novel hypersparse neural network analysis of &ldquo;video&rdquo; streams of this traffic using 10,000 processors in the MIT SuperCloud reveals a new phenomena: the importance of otherwise unseen leaf nodes and isolated links in Internet traffic. Our neural network approach further shows that a two-parameter modified Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution accurately describes a wide variety of source/destination statistics on moving sample windows ranging from 100,000 to 100,000,000 packets over collections that span years and continents. The inferred model parameters distinguish different network streams and the model leaf parameter strongly correlates with the fraction of the traffic in different underlying network topologies. The hypersparse neural network pipeline is highly adaptable and different network statistics and training models can be incorporated with simple changes to the image filter functions.",

        "description": "BGP hijacks remain an acute problem in today&rsquo;s Internet, with widespread consequences. While hijack detection systems are readily available, they typically rely on a priori prefix-ownership information and are reactive in nature. In this work, we take on a new perspective on BGP hijacking activity: we introduce and track the long-term routing behavior of serial hijackers, networks that repeatedly hijack address blocks for malicious purposes, often over the course of many months or even years. Based on a ground truth dataset that we construct by extracting information from network operator mailing lists, we illuminate the dominant routing characteristics of serial hijackers, and how they differ from legitimate networks.We then distill features that can capture these behavioral differences and train a machine learning model to automatically identify Autonomous Systems (ASes) that exhibit characteristics similar to serial hijackers. Our classifier identifies &asymp; 900 ASes with similar behavior in the global IPv4 routing table. We analyze and categorize these networks, finding a wide range of indicators of malicious activity, misconfiguration, as well as benign hijacking activity. Our work presents a solid first step towards identifying and understanding this important category of networks, which can aid network operators in taking proactive measures to defend themselves against prefix hijacking and serve as input for current and future detection systems.",
